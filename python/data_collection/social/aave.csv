AAVE Decentralized Credit Union Protocol

Abstract
Flaws in the current system for personal credit cards generate a massive social cost, such as expensive handling fees and high interest rates. The revolving interest of credit cards is a cause for poverty among the working and middle classes as credit card debt in developed countries reaches trillions of dollars. Bank institutions supervise personal lines of credit when such finances are in fact our savings. Furthermore, these institutions must collect data on individuals in terms of employment, income, insurance, asset, and shopping records, yet leakage of personal data continues to occur.
On the basis of a smart contract, we propose a Decentralized Credit Union Protocol (DCUP) for people to build basic social credit based on their social circles. No third party credit rating would be required to provide a safe, highly competitive, and transparent credit financing market with low handling fees. The credit would be instantly available for exchange into cash or cash advances. This compensates for the high costs and inconveniences of personal credit financing in the flawed credit card system.

Introduction
Personal credit is established on an individual’s social reputation, which can be extended from the knowledge and trust of friends and colleagues to even broader areas. If social reputation can be calculated into an asset price, then social credit can be generated to provide everyone a line of credit that can be converted to cash whenever needed. This is the concept behind the DCUP - Decentralized Credit Union Protocol.
The DCUP is an inclusive financing credit transaction protocol that can protect personal information without relying on third party credit ratings. The basic principle is that everyone can deposit Stable Coins into a smart contract for staking and offer credit lines via friend lists. Such mutual credit extension gives everyone in the friend list a credit line and instant financing access without requiring credit rating from a joint credit information center or bank institution. In this way, the security of personal information is maintained while inclusive financing can be simultaneously achieved to satisfy personal needs for instant credit transactions and financing.
Unlike traditional credit financing, the DCUP is based on social reputation rather than P2P lending. Social reputation is reflected through digital identities. Let’s imagine that everyone has a digital identity representing his or her social reputation among the friend lists in our communications or social media software. Social reputation must be acquired from the trust of friends rather than third party credit rating algorithms, as this trust comes from actual credit extensions among different friends. During the process of credit extension, an individual must deposit Stable Coins into a smart contract for staking before the credits can be freely extended to each friend based on self-determined interest rates, credit limits, and terms.
Individuals with good social reputation can use the credit lines at any time, just like having a virtual credit card for cash advance or credit loan. Needless to say, individuals who are not trusted by their friends will not be able to receive credit extensions and thereby excluded from using the credit lines.
Credit grantors use DCUP because they are motivated by the interest revenue from credit financing. Just like the principles behind credit cards, individuals with good social reputation can make payments through personal credit lines or obtain credit loans at any time. An interest will be charged if the principal is not amortized within the allotted time. Overdue interests will affect personal social reputation and generate warnings via friend list digital identities, preventing the users from continuing to use this virtual credit.
Social reputation is based on the trust of friends. Despite the lack of a lending relationship, we believe that most people will maintain their social reputation for the benefit of continuing to use the DCUP credit financing service. This is primarily because social reputation offers a low interest rate, with acquisition and user costs far lower than that of credit financing services at traditional financial institutions. In addition, social reputation is fairly important throughout an individual’s career and workplace development. Different from typical financial credit investigation systems, social reputation-based digital identities are visible to friends in the contact lists. Once a warning is generated, it will also impact an individual’s trustworthiness in social circles.
Currently, the most prevalent mechanism for credit cards is also a type of basic social credit. However, this basic credit is not based on social circles and social communities but rather on the personal credit extension mechanisms by international membership organizations like VISA, MASTER, and other member bank institutions. In developed countries with numerous bank institutions, students and workers can easily apply for personal credit cards as long as they have a regular job. However, these credit cards are not inclusive as they are underlied by high operational and consumer costs. Stores that accept credit card payments need to pay a transaction fee of 2.5%-3.5% or more, while consumers must pay a credit card revolving interest of 14% to 30% or more, including marketing costs for other financial products. Clearly, the convenience from over three decades of credit card development comes at a high cost to society and the general public.
Bank institutions adopt the same mechanism for personal credit loan services by conducting detailed personal background checks and ratings before granting credit limits. When there is need for a cash advance or loan, users may withdraw an amount of cash within the given limit as the bank starts collecting the interest and principal according to the terms. Despite the conveniences of this traditional credit financing mechanism, they also come at a massive social cost - some of the interest is deceptively hidden in handling fees to people who desperately need credit financing.
In recent years, the development of new P2P lending platforms has not really resolved any issues because they still require institutions to conduct personal credit checks. The risk of such systems lies in a mutually unknown lending relationship. Whether the loan is provided by an individual or a third party bank-like institution, this lending risk cannot be fully eliminated and escrow funds are often misused. That is why many P2P lending companies end up with bad debts or close down due to poor management. Such inability to compete with traditional financial institutions in credit financing may even lead to other social issues, such as loan sharks and violence in debt collection.
The DCUP is short for “Decentralized Credit Union Protocol”, which is a type of basic social credit system for individuals that can create a more efficient credit trade market for everyone to extend credits to well-known friends while earning revenues on interest. Credit limits may also be extended to access convenient credit financing at any time. The credit grantor can determine the credit allocation principles, including the size and interest of a credit line for trustworthy friends. As for the credit recipient, the system will automatically start from a credit line with the lowest interest rate. In addition to enabling people to automatically close credit trade agreements through blockchain technology without relying on traditional credit rating institutions, this can also protect personal privacy and social information security. Furthermore, interest rates also become more transparent, benefiting the public through market competition.

Social Reputation System
Encompassing corporate and personal credit, social credit systems are common in developed countries. In the United States, the system operates through “credit intermediary institutions” based on the government’s supervisory regulations and management with economic benefits as the orientation. In Europe, public credit investigation institutions are led and established by the government and Central Bank, requiring corporations and people to provide data for the purposes of providing protection under the law.

Personal credit systems dominated by credit intermediary institutions inflict a high cost on society. Whether by the government or people, personal data may be easily misused. In authoritarian states, these systems have also become tools to monitor citizens.
The Social Reputation System proposed as part of the DCUP does not operate via credit intermediary institutions or save any personal data. The credits are calculated by mutual credit extensions through personal social networks, eliminating the possibility of any human intervention on the social credits of others.

DCUP Advantage

Transparent and Competitive Interest Rates

The interest rates are determined by the credit grantor. The credit applicant starts with credit lines offering the lowest interest rates. Everyone can extend credits to their trusted friends and provide credit limits at specified interest rates.

Transaction Cost

The transaction cost only involves gas fees. The DCUP will deduct a certain percentage from the interest revenue of credit grantors to ensure sustainable development of the DCUP community.

Privacy Protection

No intermediary credit rating or other third party institution is required for the protection of personal data.

Risk Control

The DCUP targets small amount credits to satisfy the economic needs of the middle class and below. The maximum credit limit for an individual will ultimately be controlled by DCUP community governance. During the initial phase of development, the social reputation for everyone will be kept within a typical credit card limit, such as a maximum credit limit between $2,000 USD and $10,000 USD, or an estimate based on the local national income and GDP criteria.
Credit grantors may have direct control of their risk tolerance. For example, staking $1,000 USD worth of Stable Coins, the extensible credit limit might be $1,000 USD. By evenly splitting $1,000 USD to 10 well-known friends, the risk of bad debt for the credit grantor is $100 USD/person.
The DCUP is decentralized in nature with a built-in risk diversification mechanism. Each friend list serves as a credit union free from the issue of central depository funds by central authorities and any systematic risks caused by massive bad debts.

No Lending Relationship

Lending relationships are replaced by social reputation combined with personal digital identities. When one or more credit grantors assign a credit limit to recipients, a personal credit pool is formed through which the sources of credit and identities of grantors remain anonymous to the recipients. When credit recipients use credit financing, they pay the principal and interest to the personal credit pool rather than the credit grantors. The normal operation of personal credit pools indicates a good social reputation, whereas overdue interest would affect such social reputation.

Self-Improvement

The DCUP is a system that continuously improves because everyone’s social circle is a mechanism for self-improvement. Social relationships are founded on trust developed from general understanding and interaction, as people would naturally steer away from friends with whom there is no shared trust.
The credit limits given by credit grantors may vary due to different levels of trust. No one would extend credits to unfamiliar friends who do not have regular employment. Moreover, personal social reputation will be reflected in social circles. When social reputation is impacted, it will not only affect the convenience of using DCUP, but also the personal social reputation in social communities.

DCUP Challenge

The Feasibility of Replacing Lending Relationships with Social Reputation

It is still unknown whether people would cherish and maintain their social reputations by paying the principal and interest on time in the same way for a credit card.

Stable Coin Acquisition and User Experience

To this day, cryptocurrencies, including the acquisition of Stable Coins, remain novel to the general public. Since the DCUP service is specially designed for the general public, a lack of experience with using Stable Coins in personal social circles may hinder DCUP development.

Establishing User Digital Identity

The DCUP system needs to prevent anyone from obtaining higher credit limits by using different IDs across different social communities. Therefore the establishment of user digital identity needs to solve this issue by adopting KYC verification methods.

Credit Grantors’ Loss and Risk Controls

Although the risk of generating bad debts is limited, any losses to credit grantors will definitely affect the credibility of the DCUP, and influence the willingness of new users to extend credit to their social circles. Hence it is necessary to compensate credit grantors by proposing better risk control methods. Some examples of better compensatory measures in breach of contract include appropriating a percentage to the insurance pool or reselling credit debts to other financial institutions.

Use Case Sequence Diagram - Credit Flow
Explanation: Alice has two close friends in her friend list: Bob and Eve. Alice deposits 100 USDT into DCUP for staking, and withdraws an equal amount of 100u Credit Points. Alice gives 50u Credits to Bob and Eve respectively. Now Bob and Eve each have 50u of Virtual Credits.
When Bob and Eve use Virtual Credits and exchange 50u for USDT, they must deposit 50u in USDT within the allotted period (just like credit cards) or they need to pay the revolving interest to the DCUP. Bob and Eve choose not to return the 50u for the time being and pay the revolving interest. Hence Alice receives the interest from the DCUP.

Use Case Sequence Diagram - My credit limit from social network
Explanation: Alice, Bob, and Eve are close friends. Alice deposits 100 USDT into DCUP for staking, and withdraws an equal amount of 100u Credit Points. Alice gives 50u Credits to Bob and Eve, respectively.
Bob deposits 200 USDT into DCUP for staking, and withdraws an equal amount of 200u Credit Points. Bob gives 150u to Alice and 50u to Eve.
Eve deposits 100 USD into DCUP for staking, and withdraws an equal amount of 100u Credit Points. Eve gives 50u to Alice and 50u to Bob.
Alice’s credit limit from social network = 200u
Bob’s credit limit from social network = 100u
Eve’s credit limit from social network = 100u

credit_limit810×822 39.8 KB


Credit Limit
Since the available credit limit for each person is determined by his or her social circle, the varying sizes of personal social circles lead to different levels of credit limits. To stabilize everyone’s credit limit and prevent it from fluctuating due to changes by credit grantors, the DCUP system adopts two types of measures.

A Fixed Upper Limit

No matter how many friends a person has, the available credit limit is fixed at a total amount between $2,000 USD and a maximum upper limit of $10,000 USD—just like the limit of a credit card. In the future, this credit can be determined by community governance with varying upper limits based on national GDPs.
For example, Bob’s credit from social circles amounts to 20,000 USDT. The credit has an upper limit of 10,000 USDT, hence Bob is only entitled to use 10,000 USDT for both consumption and cash advance in reality.

Staking Lock-Out Period

When credit grantors stake USDT to the DCUP for credit points and extend credits to the friends in their social circles, there is a lock out period of at least 3-6 months. During this period, credit points cannot be withdrawn in order to maintain credit limit stability.
As an example, Alice gives Bob 1000u Credit Points (equal to 1000 USDT). Perhaps Bob does not use the credits and Alice finds the revenue to be not as expected. She wants to withdraw the 1000u credit limit and give it to Eve instead. Due to the restraint of the staking lock-out period, Alice must wait for three months before she can withdraw the credit.

Conclusion
Since everyone’s basic social credit can be established on top of social community frameworks, we believe there is still a large room for the development of Social Finance. Today, small personal trusts can be established at low costs through smart contracts. Based on individuals, small-scale bank services can now achieve what could not be imagined in the past. Indeed, personal credit financing is an application full of great potential.
To rectify the shortcomings of traditional credit cards, we offer personal virtual credits through the DCUP, which is not only more reasonable and effective, but can also be settled instantly. This proposal is applicable to any country regardless of the prevalence of existing financial services. To advanced countries with high levels of credit card debt, this proposal becomes an alternative solution for social communities to resolve these debts. Through the spread of social software, the DCUP would be able to quickly penetrate the market, establish social reputations, and realize a future for decentralized financial services.",27,240.4,2021-10-19

['Add Fireblocks as a whitelister on Aave Arc'],"Add Fireblocks as a whitelister on Aave Arc
Summary
Fireblocks asks the Aave Governance community to approve the appointment, adoption, and authorization of Fireblocks LLC, a Fireblocks company, as a “whitelister” for one or more deployments of Aave Arc.
Proposal
Fireblocks is on a mission to bring more institutional participants into DeFi.
Today, Fireblocks serves more than 600 customers and has secured over $1.25 trillion in digital assets.  Fireblocks’ technology has become trusted by the leading institutional crypto players and the world’s biggest banks to secure digital assets, develop new yield generating strategies, and improve capital efficiency. As the initial whitelisting partner for Aave Arc, Fireblocks can offer institutions the same secure and scalable rails used to transfer and store digital assets to access permissioned DeFi environments.
DeFi is considered by institutional users to be one of the more complex markets to navigate across security, compliance, and risk perspectives. We are eager to be at the forefront of this transformational opportunity with Aave Arc by extending access to even our most compliance-conscious customers, who would otherwise avoid DeFi over compliance or regulatory concerns.
Fireblocks’ R&D, compliance, and legal teams have developed a new whitelister framework for permissioned DeFi. This framework meets both enterprise-grade requirements for accessing DeFi and adheres to Aave Arc’s whitelister governance criteria. This deployment will set the precedent for new organizations joining Aave Arc, simplify the process for onboarding new whitelisters, and ensure everyone is following best practices defined by the whitelister community.
Detailed Description of Proposal
Aave Arc is a “permissioned” version of the software underlying V2 of the Aave protocol that employs an additional smart contract layer to only allow “whitelisted” or “permissioned” users to engage with the protocol.
Each Aave Arc deployment will launch with one or more “whitelister.”  Only regulated entities that (a) employ KYC/KYB principles in accordance with FATF guidelines to identify and accept their clients; (b) have robust AML/CFT compliance programs; and (c) are currently in good standing with an active license/registration in the entity’s operating jurisdiction will be accepted as “whitelisters” on deployments of the Aave Arc.
“Whitelisting” is the gatekeeping function performed by whitelisters on users of Aave Arc.  The term refers specifically to the process of:

Conducting KYC/KYB checks on the user;
Onboarding the user with appropriate disclosures, terms, and conditions; and,
Granting specific permissions (e.g., borrow, supply, liquidate) to the Ethereum wallet address(es) provided by the user.

Aave Arc whitelisters are granted “guardian” status like the Aave protocol V2 guardian role with the ability to collectively, make and enforce decisions around gatekeeping parameters.  This will enable whitelisters to establish and revise, as necessary, whitelisting standards for deployments of Aave Arc to ensure that they remain current with regulatory requirements and the needs of users.
Approving one or more whitelisters is a crucial step towards establishing a permissioned deployment of the Aave protocol that meets the requirements of institutional users that may be otherwise unable to participate in the Aave protocol.  The Aave arc community is being asked to evaluate and vote on whether Fireblocks LLC should be approved as such a whitelister and begin the process of whitelisting users of an Aave Arc deployment.
We believe that Fireblocks LLC, a Fireblocks company, satisfies all the qualification requirements to be a whitelister.  We have performed a detailed analysis and documented it here for the consideration of the Aave Governance community.
Approval of Fireblocks LLC can potentially also facilitate the integration of other “whitelisters” and institutions into instances of the Aave protocol.  This may have multiple benefits, including the creation of sustainable governance practices for Aave Arc whitelisters and whitelister customers, as well as the enablement of benefits to the ecosystem, such as the onboarding of regulated fiat on/off ramps and protocol deployments connected to debit cards, high yield savings accounts and other innovative fintech products.
Next Steps
Aave Governance community to vote YES/NO for the appointment and authorization of a Fireblocks company to the role of “whitelister” in one or more permissioned deployments of the Aave protocol.
Deployment of the Aave protocol and the commencement of onboarding institutional users through the “whitelisting” process adopted by approved whitelisters.

Fireblocks: Qualifications to be a Whitelister
Requirements of a Whitelister:
Only regulated entities that (a) employ KYC/KYB principles in accordance with FATF guidelines to identify and accept their clients; (b) have robust AML/CFT compliance programs; and (c) are currently in good standing with an active license/registration in the entity’s operating jurisdiction will be accepted as “whitelisters” on deployments of the Aave Arc.
Fireblocks LLC is qualified to be a whitelister for Aave Arc because: (a) a licensed/registered entity in its operating jurisdiction; (b) subject to KYC/KYB principles in accordance with FATF guidelines; and (c) required to adopt, and has adopted, a robust AML/CFT compliance program.   This section progresses by addressing each required elements in turn and concludes that Fireblocks LLC is qualified to perform the services of a whitelister.
Fireblocks LLC is a registered “money services business” in good standing with FinCEN and licensed to offer money transmission services in one or more of the 50 United States.
Fireblocks LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, (the “Company”) was formed in October 2020 for the purpose of providing certain money transmission services in conjunction with, and as a complement to, the “software as a service” (“SaaS”) business operated by the Company’s direct and indirect owners, Fireblocks, Inc. and Fireblocks Ltd., respectively.  On April 13, 2021, Fireblocks LLC registered as a “money services business” (“MSB”) with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”), the U.S. federal regulatory agency responsible for administering and enforcing U.S. anti-money laundering (“AML”) and counter financing of terrorism (“CFT”) laws for “financial institutions,” a category that includes MSB.  The Company’s MSB registration is in good standing (registration #31000187180862), and Company will maintain that registration in accordance with 31 CFR 1022.380 renewal requirements at the end of every two (2) years.
In addition to the foregoing, various U.S. jurisdictions require licensure for the Company to offer certain services, often under applicable “money transmitter” statutes.  Fireblocks LLC has obtained, and is in the process of obtaining, state Money Transmission Licenses (“MTLs”), as required by each state statute based on the activity the Company intends to conduct (if any) in each state (NMLS ID: 2066055).  The Company’s plans for pursuing MTLs vary by jurisdiction and are subject to change.  Please refer to FinCEN’s MSB registry for additional information on the MTL activities of Fireblocks LLC.
Fireblocks LLC is subject to KYC/KYB principles that are in accordance with FATF guidelines.

Fireblocks LLC is subject to KYC/KYB Principles

The Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) is the cornerstone of the United States’ money laundering control system. The USA PATRIOT Act amended the BSA by strengthening its AML and CFT monitoring requirements for financial institutions.  As amended, the BSA requires, among other things, that financial institutions implement a risk-based compliance program with at least the following four components: (1) designation of a responsible person; (2) development and adoption of internal policies, procedures and controls, including “know your customer” (“KYC”) / “know your business” (“KYB”) identification requirements; (3) training of relevant employees; and, (4) independent testing to review of the efficacy of the compliance program.
FinCEN administers the BSA and issues and enforces compliance program regulations for financial institutions, including MSBs.  On May 11, 2016, FinCEN published its final Customer Due Diligence requirements (the “CDD Rule”) and amended the Bank Secrecy Act regulations to clarify and strengthen customer due diligence requirements for covered financial institutions. The CDD Rule imposed explicit ongoing customer due diligence and monitoring requirements and introduced a new requirement for financial institutions to identify and verify the identity of beneficial owners of legal entity customers, subject to certain exclusions and exemptions.  Arguably, the CDD Rule amounted to the addition of a fifth compliance program requirement in the form of risk-based procedures for conducting ongoing customer due diligence in addition to point-in-time diligence at onboarding.
In addition to federal and state CFT/AML regulations, the Company is required to comply with Office of Foreign Asset Control (“OFAC”) sanctions programs.  OFAC is the arm of the U.S. Department of the Treasury that administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign countries and regimes, terrorists, international narcotics traffickers, those engaged in activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and other threats to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States.  OFAC acts under Presidential national emergency powers, as well as authority granted by specific statutes, to impose controls on transactions and freeze assets under U.S. jurisdiction. U.S. persons must comply with OFAC regulations, including all persons and entities within the United States and all U.S. incorporated entities.

The KYC/KYB Principles to which Fireblocks LLC is Subject are FATF Compliant

The United States is one of 39 countries that are members of the Financial Action Task Force (“FATF”).  FATF is an inter-governmental body that sets international standards to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing.  As a member country, the United States is part of a core group committed to the dissemination of global standards on AML/CFT best practices (“FATF Recommendations”) and their implementation through legislative and regulatory reform.  In addition to setting standards, FATF monitors countries to ensure that they implement FATF Recommendations fully and effectively and holds countries that do not comply to account.
In FATF’s most recent evaluation report on the United States, adopted in March 2020, FATF favorably noted FinCEN’s adoption of the CDD Rule, including its requirements for legal entity beneficial owner verification and ongoing customer due diligence and monitoring.  In recognition of the United States’ progress in strengthening its measures to fight money laundering and terrorist financing, FATF upgraded their rating of the United States’ KYC/KYB standards for identifying customers.  In sum, FATF rated the United States as compliant, largely complaint, or partially compliant with 36 out of 40 FATF Recommendations.  In its August 11, 2021, consolidated assessment of ratings, FATF evaluated the United States as being moderately to highly effective at combating money laundering and terrorism financing in 10 of 11 assessment categories.
Fireblocks LLC has a robust AML/CFT compliance program.
Fireblocks LLC has implemented a robust compliance program with policies and procedures that are risk-based and reasonably designed to comply with Fireblocks’ obligations under the U.S. anti-money laundering statutes as well as applicable sanctions programs. The formal compliance program adopted by the Company consists of five key components: (1) the appointment of a qualified BSA/AML Officer; (2) written compliance policies and procedures, including an AML program manual and risk assessment; (3) external audit and internal testing; (4) a risk-based customer identification and due diligence program; and (5) training appropriate to each employee, officer, and director (the “Compliance Program”). All potential Fireblocks LLC account holders are required to meet or exceed the minimum requirements of the Compliance Program at account opening and on an ongoing basis to access services provided by Fireblocks LLC.

Appointment of a Qualified BSA/AML Officer

Fireblocks LLC appointed Peter Singer as the BSA/AML Officer for the Company.  Prior to joining the Company, Mr. Singer served in multiple senior and executive compliance roles, including as Chief Compliance Officer, in the cryptocurrency, payments, and fintech industries.  In these roles, Mr. Singer was responsible for ensuring that these companies adhered to state and federal regulations for MSBs and implemented strong controls to prevent fraud and financial crimes.  Mr. Singer holds the Certified Anti Money Laundering Specialist certification (CAMS) and the Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE) designation.

Written Compliance Policies and Procedures

Fireblocks LLC has adopted a comprehensive Compliance Program in writing.  The written Compliance Program is commensurate with the nature and volume of services provided by the Company and incorporates policies, procedures and internal controls reasonably designed to assure compliance with applicable law, including procedures for:

Collecting and verifying customer identity, including for legal entity customers and their beneficial owners;
Performing enhanced due diligence and ongoing monitoring;
PEP screening;
Monitoring for suspicious activity;
Filing reports, including reports of suspicious activity and unresolved “red flags”;
Creating and retaining records;
Training of appropriate personnel;
Sanctions screening; and
Responding to law enforcement requests.

The BSA/AML Officer is responsible for ensuring that the Compliance Program is updated as frequently as necessary to reflect the requirements of law, regulation, and guidance and, in any event, that it is re-evaluated at least once annually in connection with the Company’s risk assessment process.

External Audit and Internal Testing

The Company is required to perform an independent review of the Compliance Program to assess its adequacy.  The Company will engage a qualified individual or firm to complete such a review no later than the first anniversary of its registration as a MSB, as is commensurate with the risk of the services it offers.

Risk-Based Customer Identification and Due Diligence Program

As discussed above, the Company has adopted a written Compliance Program that includes, among other things, customer due diligence procedures that require the collection of information sufficient to verify the identity of the customer and, in the case of legal entities, their authorized representatives and beneficial owner(s). In cases where the initial diligence process uncovers “red flags,” the Compliance Department is required to perform enhanced due diligence on the customer, which may include additional research or requests for information, or any other steps that the Compliance Department deems necessary.  In addition to the diligence performed at account opening, all customers are subject to ongoing monitoring requirements, which may be event driven or periodic and, in any case, are determined and implemented on a risk basis.
Training
The BSA/AML Officer is responsible for ensuring the education and/or training of appropriate personnel concerning their responsibilities under the Compliance Program, including training in the detection of suspicious transactions.  The BSA/AML Officer will conduct or will engage a qualified individual or firm to conduct, such trainings no later than the first anniversary of the Company’s registration as an MSB.
Conclusion:  Fireblocks LLC is Qualified to be a Whitelister for Aave Arc
Based on the foregoing, Fireblocks LLC is qualified to perform the following functions a whitelister for Aave Arc:

Conducting initial KYC/KYB checks on any potential users of Aave Arc;
Maintaining KYC and customer due diligence documentation for such users to ensure continued compliance; and
Conducting any other necessary compliance checks as required by (i) the jurisdiction for a particular deployment of Aave Arc; or (ii) the standard operating procedures that whitelisters employ.

Question1: If Company A (uses Fireblocks) has a customer who deposits $50m USDC into the USDC Aave Arc Pool. Who is the KYC performed on? Company A or the Customer of Company A? If the later, is company A sharing KYC details to Fireblocks to perform the required AML/KYC checks?

Summary
Lido allows users to earn staking rewards on the Ethereum beacon chain without locking Ether or maintaining staking infrastructure. This is done through the stETH token. stETH tokens represent a tokenized staking deposit and can be held, traded, or sold.

Motivation
There is strong interest in using stETH to earn additional yield without taking a lot of risk. This is evident through the growth of the stETH/ETH pool on Curve Finance, which has become the most liquid pool on Curve with a liquidity of $3.8 billion.
The addition of stETH on to Aave can work to attract a larger audience to both Aave and Lido. More ETH staked with Lido would subsequently benefit the decentralization and security of the Ethereum network, to the benefit of the community as a whole. stETH would likely bring new borrow demand to Aave as market participants look to borrow against their staked ETH or lend their stETH for a yield.
We want people who want to be responsibly long ETH (i.e. via taking leverage on AAVE) to be able to put some extra staking rewards on top.

Specifications


What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?
Jacob (jbeezy) is a full time member of the DAO working to facilitate integrations for st-Assets across defi in protocols such as Aave among others.


Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token
Lido Background
The Lido Protocol, built on Ethereum’s beacon chain to start, allows users to earn staking rewards on the beacon chain without locking Ether or maintaining staking infrastructure.
Lido was announced in November 2020. The testnet was released in late November.
Lido today has 3 products (stETH, stSOL, bLuna) managed by 4 teams in separate organizations.  Across these products is a multi billion dollar TVL and has pushed Lido to #8 on DeFi Llama rankings. stETH has also been accepted as part of Nexus Mutual’s treasury as part of their risk management strategy.
Lido has begun the process to move over to a fully non-custodial solution. Details can be found here: Withdrawal Credentials in Lido
Lido manages the liquid staking protocol by deciding on key parameters (e.g. setting fees, assigning node operators and oracles) through the voting power of governance token holders.
Lido has been audited by Sigma Prime, Quantstamp and MixBytes.
stETH Background
Lido allows users to deposit ETH and receive stETH. The deposited ETH is then pooled and staked with node operators selected by the Lido DAO. stETH represents the user’s staked ETH balance of the beacon chain along with staking rewards accrued or penalties inflicted on validators in the beacon chain. When transactions are enabled on the beacon chain, stETH can be redeemed for unstaked ETH and accumulated rewards.
Unlike beacon chain ETH, stETH can be freely transferred and traded. Onboarding stETH to Aave would allow users to lend and borrow against stETH.
stETH tokens represent a tokenized staking deposit. stETH tokens can be held, traded, or sold. The balance of stETH is based on the total amount of staked ETH plus total staking rewards minus slashing applied on validators. stETH rebases daily.
The stETH supply stands at 1,274,802 - worth $4.2BN using current stETH prices.


Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?
stETH as DeFi collateral is beneficial for a number of reasons.

stETH is almost as safe as ETH, price-wise: barring catastrophic scenarios, its value tends to hold the ETH peg well;
stETH is a productive asset. Earning rewards on collateral effectively lowers the cost of borrowing. This could make borrowing more attractive on Aave and help to increase market utilization (and therefore Aave’s protocol revenue from stablecoin reserve factors).
stETH is a very liquid asset with over $3.8 billion in liquidity locked in the Curve stETH/ETH pool.



Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are the live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?
Lido protocol background is listed in Question #2.
There is a DAO and it is live. The Lido DAO consists of, amongst others, Semantic VC, ParaFi Capital, Libertus Capital, Terra, Bitscale Capital, StakeFish, StakingFacilities, Chorus, P2P Capital and KR1, Stani Kulechov of Aave, Banteg of Yearn, Will Harborne of Deversifi, Julien Bouteloup of Stake Capital and Kain Warwick of Synthetix.
The Lido treasury has been recently diversified and DAO members now include Paradigm, Three Arrows Capital, DeFiance Capital, Jump Trading, Alameda Research, iFinex, Dragonfly Capital, Delphi Digital, Robot Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, Digital Currency Group, The LAO and angels.
The Lido suite of products consist of st-assets which represent the underlying staked collateral on various protocols.  Currently this is stETH, bLuna and stSOL and is managed by 4 teams in separate organizations to further mitigate centralization risk.
There are further wrapped versions to address platform limitations around rebasing assets or bridging to other ecosystem. These wrapped assets are minted/burned based on locking of the st-asset. Currently there is wstETH (non-rebasing) and bETH (Terra representation of stETH).
Early challenges were overcome with DAO member support, speed of execution and utility of st-assets. The last one is particularly critical in the success of any liquid product.


How is the asset currently used?
stETH as DeFi collateral is used in a number of ways.

a productive asset (e.g. in Nexus Mutual Treasury risk management strategy);
compounding yield strategies in DeFI (AMM, autofarms, soon Lending ) (e.g. Convex, Yearn, Harvest);
multichain lending (e.g. bETH on Terra in Anchor);



Emission schedule
There is no emission schedule. Similar to DAI, stETH is minted on demand when users lock ETH into the protocol.


Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?

Counterparty risks

Lido relies on a set of oracles to report staking rewards to the smart contracts. Their maximum possible impact is limited by the recent upgrade (limit oracles report change by 10% APR increase in stake and 5% decrease in stake), and the operators of oracles are all well-known entities: Stakefish, Certus One, Chorus, Staking Facilities, and P2P.
Read further in Lido documentation.

The roles and addresses can be checked in the Aragon UI https://mainnet.lido.fi/#/lido-dao/permissions/app/0xae7ab96520de3a18e5e111b5eaab095312d7fe84

Staking risks

stETH faces staking risks, specifically validator risks including slashing and hostage risks. To mitigate these, Lido works only with best-in-class validators with a track record of success.

Withdrawal risks

To mitigate withdrawal risks, Lido staking went live on December 18th through a withdrawal key ceremony. Chorus One, Staking Facilities, Certus One, Argent, Banteg (yearn.finance), Alex Svanevik (Nansen), Anton Bukov (1inch), Michael Egorov (Curve/Nucypher), Rune Christensen (MakerDAO), Will Harborne (DeversiFi), and Mustafa Al-Bassam (LazyLedger) came together over a four-day event to generate threshold signatures for Lido’s withdrawal keys in a secure environment on air-gapped machines. Lido has already migrated to a non-custodial solution and >50% of all stETH already uses this. Details can be found here: Withdrawal Credentials in Lido

Price feed risk

The Beacon chain oracle has “sanity checks” on both max APR reported (no more than 10%) and total staked amount drop (no more than 5%). The oracle is run by highly respected node operators. The Beacon oracle has no interaction with the ChainLink price feeds.

The past couple weeks has seen the stETH/ETH peg slip ~2% and since recover partially.  The reasons for the slip were twofold.


The referral program was being abused and resulting in one-sided liquidity additions to the primary curve pool. This is being addressed with the whitelist proposal here: Switch Referral Program to Whitelist Mode


There were some recent projects that have been offering high APR on native ETH and the liquidity swarm removed ETH out of the curve pool as well (similar to one sided staking). These have already decayed drastically as the rewards have turned off and will take a week or two to distribute back to the ecosystem. A portion of that is likely to flow back into the curve pool.


Recovery of the peg since then was swift:

Risk Assessment

ratings2026×258 41.9 KB


Proposed Risk Parameters
These have been modified a bit since the last proposal. The reasons are described below. Generally, the functions of stETH have held consistent during growth and market volatility.

LTV: 70%
Liquidation Threshold: 75%
Liquidation Bonus: 7.5%
Reserve Factor: 10%

A LTV of 70% is higher than the 56% average LTV across non-stablecoin assets and 10% lower than ETH’s 80% LTV. This gives the protocol more room to safely liquidate stETH with a volatility profile similar to ETH.
Interest Rate Model:
UOptimal: 60%
Base: 0%
Slope 1: 8%
Slope 2: 200%
As stETH is more suited as collateral instead of a borrowing asset we adjusted the utilization rate to 60% and doubled slope 2 in order to safe guard enough liquidity in the event of market consolidation and liquidation events.
stETH liquidity and risk considerations

stETH inherits all of ETH’s market risk, so they should be considered together for the purpose of evaluating market risk
stETH value is defined and backed by the value of Ether and expectations on the beacon chain withdrawals timeline. As the expected merge gets closer, stETH risk will drop down significantly.
stETH is one of the most liquid tokens in crypto with low exchange volumes and extremely high liquidity
stETH liquidity is ensured by Lido’s strategy incentivizing a consistent stETH peg

We will open a snapshot after ~5 days to allow for community feedback.
Thank you.",41,1403.2,2021-10-18
['ARC: Add support for stETH (Lido)'],"I think the Risk Parameters are reasonable as initial values and that it is right to have the LTV allowing some extra (10%pts) on the ETH LTV of 80%. Also these numbers are aligned with the WBTC risk parameters.
Assuming stETH is adopted then I think we should monitor for any further downwards divergence from the ETH price in future and maybe revisit the risk parameters if needed in later reviews",29,40.8,2021-10-04
['ARC: Add support for stETH (Lido)'],"Regarding smart-contract risk, some considerations could be added. E.g. lido strongly depends on Aragon’s battle proof codebase, which has been audited several times (Aragon - Blockchain Security DB) and has implemented various security measures ($350M TVL, $250k bug bounty program GitHub - aragon/aragonOS: (Aragon 1) Reference implementation for aragonOS: a Solidity framework for building complex dApps and protocols). The “D” maturity level could be somewhat too punishing.",29,40.8,2021-10-04
['ARC: Add support for stETH (Lido)'],"In the interest of transparency, we (Lido) wanted to notify the AAVE community about a recent vulnerability that was discovered. On Oct 5, 2021, a vulnerability was reported via the Lido bug bounty program on Immunefi by an anonymous whitehat (who later turned out to be Dmitri Tsumak, the founder of Stakewise). The vulnerability could only be exploited by a whitelisted node operator and potentially allowed stealing a small share of user funds.
It is currently mitigated, no funds are at risk, and a long-term solution is under development.
We will provide further updates regarding the vulnerability nature and the proposed long-term mitigations for the Lido protocol as soon as all affected protocols and services implement their mitigations and green light the disclosure.
In light of this we have temporarily postponed the snapshot vote until we can close the loop on this.",21,49.2,2021-10-06
['ARC: Add support for stETH (Lido)'],"Contrary to other productive tokens already supported by Aave (like xSUSHI), stETH’s productivity comes in the form of rebasing as you mentioned (staking yield is expressed as a growing balance of stETH instead of as a growing value per token)

How would a rebasing token work in lending and borrowing?
Case 1
A borrower of 1 stETH via Aave would be liable to pay back:

The 1 stETH + the interest accrued from the borrowing itself (plus incentives);
OR
The 1 stETH + the interest accrued from the borrowing + incentives + the stETH yield in the form of rebased balance?

Case 2
(Same thought as above)
A depositor of 1 stETH in Aave is entitled to:

The 1 stETH + the interest accrued from the lending (plus incentives);
OR
The 1 stETH + the interest accrued from lending + incentives + the stETH yield in the form of rebased balance?

Following the normal contract structures that are in place for other assets in Aave, would it be option 1 for both cases (1 and 2).
In this scenario, the borrower of stETH would receive the staking yield and the stETH depositor would only deposit if the deposit APY was greater than lido’s staking APY.
@jbeezy is the proposal to add stETH to Aave under options 1 ou 2 for each case? Would the choice of option 2 require a significant amount of changes to the existing Aave contracts used for the other assets?

Case 3
[Only in case the proposal is to add stETH to Aave without taking into consideration it is a rebasing, productive token - i.e. opting for option 1 in case 1 and case 2]:
Since positions are overcollateralized, in every Aave market there is a higher balance of deposited tokens (market size) than borrowed tokens (total borrowed).
How would stETH’s staking yield of the difference work in these cases (the yield in the form of rebasing of the amount of tokens corresponding to market size - total borrowed)?",13,57.6,2021-10-15
['ARC: Add support for stETH (Lido)'],"We are opting to launch without borrowing of stETH initially.  We will make a decision after some initial data on whether borrowing should be activated. We expect stETH, similar to ETH to have a very small borrowing market.
Case 1 – given we enable borrowing:
It would be option 1, meaning if the user has borrowed 1 stETH they have to pay back 1 stETH + interest rate, and get to keep the stETH yield.
Case 2 - again, given that borrowing is on:
It is option 2, except only the token representing the ‘unborrowed’ stETH in the lending pool rebases.
Option 2 in the second case involves significant changes to the AAVE debtToken, and it is very similar to ones made previously by AMPL.",6,36.2,2021-10-18

Please provide any additional feedback during this period if there is any.",6,6.2,2021-10-18
['ARC: Add support for stETH (Lido)'],"I disagree with Option 2. Even though the rebase rate is fairly predictable and minimal, I think that treating the borrowed asset differently from the lending asset is fundamentally incompatible with the AAVE lending market. The AMPL market’s volatility around rebases is not something to aspire to imo. This is not a desirable market for organic lenders and borrowers. Most borrowers are simply arbitraging the rebase, and borrowing simply drops close to zero when negative rebases are expected.
Option 2 actually would not require significant changes to the AAVE debt token. In fact, AFAIK, there are no changes to the debt token at all, and the standard debt token contract is used for AMPL. Only the aToken implementation is altered to rebase, so this in effect makes option 2 happen. Option 1 would require altering both the debt token and aToken implementation to rebase if I’m correct about how the AMPL contracts function.",5,11.0,2021-10-18

['ARC: Fix UI bugs in reserve overview for AMPL'],"The UI of the reserve overview for AMPL shows some misleading things. This ARC collates such misleading things.
Misleading information can cause borrowers and lenders to make mistakes.
Here is one such misleading thing. In the top right corner, the utilization rate graph shows 32%. However, in the middle, the utilization rate pie chart shows 49%.

image1804×802 101 KB

Checking a second source for the utilization rate (the number of tokens here as compared to the number of tokens here) confirms that the utilization rate is 49%. This suggests that the utilization rate graph is misleading.",15,38.0,2021-10-13
['ARC: Fix UI bugs in reserve overview for AMPL'],"The graph lags behind, because it is only updated a few times a day, or so it seems (four data points per day, if I’m not mistaken). The graphs in themselves are - to say it mildly - not up to the standards of the otherwise quite solid UI. They’re not really precise nor do they give a lot of information. And in the case of AMPL, as you can see, the spike to 550% APY makes the whole chart unusable for the foreseeable future.
I don’t see the need for this to be fixed, to be honest. The raw numbers are there and one should always look at the raw numbers, not the charts.
But hopefully, V3 might have better tools when it comes to visualization of rates (and maybe not just a tease concerning the 30D averages - always bugged me that they’re never filled in ;)).",12,27.4,2021-10-13

Fair enough, this explains why the graph does not show the 100% borrow rates we have during rebase.
However, it does not explain this: for more than 2 days now, the graphed utilization rate still shows ~32%, yet the actual utilization rate has been sitting at 49%.

As described here, the quoted and actual rates diverge exponentially as it gets above 10%. This exists on every market so it’s not AMPL specific, but AMPL is uniquely exposed because the interest rate is very high at the top end of utilization.
Right now, users need to look up the utilization rate in this table, curve #1, to know the applied rate.
I don’t know if this is directly within the scope of Aave governance since it can only be addressed in the frontend. However, it should be looked at as soon as possible by the maintainers.",8,41.6,2021-10-15

There are multiple issues with the utilization though:

the data is based on thegraph an apparently for AMPL (at least)the utilization data is completely broken. Currently utilization is ~85%, and the graph shows sth around ~ 56% https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/aave/protocol-v2?selected=playground
There are even data-points where the utilization for AMPL is negative.

while deposit/ variable apy are based on accrued index calculation and therefore should be pretty accurate, the utilization on the other hand is just a snapshot taken every 5min (ignoring what happens in between) - didn’t do the math, but can’t imagine this has a huge impact aave-api/RatesHistory.ts at master · aave/aave-api · GitHub

AIP-39: Risk Parameter Updates for Aave V2 assets

Passed with 331.5k AAVE Yae (100.0%)


On average Gauntlet’s recommendations have shown a 14% reduction in VaR. Our simulations show an average of 0.2% of Aave’s TVL being at risk on any given day. In the scenario where volatility reaches similar levels as Black Thursday, we expect to save Aave protocol users an average of $5,258,511 in liquidations.
From our first liquidation bonus updates (2021-08-27) to present Gauntlet has saved Aave protocol users $188,253 in liquidations as a direct impact of lower liquidation bonuses, which equates to $1,493,747 on an annualized basis. It is important to note that this time frame experienced relatively low levels of asset volatility.
Separately, the Risk DAO is starting to take shape. Currently, Gauntlet is working within Aave’s existing governance framework and thus AIPs are implemented roughly a week after its corresponding ARC is published. As the community has probably noticed, Gauntlet’s ARCs are back to back to the previous week’s AIP execution.

['ARC: Institute a Voting Delay Period'],"
Simple Summary
A proposal to increase the voting delay period for all on-chain governance proposals (AIPs).

Background
Aave governance proposals (AIPs) vary in complexity, scope, and impact. As Aave  continues to make progress on its growth trajectory, it is becoming obvious that certain proposals need to allow more time for pre-vote analysis. For instance, AIP-33: Add FEI to Aave V2 was, fortunately, able to be canceled, via delegation removal, rather than needing to use the Aave Guardian.

This month has seen the most governance proposals (9) of any month since Aave V2 has launched with no sign of slowing given the variety of authors and proposal type.

Proposal
A formal analysis period is defined as a non-voting period where a proposal is active (e.g. submitted on-chain). Currently, the votingDelay configured on Aave governance is set to 0 - voting begins immediately when proposals are created.

We propose to set this voting delay to 2 days, in seconds, using the setVotingDelay method on the core governance contract. Setting the votingDelay will cause there to be a new review period between the proposal submission and when voting for that proposal begins.
We encourage the community to chime in via comments below but should mention there is precedent for this in Compound (see Governance Analysis Period proposal).

Potential Side Effects

The Guardian is marginally more likely to be needed should time sensitive issues arise.
Gauntlet’s risk parameterization will see a delay from time to identifying a suboptimal risk parameter to executing a change. At least until a riskAdmin role is implemented.


Next Steps

['ARC : When profits sharing?'],"Hi all,
If I come to you today, it is to talk about the treasury of the Aave protocol.
The various Liquidity Mining programs on Polygon, Ethereum and now Avax have significantly helped to increase the TVL on the protocol as well as the funds raised on the treasury contract (Aave: Aave Collector V2 | 0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c)
It cannot be denied that this is a good thing, but it comes at a cost for the protocol concerning the LM on Ethereum. A little too expensive since already nearly a third of the reserve ecosystem has been spent between the LM and stacker rewards (SM and aBPT).
Of course, the part of this sum distributed to reward the Safety Module stackers is a good expense, but the sums collected on the treasury contract are not sufficient to ensure total autonomy of the protocol in the short term.
If we compare the sums spent on LM for incentives which are in the order of several hundred of thousand Aave, these grants are awfully expensive.
According to my estimates and the various discussions I have had on this subject, if we arrive at a minimum treasury of $ 50 million for the protocol, the returns generated by the work of this treasury should be able to make the protocol financially self-sufficient.
Today, we are still far from those 50 millions (~ 17 millions at the moment) and the ecosystem reserve is emptying at great speed. (I have already addressed the LM’s concerns with Aave as rewards and the concentration of these incentives in Aave in few hands as well as the selling pressure on the token price that this induces …)
This is why I would like us to have a more in-depth reflection on how to quickly get to a minimum of 50 million stablecoins in the protocol treasury.
There are several solutions I am sure, and I will suggest one but that is obviously not the only possibility.
Can we imagine creating bonds worth at least $ 35 million?
The funds thus collected would be paid directly into the protocol treasury.
These bonds would be NFTs (erc 721) allowing to instantly redeem the same amount plus a bonus payable in Aave by the reserve ecosystem (Aave: Ecosystem Reserve | 0x25f2226b597e8f9514b3f68f00f494cf4f286491), we can imagine 15% of incentives by example, once the fee distribution mechanism has been fully operationnal.
The participant would deposit an amount directly in stablecoins on the treasury contract and in return would receive a redeemable NFT in Aave from the ecosystem reserve.
We could, once the fundraising is over, do the job to activate the distribution of fees return for the holders of Aave and start to share the revenues of the protocol between Aave holders (even if these were to be quite reduced, it is a matter of principle and direction.)
By putting in place a system allowing the protocol autonomy to be achieved as quickly as possible, we would not only gain credibility and traction, but also, we would reduce the risk of seeing Geist.finance-type competition eating away at our TVL.
In addition, the amount of just over 30 million needed does not appear unrealistic when you consider the number of Aave to be distributed in exchange.
Here I have exposed my thoughts on the subject and although I am sure that it remains incomplete and perfectible, I hope that it will have the advantage of triggering a reflection on a problem which begins to persist in what concerns the remuneration of Aave holders for the direct operation of the protocol.
Thanks for reading me.",46,1298.8,2021-10-09
['ARC : When profits sharing?'],"Definitely something on what I agree thinking power needs to start moving @EmmanuelD .
In addition to the treasury contract you point to on Ethereum mainnet, the Aave treasury on Polygon also holds ~$5.8m and Avalanche’s even if just launched is approaching $100k.
I would say there are 3 good initial steps to proceed with, before entering into more advance models like the one you propose:


Put all non Aave-deposited assets to work. Some funds on the treasury on mainnet, because on how they get collected are still not aTokens (~$400k), which means losing a meaningful  profit, so at least they should just be periodically re-deposited on v2 until the source of revenue (mainly v1) is not important.

Put all assets to work in the most efficient way. Aave is by principles a welcoming ecosystem, really risk aware, but trying to find synergies with strong projects out there. At the moment, it’s clear that at least would be worth it to consider using aTokens of the Aave treasury (or even underlying) in other platforms. This usage can be considered in a broad way: simply provide liquidity, participating in voting dynamics, etc. Even more than just the pure “profit” aspects, in a lot of cases out there, providing liquidity implies getting governance tokens, and the Aave ecosystem should have a say on those systems.

Claim rewards on the Aave treasury. At the moment, just by depositing on Aave on all networks, the treasury has multiple pending claims, which could be re-invested on whatever  is determined by governance. Taking into account a simplistic performance of those claims just using the Aave ecosystem, it’s possible that the treasury is not getting in the order of 5-10% over those claims at the moment (usually they are just governance power, but as reference).

So my proposal is creating an AIP to initiate all the previous, at least the initial versions, and in parallel activate the channels of communication and research on how to optimize the treasury.",28,95.2,2021-10-10
['ARC : When profits sharing?'],"This will be interesting to monitor because the proposal to launch Aave on Fantom (FTM) is soon submitted as an AIP and eligible for voting.
If the Snapshot or past proposals to support Polygon or Avalanche are any indication, I suspect this proposal will pass easily. Fantom will be another EVM chain to monitor treasury growth, as @eboado notes.",20,13.4,2021-10-12
['ARC : When profits sharing?'],"To continue the reflection, I agree with @eboado regarding the repatriation of fees from V1 to V2.
It would also be necessary to decide later whether the fees collected on the other chains should be brought back to the mainnet or else put to work on these side-chains.
Perhaps once the work of the genesis team on the inter-aave markets bridges will be live, this will include a solution to this problem.
Regarding yield-farming strategies in order to make this cash flow grow and to set up farming strategies, I leave it to @llamaDAO to think about the best possible choices and I count on @gauntlet to work (and justify its costs) on the risks involved in these strategies.
Initially, the goal of this reflection is to arrive at the financial autonomy of the protocol itself in a concern of decentralization.
The considerations on yields-farming or investments resulting from the putting to work of the treasury will come in a second step.
I will therefore propose a snapshot shortly on the community’s desire to complete the cash flow in a short time but before I would  like to have a feedback on the technical feasibility of what I have proposed.
Both on the possibility of depositing funds on the treasury and recovering aave from the reserve ecosystem in return as on the possibilities concerning a premium for investors, the use of a nft, etc.
We must also keep in mind that the technical realization must be simple and implementable within a reasonable period of time.
Do not hesitate to continue to comment if the subject seems important to you.
The goal of this reflection ultimately remaining decentralization and the possibility of activating one way or another the redistribution of the profits generated by the protocol and thus to encourage other than by subsidy in aave the aave holders.",16,12.4,2021-10-13

['Update on Aave Analytics and Growth Dashboard - Omni Analytics'],"Hello Aave Community,
We’re the Omni Analytics team and we wanted to give an update on the progress we’ve made on our Aave Grant, the Aave Analytics and Growth Dashboard.
Current Progress


We have optimized nearly every query in the existing Aave Growth Dashboard on Dune Analytics, in many cases improving the runtime by a factor of 100. This was done by performing more intelligent joins with the USD pricing data for the various tokens. The upshot of this is that nearly all queries run in a matter of seconds, and queries which were previously hitting Dune query limits on occasion are now executing successfully. Dune Analytics


We created an initial version of the Aave Growth Dashboard on Polygon. We created Polygon versions of each query, and queries which do not depend on USD pricing data have been included in the Dashboard. Dune Analytics


We’ve interfaced with the Covalent API in order to reconstruct approximately 2/3 of the existing queries from the Dune Analytics dashboard, using R and the tidyverse suite of packages. The visualizations have been written in ggplot2, allowing for significant refinement and flexibility, as well as aesthetic improvements, compared to the Dune dashboard.


The Aave data from the Covalent API has been structured in raw and aggregated formats so that they can be served up and provided to the community for further analysis. We have begun scoping out the initial API which will allow access to this structured Aave data.


Next Steps


The Polygon dashboard requires USD pricing data in order for many of the volume metric-based queries to be fully ported and visible. We are working with the team at Dune to get this data added, and will update the Dashboard accordingly once it is ready.


We are continuing to validate the Aave growth metrics obtained via the Covalent API to ensure they are consistent with the previously validated Dune metrics.


We will begin constructing the RShiny-based dashboard containing the available ported queries, and in the process optimize elements of the visuals, including improved axis labels, scaling, color schemes, and other visual elements of the plots.


The remaining queries, particularly on Economics and Staking, will be ported to R and use data derived from the Covalent API. Once ready, the plots for these will be reconstructed in R as well.

['Update on Aave Analytics and Growth Dashboard - Omni Analytics'],"Hello Aave Community!
Omni Analytics here again with another update for you on the Aave Analytics and Growth Dashboard. We’ve made some significant progress that we wanted to share:


We have a first version of the dashboard, including most of the metrics we’ve computed thus far, available to play with. We’ve written the dashboard in RShiny, with Flexdashboard powering the layout. Flexdashboard provides an extremely customizable but still easy-to-use layout engine, powered by RMarkdown. If you’re interested in some more details about Flexdashboard, please see the docs here: R Markdown Format for Flexible Dashboards • flexdashboard But at a high level, we now have:
a. The Covalent API for data access
b. The R engine for data parsing, cleaning, and manipulation
c. The Shiny server for dynamic and interactive computations
d. The Flexdashboard engine for templating and UI design of the dashboard
We think this stack provides a significant amount of flexibility both in terms of backend and frontend development, and future extensions.


We have cleaned up much of the analysis and posted initial versions of the code for both the backend API calls and the dashboard itself on our GitHub repository here: GitHub - Omni-Analytics-Group/Aave-Growth-Dashboard: Our R-based dashboard on the growth of Aave


Some next steps we will be taking:

Port the remaining queries from the Dune dashboard
Include them in the RShiny dashboard
Clean up and upload the remaining analysis code to the GitHub

['Update on Aave Analytics and Growth Dashboard - Omni Analytics'],"Hello Aave Community!
Omni Analytics is back with another update on our grant. Since last time, we’ve focused on two areas:


Aave on Polygon Dune Dashboard - The major updates here are (1) the introduction of several new outputs / queries, (2) the refinement of existing queries. We switched from using the Dune User Generated pricing data, to the official prices.usd table which is now available. We updated nearly every query to make this change, and did some cross-checking of the outputs. This should now be the most accurate picture yet of the growth of Aave on Polygon! Please let us know if you have any comments.


Aave on R Dashboard. We have added more options for interaction with the Aave on R dashboard. Some new features include:



The ability to select a date range for every plot
Aave-style branding on the plots
New transactions and user metrics
Updated design and layout

Omni Analytics back with another update. We’ve made two big additions that we hope the community loves:

We converted all the plots within the dashboard to interactive versions, using plotly - This not only adds some of the default interaction of the Dune dashboards, but also maintains the existing ggplot2 flexibility in terms of aesthetics. Now you can mouse over points, click to enable / disable legends, etc.
We have hosted the latest version of the application on our internal server, so that those without an R / Shiny local environment can access it. The app is available at: https://crypto.omnianalytics.io/apps/aave-growth/ The data has also been updated to the latest data as of today.

['ARC: Add Support for OHM'],"Summary
OHM is an independently-valued algorithmic currency that is backed by assets held in the Olympus treasury. The treasury accrues value using a novel bonding mechanism to offer OHM at a discount in exchange for assets (ex: DAI) and the protocols’ own liquidity (ex: OHM-DAI SushiSwap LP tokens). Profits accrued by the treasury when OHM trades above intrinsic value are redistributed to stakers for keeping OHM off the market during its initial growth phase. In the long run, OHM aims to be a free-floating currency that preserves value for its holders in contrast to traditional stablecoins denominated in USD which are subject to inflation. This proposal aims to introduce OHM to the Aave community and add OHM/sOHM to the Aave lending market.
Background on OHM and Bonding/Staking
Olympus launched OHM in March and has accumulated more than $60M in PCV, consisting of DAI, FRAX and OHM-DAI/FRAX liquidity pool tokens. Of the PCV, the non-OHM assets are considered the treasury’s risk-free value (RFV), currently worth $20M.
Treasury market operations consist of bonding, staking, and OHM repurchases. When OHM trades above its intrinsic value, Olympus sells OHM bonds at a discount to be redeemed over a 5-day vesting period. Bonding is an active, short-term strategy for market participants. Bonds allow Olympus to accumulate assets for backing OHM, as well as OHM’s own liquidity. Since the protocol owns its own liquidity, it provides implicit guarantees that liquidity will be available regardless of market sentiment. When OHM trades below its intrinsic value, the treasury buys back OHM using DAI. In this way, the treasury always positions itself to profit from market conditions and ensure liquidity for OHM.
Staking is the primary value accrual strategy for Ohmies. Stakers take their OHM off the market and in return receive a portion of the treasury’s profits earned on OHM sold through bonds. Stakers receive those profits through rebases to the sOHM token, which allows auto-compounding yield. Staking is a passive, long-term strategy.
Motivation
Integrating OHM in blue-chip DeFi protocols like Aave is a key milestone in the vision for OHM to become a dominant currency. Stablecoins are useful in their utility and for users’ familiarity with the US dollar, but will lead to a loss in value for users in the long-term. Aave’s lending protocol will provide an alternative source of yield for users’ OHM, as well as hedging strategies for Olympus bond buyers.
Benefits to Aave Community

Increased TVL - current Market Cap of OHM is $380M
Increased diversity of borrowing options
Synergies with the Olympus community

TL;DR
Add OHM/sOHM as collateral on Aave lending markets because Ohmies   (3,3)
Specifications
1. What is the link between the author of the ARC and the Asset?
Tex is a member of the OlympusDAO Partnerships Team, who is also the proud owner of a modest amount of AAVE.
2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token
OHM is a floating currency backed by assets including its own liquidity which is intended to maintain purchasing power for its holders.
3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?
OHM provides an alternative to stable assets denominated in USD. OHM is desirable for users to borrow and stake to earn staking rewards. Additionally, the treasury’s RFV provides a key metric that is available on-chain to gauge risk for OHM as collateral. Enabling OHM as collateral also provides a hedging mechanism for users participating in Olympus bond purchases.
4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?
Olympus launched OHM in March and has since accumulated $60M of treasury assets, including $20M of risk-free value (DAI/FRAX) and $40M of liquidity (OHM-DAI/FRAX). Since launch, Olympus has moved to a DAO governance-model with one of the larger active communities in DeFi.
5. How is the asset currently used?
OHM is currently being used to stake and redistribute profits from treasury open-market operations. These operations consist of selling bonds at a discount for assets and liquidity. OlympusDAO is actively launching community projects and exploring integrations with other protocols to expand OHM’s utility within DeFi. In addition to staking and bonding, sOHM deposits are available on Olympus’ Fuse pool as collateral.
6. Emission schedule
There is no capped emission schedule for OHM as a currency. Instead, OHM supply is controlled through policy parameters that adjust bond issuance. These parameters are adjusted by the DAO Policy Team (FOHMC) in response to market conditions. In this way, Olympus aims to be a Decentral Bank for DeFi.
7. Token & protocol permissions and upgradeability
Currently, the core Vault contract that manages assets which back OHM in circulation is non-upgrade-able. Staking, Treasury, and Allocator contracts are controlled by a multi-sig wallet (2/3, soon to be 3/5) controlled by the Core Team. The Distributor and Bond contracts which manage the protocol’s policy are under a separate multi-sig (3/5, soon to be 4/6) controlled by the DAO Policy Team.
8. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)
Market Cap: $380M
24h Volume: $10M
Exchanges: SushiSwap (OHM-DAI) and Uniswap (OHM-FRAX)
Volatility: 0.0862/0.113 (30D/90D volatility based on log-adjusted daily returns)

['ARC: Add Support for OHM'],"I would propose using wrapped sOHM (wsOHM) rather than sOHM.
Wrapped sOHM is a static-balance token that increases in redemption value at the same rate that sOHM increases in balance.
It has the same yield as sOHM, but the balance remains the same.
Given Aave’s rate cap, I believe this is the most appropriate. If lenders of OHM (or sOHM, it would be the same for either) can only earn 48% APY, I do not believe there would ever be supply available, and borrowing would enable a massive delta-neutral rate-arbitrage strategy.
With wsOHM, borrowers can borrow and owe a static amount, and a normal interest rate market can develop as with any other coin. This negates any challenges that may be posed by the rebasing nature of staked OHM. The one caveat is that liquidators will need to unwrap and unstake to gain access to the underlying OHM.",68,123.4,2021-07-26

['Launch Aave on Fantom'],"Fantom proposes deploying Aave v2 on the Fantom Opera blockchain to expand lending to the Fantom community and, with the provision of incentives, bootstrap the launch of Aave on a new ecosystem.
Summary
Fantom is an open-source, EVM-compatible blockchain that offers fast finality and low transaction fees. Openness and accessibility are core Fantom values that we practice through a cross-chain strategy that aligns with Aave goals. Examples include the token bridge Multichain.xyz, which Fantom developers including Andre Cronje, helped to launch.
We seek to support Aave in its multichain expansion and invite Aave to enable the Aave v2 front-end for Fantom markets. We believe that Fantom is ready-made to support Aave: Fantom offers a secure infrastructure, highly liquid markets, oracle integrations (such as Chainlink and Band Protocol), and an array of services, including on-chain explorers and indexing solutions (such as The Graph and Covalent).
To sustain rapid growth across the DeFi space, the Foundation recently launched a 370M FTM incentive program for developers. Upon reaching minimum TVL requirements, Aave will be eligible for incentive rewards to be used to grow the protocol on Fantom, including by incentivizing end-users.
Motivation
There is great potential for synergy between Fantom and Aave. The Fantom DeFi ecosystem is thriving: Total Value Locked across Fantom DeFi protocols is $5.78B (as of October 10) and growing. Many well-known protocols such as Yearn, SushiSwap, C.R.E.A.M., and Curve, amongst others, have deployed on Fantom.
On Fantom, Aave would find many users eager to participate in lending markets and add value to the Aave network.

Simple Summary
A proposal to adjust thirteen (13) total risk parameters across eleven (11) Aave V2 assets including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus.

Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of three risk parameters to align with the Moderate risk level chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet’s regular parameter recommendations, the latest being AIP-39: Risk Parameter Updates for Aave V2 assets.

Motivation
This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets. Volatility for non-stablecoin crypto assets remains high. As such, we focused on supporting protocol safety for our parameter changes in this cycle.
Adjustments were also made for three liquidation bonus values. These assets (UNI, BAL, LINK) saw increases in liquidity and trading volume and a reduced liquidation recommended value as a result. As always, simulation recommended values seek to maintain capital efficiency and uphold borrow usage levels.

See below volatility and exchange volume data from 9/28 to 10/06 that were important drivers for the updated parameter recommendations.
It is important to note that these drivers give insight into why Gauntlet’s simulations will output a new VaR calculation for a set of parameters, but each parameter can not be estimated by input changes. For example, the decrease in trading volume for DPI indicates lowered liquidity, while there are large increases for ENJ, MANA, and BAT. These suggest more liquidity and easier liquidations, but that relationship changes over time.

['Proposal: Aave Risk DAO'],"Hi Aave Community,
Since the launch of the second version of the Aave protocol (“V2” or the “Aave Protocol”) in January 2020, the Aave ecosystem has seen amazing growth, with over $20 billion of liquidity in the protocol and nearly $10 billion of borrows as well as over 200 integrations. In addition, the Aave Protocol is completely run by the community (“Community Governance”), with all decisions and changes for the protocol being implemented by Community Governance—that is, the group of over 90,000 holders of $AAVE or $StkAAVE.
With so much at stake, assessing risk is critical for the continued success of the Aave Protocol. Upgrades, asset additions, and changing market conditions have the potential to impact the protocol and the Safety Module. For that reason, it is critically important for the Aave governance community to have access to all relevant information and thorough analysis to support sound decision making.
Risk assessment for the protocol and safety module can require advanced skills (such as a deep understanding of smart contracts and digital assets) as well as significant familiarity with the Aave Protocol. With these needs in mind, I’d like to propose the formation of a dedicated Aave Risk DAO to help support the community’s stewardship of the Aave Protocol.

Risk DAO Overview
Aave already has an established risk framework, covering various aspects of the protocol including asset risk, liquidity risk, and technical risk. This Risk DAO will seek to build on this by supporting the Aave community in the following ways:

Providing information and research for decisions on asset listing, liquidity provision, and other risk related matters
Providing feedback and analysis on risk levels of forum and on chain proposals (ARCs and AIPs)
Providing documentation on risks to the Aave protocol and related risk factors
Engaging with third parties to better understand the Aave protocol’s ecosystem and to gain additional expertise
Providing independent assessment of AIPs priory to submission by community members, including technical and general risk analysis
At member’s discretion, submitting proposals to the Aave community to help address and mitigate risks

This will help give Aave governance greater information on (1) new asset additions and (2) technical upgrades that have the potential to increase protocol risk.
Through its various members, the Risk DAO will seek to provide coverage of the relevant risk areas in the Aave Protocol, including:

Oracle risk
Market risk
Governance risk
Technical risk
Risks pertaining to real world / off chain assets
Other risk related matters (including regulatory)

Members of the Risk DAO will dedicate 5-10 hours per week for a minimum term of one calendar quarter, with the ability for membership positions to be renewed subject to approval via governance. Applications are open and can be submitted as set out below.
Given the levels of expertise required, members will receive $100-500/hr monthly. Payment will be based on success metrics (level of participation, amount of reviews completed, etc). Reelected members should receive a bonus worth 10% of their previous quarter’s compensation.
Initially the starting budget should be roughly $150,000 per quarter - this covers 5 members working 10 hours per week at an average of $200 per hour, along with a small contingency budget for additional expenses. Member compensation will be based on the specific skills provided so individual members may earn more or less than $200 per hour. Considering the size of this grant, I intend to request funding directly from the Aave governance treasury rather than the Grants DAO to ensure continued funding of other community priorities.

My main focus area would be the on-chain/off-chain risks of upcoming Real world assets: credit, market, liquidity, operational, regulatory and liquidation risks.
Background
I am a senior risk analytics professional and data consultant with extensive hands-on experience in both banking quantitative risk functions and Blockchain, spanning startups and DeFi projects.
I’ve held senior quantitative analytics roles with exposure to modelling retail, SMEs and corporate credit risk for some of the biggest Australian banking groups, including Commonwealth Bank and Westpac. Modelling experiences include development of application, behaviour scorecards and risk-based pricing for origination, collections and account management strategies, as well as their production implementation through automated decisioning software. I’ve developed risk and pricing frameworks for corporate lending and securitised assets (asset-backed securities). Lately, I’ve been working with clients in top tier banking groups on automated data governance and regulation. Experience with regulation includes consultancy on risk frameworks relating to securities, capital adequacy, capital provision and liquidity requirements (Basel III, IV and IFRS9) across the banking sector.
Since 2016 I have worked on a variety of projects in the Blockchain world in software engineering (smart contract auditing), blockchain architecture and involvement in quantitative Risk in DeFi. My experience has been mostly with Ethereum and EVM projects. On smart contract & low-level engineering advisory I’ve worked with clients such as Shapeshift, Brave New Coin, tZero, Leverj, Kyber and Ripio Credit Network. In Risk, I’ve been working with the MakerDAO community since 2019 (SCD), initially as a community contributor then as part of the crypto native team. I’ve provided risk assessments, modelling and improvements to the risk framework to a number of collaterals onboarded into MCD. In 2020, I actively contributed to the creation of the MakerDAO RWA Risk team that set up the risk framework to onboard the first Centrifuge assets into the Maker protocol. Right now, I am building robust and asset class specific quantitative frameworks, simulations and automated performance monitoring for both Centrifuge and off-chain RWAs.
I’ve developed software engineering and data science skills through my working experiences across technology and risk analytics teams.

Describe your/the experts’ involvement in the Aave ecosystem and in the space more generally:
Blockchain@Berkeley (B@B) is and has been one of the most active student organizations in the Ethereum and DeFi community, paving the road for what leading blockchain student organizations look like since 2017. We’ve been actively involved in DeFi governance since December of 2020 and for nearly a year, B@B has reviewed and voted on proposals for some of the top DeFi protocols such as Aave, Compound, and Uniswap. B@B is aiming to become a significant community member in DeFi and joining Aave’s Risk DAO would be a huge step toward that goal. Over the past year alone, our education department has leveraged dedicated research projects to further understand and analyze the mechanics of DeFi and create models that can be used to better evaluate DeFi markets. One such long-term project ‘Stable Sims’ enabled a simulation of the Maker Protocol using different liquidation mechanics and stress-tests of these mechanisms under various market conditions.
What skills/experience do you/they bring?
B@B is made up of nearly 60 driven & passionate students with a breakdown of roughly 60% developers, the remaining 40% is made up of business development experts, designers, and education members. Our developers would likely be our biggest value add to the Risk DAO. Not only do all our developers do a 120 hour Web3.0 development course covering Solidity, React, and MongoDB but they are also deeply passionate and involved in the Blockchain community outside of B@B with many interning at different DeFi and Web3 companies over the summer. We believe that by participating in the Aave Risk DAO we can advance our skills and rise to meet any potential challenges while pushing the Aave protocol forward.

['Proposal: Aave Risk DAO'],"Hi! asdpc.eth here speaking in behalf of Witnet Foundation.
Witnet Foundation is a non-profit originally dedicated to stewarding the advancement of the Witnet oracle protocol and ecosystem.
We see oracles and price feeds as one of the most crucial public goods in the ecosystem right now. Given any oracle or price feed solution, regardless of its degree of decentralization, it can always introduce a single point of failure. As soon as many players are relying on an oracle or price feed and the stakes are high enough, the incentives exist for it to be attacked, and for the relaying protocols to be taken advantage of.
At the end of the day, when projects decide to use a 3rd party oracle, they are basically outsourcing one key part of their system — and namely one that is crucial for their security, liveness, viability and reputation. This is an often overlooked issue, and one that can come back to bite us anytime.
Ever since we started designing the Witnet decentralized oracle back in 2017, we had this vision of giving developers “the oracle that Ethereum deserves”. That is, a set of oracle solutions that lives up to the decentralization and censorship resistance properties that Ethereum itself offers. In other words, helping the Ethereum and Web3 ecosystem to reduce the systemic risk that oracle solutions can introduce if they are not designed and executed properly.
In this fight against systemic risk, we believe that, beyond fostering specific oracle solutions, we need to take a step forward and work side by side with the BUIDLers and projects out there to help them assess and improve their policies regarding oracles, price feeds and decentralization in general.
Also in that same spirit of cooperation for the good of the ecosystem, we partenered with Tellor, Band, Razor and others in creating the Alliance of Decentralized Oracles, an informal work group that is already working on an EIP proposing a standard interface for price feeds. This unified interface aims to make the developers’ life easier by enabling them to use one oracle solution or another in a plug-and-play manner. This also makes it super easy to create price feed contracts that aggregate data from multiple oracle solutions and leverage on their different designs. If you want to hack those, you need to hack several oracles with radically different security models.
As strong supporters of decentralization and DAOs, blending ourselves into other communities is our preferred way of collaboration — and actually the only one that makes sense for us.
Because of all of this, Witnet Foundation is applying to join the Aave Risk DAO. We are obviously most interested in the oracle risk chapter, but we are also ready to put into value the rich know-how in other areas of our cross-functional team.
In practice, Witnet Foundation can commit to the following meaningful contributions:

Reports and documentation on the current oracle policy of the Aave protocol, paying special attention to identifying and evaluating the risks to mitigate and any theoretic attack vectors.
Proposals on how to improve the current oracle policy, including the general strategy, as well as the business logic of the Price Oracle contract, the fallback oracle system, and the individual price feeds that power each of the supported assets.
Research and analysis on the performance of the existing price feeds, both from objective metrics and from a subjective “compared to expectations” point of view.
Assessment, documentation, recommendations, and participation in discussions about the oracle risk, trust model and security considerations of specific ARCs and AIPs, including those proposing addition of new assets, and those proposing technical changes or upgrades.
Review of price feeds and their quality, sustainability and suitability for ARCs and AIPs proposing addition of new assets.
Design and implementation of additional price feeds contracts so as to increase the diversity of data sources available for existing and future assets on Aave.
Fostering the involvement of other members of the Alliance of Decentralized Oracles in relevant oracle-related discussions.
Technical due diligence of projects, assets and proposals.
Review, auditing and documentation of smart contracts security and trust models, both for the Aave code base, the contracts of existing and proposed assets, and 3rd party protocols and dApps that may integrate with Aave behind the curtains.
Elaboration and cooperation on the creation of risk mitigation proposals to the governance forum on behalf of the RiskDAO.

['Proposal: Aave Risk DAO'],"Hi all,
It’s been a while since last posting updates here, but we’re now ready to move forward with risk dao proposal. I’m sharing the proposal text below, and will put up a Snapshot poll tomorrow to gauge community sentiment on the proposal before putting up an on chain governance vote. Any feedback or comments from the community are welcomed and appreciated!
A note for prospective contributors - we reached a decent initial budget based on contributors who engaged with the process beginning earlier this summer, so I was not able to engage with everyone who expressed interest in contributing to risk DAO in this initial proposal. Once we get the organization up and running, I think they may be scope to onboard additional members as needed in future renewals. My sincere apologies to anyone who was not able to be included in initial scope of this proposal, I look forward to continuing to work together for the benefit of the Aave protocol and community  I also think strategically it makes sense to onboard individual contributors to a core risk DAO organization before considering engagement with outside organizations and service providers.


Simple Summary
A proposal to fund the Aave Risk DAO, an organization of contributors dedicated to risk analysis for the Aave protocol.

Abstract
The Aave Risk DAO will provide professional, committed risk analysis to support the Aave protocol and community. Key focus areas include asset onboarding, additional money markets, new risk management features, and supporting community initiatives.

Motivation
The Aave protocol is evolving rapidly with new features, integrations, assets, and markets. Aave users and token holders rely on the protocol to operate securely and safeguard the funds deposited in Aave markets and the safety module. Committed professional analysis will help governance and the community mitigate risk and take advantage of new opportunities with greater confidence.
The Risk DAO will initially focus on the following areas:

Reviewing proposed new assets for technical and market risks
Facilitating community discussions through biweekly risk calls
Building dashboards and tooling to help increase understanding of Aave protocol risk factors
Evaluating markets for cross chain deployments or new asset types
Commenting on community led initiatives that affect protocol risk

Refer to the Aave governance forum post for additional details on Risk DAO scope and priorities.
The Risk DAO will seek to work collaboratively with Gauntlet Network, which recently received approval for dynamic risk parameter management of the primary Aave v2 money market on Ethereum mainnet. Gauntlet’s engagement will allow the Risk DAO to focus on other important priorities for Aave risk management. We will remain open to opportunities for collaboration with Gauntlet and other Aave contributors including the Aave Grants DAO.

Implementation
The Aave Risk DAO will be funded for an initial operating period of 3 months (12 weeks). At the conclusion of this period, the community can review performance and determine next steps for extending the program.

Initial contributors:
Project management and governance

monet-supply

Market risk and analytics

Thomas
Jack
Roberto
Jeremy

Technical risk

Mateusz

Real world asset risk

Will

Student contributors

Members of Blockchain at Berkeley

Members will post short introductions below. Additional contributors may be onboarded to the Risk DAO as needed with mutual agreement of existing members, with any new contributors providing introduction details and falling under the existing Risk DAO budget outlined below. Budget changes will require consent of Aave governance.

Budget
Contributor Payments
Technical Risk - 10 hours per week at $225/hour
Market Risk and Analytics - 30 hours per week at $200/hour
Real World Asset Risk - 10 hours per week at $225/hour
Project Management and Governance - 10 hours per week at $100/hour
Student Contributors - 15 hours per week at $100/hour
Total: $156,000 over 3 months ($13,000 per week)
Miscellaneous Expenses
This budget category includes spending on software, infrastructure, and other miscellaneous expenses. The Risk DAO will submit an invoice detailing itemized costs and descriptions for any miscellaneous expenses on a monthly basis.
Total: $30,000 over 3 months
Grand total: $186,000 over 3 months

Payout Mechanism
We will establish a multisig wallet to hold operational funding for the Aave Risk DAO. The multisig will require 4 of 6 signers to move funds or take other action. The proposed signers are listed below:
Monetsupply (Risk DAO contributor)
Tom Borgers (Risk DAO contributor)
Jack Clancy (Risk DAO contributor)
Nick Cannon (Gauntlet)
John Morrow (Gauntlet)
1 additional Aave community member not affiliated with Risk DAO (TBD)
Due to potential price volatility between proposal submission and final approval, the Risk DAO is requesting $204,600 worth of AAVE tokens (final amount of tokens to be determined based on AAVE price when on-chain proposal is submitted), representing a 10% surplus buffer over the stated budget. Funds will be converted by the multisig to stablecoins (DAI or USDC) when received, to minimize volatility and avoid funding shortfalls.
Each month, the multisig will transfer payments to Risk DAO contributors for the upcoming month. In addition, the multisig will transfer reimbursements for any miscellaneous expenses incurred over the previous month.
At the conclusion of the 3 month period, the multisig will return any unused funds to Aave governance. Additionally, Aave governance may request early termination of the Risk DAO and return of funds via the AIP process.
Risk DAO contributors who are reconfirmed for a new term of membership at the end of this period should be eligible for a 10% bonus paid in AAVE tokens, calculated based on their total compensation earned over the 3 month initial period covered by this proposal. This bonus payment is contingent on renewal by Aave governance, so the necessary funds would be requested in a future proposal.
Proposal transaction(s):
Transfer $204,600 worth of AAVE tokens from ecosystem reserve to the Risk DAO multisig

['Proposal: add support for AMPL'],"Hi Aave fam,
I’m Brandon, a co-founder and developer at Ampleforth.
I’d like to make a proposal for Aave to support AMPL as a collateral asset and currency. We think being able to lend and borrow AMPL on Aave would open up new and unique trading strategies not possible before in traditional finance.
Why aAMPL
AMPL brought the concept of rebasing tokens to DeFi, was an early player in Liquidity Mining, and we continue active development with new projects like the Balancer Smart Pool.
We’ve developed deep liquidity on AMMs like Uniswap, SushiSwap, Mooniswap, and Balancer, and now a natural progression is to create an AMPL lending market. We would love to build on top of this strong, liquid foundation by partnering with the innovative Aave community.
Being able to borrow and lend AMPL would enable holders to:

Utilize a new, low-correlated collateral asset which could reduce risk
Decrease exposure to rebases in exchange for income from interest
Use a non-collateralized asset that “borrows like a stablecoin”
Create leveraged AMPL trades and unlock derivatives
Create interest bearing AMPL that can be staked in other protocols
Increase exposure to AMPL & farming

We think the unique nature of this asset and its interactions with rebases will create an active and vibrant market, and bring new and interesting possibilities to Aave users.
Future Collaborations
Eventually, we would also like to join the Aave Uniswap Market with the AMPL/ETH pool, and would love to create a dedicated Geyser program that incentivizes this. Such a program would allow users to generate returns from Uniswap, Aave, and the Ample Geysers all at the same time.
Onward, to the future of elastic finance!

['Proposal: add support for AMPL'],"I support this!
Debt denomination is a key use case of AMPL. Let’s take a look at why:
You have the option to borrow 1 of 4 assets, but you must repay the same asset in 10 years time: USD, AMPL, GOLD, or BTC. Which do you choose?
The risks of each include price and inflation risk. In 10 years, USD may have experienced significant inflation (making it interesting to borrow, but perhaps not to lend…), whereas both Gold and Bitcoin may have changed dramatically in price (making them interesting to lend, but not borrow…). Imagine that instead of buying 2 pizzas with Bitcoin many years ago, that individual had borrowed Bitcoin to buy the pizzas. They would find it hard to repay that loan today…
AMPL solves all of these issues through its elastic supply protocol. The price target is inflation-adjusted and the protocol is designed to always seek the equilibrium price target over time.
Therefore, if you borrowed 1,000 AMPL today, at around $1,000 USD value, you could enjoy a fair degree of certainty that in 10 years you will be able to purchase again 1,000 AMPL for around the equivalent of $1,000 USD in today’s dollars. This makes AMPL uniquely safe for debt denomination. This can be seen empirically by observing AMPL’s price performance in the market for over 12+ months now: the protocol has succeeded in driving the price back towards equilibrium repeatedly, despite dramatic changes in market capitalization.
Having AMPL available for on-chain borrow/lend is one of the key steps to move AMPL forward as a unique DeFi asset and building block.
As an aside, this also is what makes AMPL a more ideal base money. Because of the extreme long-term price volatility of fixed supply assets like gold and bitcoin, they are less suited for long-term debt denomination. On the other hand, discretionary fiat currencies are problematic because of a lack of clarity around how to manage monetary inflation rates in relation to macroeconomic conditions. AMPL solves these problems with a clear and simple rules-based monetary policy and elastic currency supply. The result is that AMPL can serve as a more stable and sound economic foundation for complex financial systems.
Enabling borrow/lend for AMPL is a crucial first step in this process.",183,1216.6,2020-10-15

All money in the world is some sort of consensus, USD is a consensus that FED will execute monetary policy prudently.
All current forms of (lets call them) “hard money” in the universe of blockchain assets is either basic fraud like USDT, or relies on volatile assets to collaterise (DAI, SNX etc). Despite some success of those instruments, you cannot reasonably argue, that DAI for instance is a true stable coin, because it relies on volatile collateral.
AMPLFORTH on the other hand is pure algorithmic “store of value” and as such is not subjected to excess volatility of underlying collateral. Like all money in the world it does not rely on anything but consensus between economic agents.
I cannot not give credit to instruments like DAI or SNX or anything else of the like, there indeed served important purpose in some short to middle term as intermediary instruments, however its important to consider long term aspects of the industry, and in the long term they cannot be effective.

['ARC: Add Gelato’s G-UNI ERC20 Uniswap v3 positions as collateral to Aave’s AMM market'],"1. Who is the interested party for this collateral application?
This collateral application was created by the Gelato Network development team. Gelato is Ethereum’s automation protocol and offers a series of automation services focussed on DeFi, including limit orders on AMMs, Aave liquidation protection and an automated liquidity provision solution for Uniswap v3 Liquidity provides called G-UNI, the latter being the proposed collateral type for this proposal.
2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token.
G-UNI is an ERC20 wrapper around Uniswap v3 LP NFTs which can be used to make liquidity provision on Uniswap v3 fungible and its fee reinvestment process automated. It basically turns Uniswap V3s liquidity positions into Uniswap v2 like ERC20 tokens.
G-UNI tokens have already been adopted by a wide series of projects such as MakerDAO, Instadapp, Rari, and many more.
Based on several discussions with Aave stakeholders and Uniswap v3 Liquidity providers, we believe that the G-UNI DAI / USDC, DAI / USDT and USDC / USDT pool tokens would provide great value to Aave users as an efficient way of utilizing their USDC, DAI and USDT collateral to borrow other tokens while earning compounding trading fees on Uniswap v3. Moreover, this would enable Aave users to go leverage on their Uniswap v3 positions and potentially 50x the liquidity they provide and thus significantly increase their fees earned.
G-UNI tokens have the following functionalities:

Simplicity: Having a simple one size fits all liquidity strategy making market making very accessible for everyone as users don’t have to actively manage their position
Fee Compounding: Reinvesting the earned trading fees back into the pool resulting in an automated compounding effect
Fungibility: One Uniswap LP token is equal to another, meaning they can be used as money legos in other protocols such as on Maker for collateral or for liquidity mining schemes like what Instadapp is doing, making the underlying capital hyper-efficient

Users can always exchange G-UNI tokens for the corresponding underlying tokens (e.g. DAI & USDC) and the accrued fees that are currently being stored on Uniswap v3 by the G-UNI contract. G-UNI uses no external oracles or other dependencies and G-UNI tokens can be minted and burned at any point in time by liquidity providers.
G-UNI tokens can be created permissionlessly by anyone for any Uniswap v3 pool. However, this application only concerns three specific G-UNI pool which has DAI, USDC and USDT as the underlying tokens which are provided as liquidity on Uniswap v3. More G-UNI pools that have different underlying tokens can be added in separate Collateral Onboarding proposals in the future.
The automated reinvestment of fees is a key feature of G-UNI pools, which is conducted by bots of the Gelato Network which act similar to Maker Keepers. Those bots constantly monitor the accrued fees of each pool and execute the fee reinvestment function when sufficient fees have been collected and it is worth executing it. Ranges of the pools cannot be adjusted by bots and will remain static.
Each G-UNI pool takes a 1% cut of the accrued fees when reinvesting the fees for building, operating and further improving the G-UNI system.
You can watch a video of Gelato Legendary Member Ari Rodriguez explaining how G-UNI works here.
3. Provide a brief history of the project
Gelato Network was started 2 years ago by Hilmar Maximilian Orth and Luis Schliesske after working together with Gnosis on building automated trading functionalities on top of one of their decentralized exchanges. The two quickly realized that it was very cumbersome and hard to maintain specialized bots / keepers that have to be custom developed for each use case that requires some transactions to be executed automatically at certain times in the future.
Thus they ought to build a generalistic protocol that enables developers to plug into an already existing decentralized network of bots that they can task to execute arbitrary smart contract functions on Ethereum. Since launching in July 2020, many of the top projects in DeFi have integrated Gelato to power their web3 automation needs, including projects such as Instadapp, Zerion, Furucombo, KeeperDAO, Quickswap and AMMs such as Spookyswap.
Gelato’s development team not only builds the underlying protocol and the infrastructure, but also develops interesting automation use cases in-house themselves, of which G-UNI is one of them.
G-UNI contracts were tested thoroughly and audited by two external Audit companies as well as multiple times by the MakerDAO core development team. Having MakerDAO adopt the G-UNI framework should greatly reduce the risk for Aave as a lot of due diligence has been done from their side and all the necessary contracts for an integration have already been written (such as an Oracle contract that prices G-UNI tokens).

6. How is the applying collateral type currently used?
G-UNI tokens are used to enable multiple parties to provide liquidity on Uniswap v3 collectively around the same range in a fungbile manner. The USDC / DAI G-UNI pool for example earns fees with a very concentrated liquidity around the $1 range (e.g. 0.9994 - 1.0014) of the DAI / USDC pair on Uniswap v3. Generated fees are directly reinvested into the pool and accounted for when LPs burn their G-UNI tokens in order to receive back the underlying DAI / USDC.
As the stablecoin pair prices should remain rather constant, we don’t need any readjustments of the range.
7. Where does exchange for the asset occur?
The G-UNI DAI / USDC token is just a wrapper around regular DAI and USDC tokens which can be exchanged on multiple decentralized and centralized trading venues. G-UNI tokens can be burned at any time to redeem the underlying DAI / USDC based on the current ratio of the pool.

Paragraph Summary
Based on several discussions with Aave stakeholders and Uniswap v3 Liquidity providers, we believe that the G-UNI DAI / USDC, DAI / USDT and USDC / USDT pool tokens would provide great value to Aave users as an efficient way of utilizing their USDC, DAI and USDT collateral to borrow other tokens while earning compounding trading fees on Uniswap v3. Moreover, this would enable Aave users to go leverage on their Uniswap v3 positions and potentially 50x the liquidity they provide and thus significantly increase their fees earned.
Motivation
G-UNI is an ERC20 wrapper around Uniswap v3 LP NFTs which can be used to make liquidity provision on Uniswap v3 fungible and its fee reinvestment process automated. It basically turns Uniswap V3s liquidity positions into Uniswap v2 like ERC20 tokens.
G-UNI tokens have already been adopted by a wide series of projects such as MakerDAO, Instadapp, Rari, and many more.
Specifications
1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?
Gelato is the development team behind G-UNI
2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token
The token is a wrapper around stablecoin pairs on Uniswap v3, it only uses Gelato’s network of keepers to automate fee compounding
3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?
G-UNI would enable Aave users to go leverage on their Uniswap v3 positions and potentially 50x the liquidity they provide and thus significantly increase their fees earned.
4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are the live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?
G-UNI was deployed to Mainnet in June 2021 and since then projects such as Instadapp, MakerDAO, Float and Rari have integrated it. We worked a lot to understand the inner mechanism of Uniswap v3 and did 2 external audits to ensure the smart contracts we are using are secure.
5. How is the asset currently used?
As Collateral in MakerDAO or for Liquidity mining incentives in projects such as Float or Fei for example.
6. Emission schedule
No emission
7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?
All pools will be immutable, as the upgradability key will or already has been burned.
8. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)
Volume corresponds to the volume of DAI, USDC and USDT on Uniswap v3
9. Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)
Over 20k on Twitter and 16k on Telegram
10. Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens
Deployed quite recently, around 50 transactions for the pools, only a couple of holders right now, but will most likely change with MakerDAO having integrated it",18,23.6,2021-09-23

['ARC: Add Gelato’s G-UNI ERC20 Uniswap v3 positions as collateral to Aave’s AMM market'],"Risk Analysis
Below is the risk analysis for the G-UNI DAI/USDC token. G-UNI is an LP token, simply put it is a fungible wrapper on a Uniswap V3 LP Position. This means G-UNI token risk is associated to its three underlying asset types:

DAI Stablecoin
USDC Stablecoin
Uniswap V3 DAI/USDC 0.05% (Non Fungible) LP Positions

To understand the risks we’ll look at these underlying assets, as well as the G-UNI token itself.

Screen Shot 2021-10-05 at 7.55.58 AM1099×178 29.6 KB

DAI: overall risk score of B+. DAI has relatively low smart contract risk (SAI contracts on mainnet since 2017, DAI since 2019) and market risk (this stablecoin does half a billion in volume per month). The lowest subscore is counterparty risk: centralized price feeds and some central controls over the minting of DAI and MKR.
USDC: overall risk score of A- Again the smart contract risk and market risks are low - with high volume and millions of successful transactions without critical vulnerabilities. The main risk is centralized controls, since CENTRE Consortium is the central issuer of USDC and manages the backing of the token with fiat.
Uniswap V3 USDC/DAI 0.05% LP: overall risk score of A- The Uniswap V3 smart contracts are newer but have still been battle tested over the last 6 months (3M transactions, 150k+ transactions on this market). The centralization risks on Uniswap markets are low (permissionless), and this pool has done decent volume. Uniswap V2 DAI/USDC market had an overall risk score of A-, this V3 market (with increased volume and decreased volatility) should be equal or better.
Since G-UNI is really just a fungible wrapper around a Uniswap V3 Position we will use the Market Risk section of the Uniswap V3 DAI/USDC LPs when assessing G-UNI market risks (not just the market for the G-UNI wrapper token). This is reasonable since when assessing the risk of Uniswap V2 (fungible) LP token collateral we would look at the entire market and not just a single Liquidity Provider.
G-UNI Smart Contract Risk: C- G-UNI smart contracts are undoubtedly new. They have existed for even a shorter time than Uniswap V3 (less than 6 months). However, in that time the G-UNI system has been interacted with roughly 25k times without issue. We also received two external audits as well as thorough audits from MakerDAO when onboarded as collateral there.
G-UNI Counterparty Risk: B- G-UNI DAI/USDC is entirely permissionless and trustless. For this particular G-UNI pool there are no centralized controls or admins with special privileges (note: other G-UNI token contracts are currently still upgradable by admin multisig). That said, there are still a low number of token holders (less than 100), thus the B- score.
G-UNI Market Risk: A The Uniswap V3 DAI/USDC market is only 6 months old, but healthy (greater than 400k volume last month). The concentrated liquidity of V3 allows stablecoin markets in particular to maintain much less volatility compared to Uniswap V2 AMM. Uniswap V2 DAI/USDC pair scored A in market risk, V3 likely scores even better (A+) due to decreased volatility and increased volume on stablecoin pairs, but conservatively we gave it the equal A rating.
This would give G-UNI DAI/USDC an overall risk score of roughly B- using Aave’s methodology. That said, this unique LP asset is not perfectly suited to the methodology. With different metrics the risks of G-UNI actually seem quite low: the volatility is surprisingly minimal and liquidation risks are similarly extremely low. Read a full write-up about the risks of this G-UNI pool by MakerDAO’s risk team here
Parameter Suggestion
Because of the stable nature of G-UNI DAI/USDC the collateralization ratio could be quite low (in MakerDAO G-UNI has a Min. Collateralization Ratio of 105%) but to air on the side of caution we propose these parameters (same as Uniswap V2 USDC/DAI Aave params):
Currency: yes
Collateral: yes
Loan to Value: 60%
Liquidation Threshold: 70%
Liquidation Bonus: 15%
Reserve Factor: 10%",11,57.0,2021-10-06
['Aave Deployment on Avalanche + Asset Validation List'],"Avalanche: Signal for deployment
Summary
The Avalanche Foundation asks for signaling from the Aave community to accept a deployment of the Aave Protocol into Avalanche.
Proposer
The Avalanche Foundation is dedicated to supporting the Avalanche ecosystem and related technologies. The Foundation is part of a larger Avalanche ecosystem and working with other organizations to support the significant development of Avalanche-related technologies.
Avalanche is one of the fastest smart contracts platforms in the blockchain industry, as measured by time-to-finality, and has the most validators securing its activity of any proof-of-stake protocol. Avalanche’s C-Chain is an instance of the EVM running with Avalanche’s consensus.
Rationale


Current status of the Avalanche C-Chain: The Avalanche network is secured by over 1,000 validators and is scalable to tens or hundreds of thousands of participants due to the performance of Avalanche consensus. While maintaining this level of decentralization, the network can deal with high throughput and provides instant finality in 1-2 seconds, making the network’s C-Chain an incredible playground for DeFi and other EVM applications. The ecosystem already has a slew of native projects offering exchange, lending, and aggregation services, over $1.5bn bridged from Ethereum, over $2.2bn in TVL, and protocols such as SushiSwap and Curve deployed or in the process of deploying.


Why it is good for the Aave ecosystem: The Avalanche blockchain is well-suited for building DeFi applications due to scalability, high throughput, and near-instant finality. Through the Avalanche Rush program, the Avalanche foundation has allocated up to $20M AVAX for users of the Aave protocol over a three-month period to earn AVAX rewards while using Aave on Avalanche for the first phase of the program. This program will bring new users to the platform, and reach more users from the established Avalanche community. Having the Aave community embrace deployment on established chains like Avalanche will allow more users to access Aave’s offerings across the DeFi ecosystem.


Why signaling is necessary? Consistent with the ethos of the Aave ecosystem, he Avalanche Foundation believes that all deployments of the Aave protocol should be voted on – and accepted by – Aave governance prior to deployment. The Avalanche Rush announcement received a lot of interest from both the Aave and Avalanche communities. Deploying the Aave protocol on Avalanche will support growth and synergies between the communities, ultimately leading to a stronger DeFi ecosystem.


Next Steps

Creation of Snapshot vote for the Aave community to signal YES/NO for deployment on Avalanche.
Deployment of smart contracts in Avalanche C-Chain and activation of liquidity mining program.

After the Acceptance of the deployment of Aave to Avalanche by the community, we would like to validate the list of initial assets and configurations of the deployment, which are listed below. In addition, a Snapshot proposal has been created.

['ARC: Gauge vote incentives on convex to increase stables supply'],"Reference two AAVE related pools on Curve in ETH mainnet:
SAAVE (SUSD & DAI): currently has $189 million down from $266 last week
AAVE (USDT USDC & DAI): currently has $183 million down from $216 last week
There’s a pool on polygon:
AAVE (USDT USDC & DAI) which has gotten a bribe from Polygon in the form of MATIC and seen its TVL and APY shoot up
Both these have had veCRV votes shift out en masse to other pools due to incentives.
Given the above, we could effectively have Curve / Convex subsidize stable coin availability through their token emissions on their pools. Those stablecoins get lent out on AAVE, so this should create a cheaper cost of funds for AAVE and therefore lead to more stable APY for lending, especially as these funds could become relatively sticky.
I propose on a trial basis we carry out a 20 stkAAVE incentive for gauge weight votes to each of the SAAVE and AAVE pools for the votes from the second Convex vote in October through the end of 2021, at which point we reassess and decide to continue. That’s about !1K USD at current prices per vote.
I propose stkAAVE as it could be support for our own stability pool. Presumably most individuals would accumulate multiple incentives before liquidating and some would keep it around as a long-term hold.
I suggest we use votium.app as this would probably be more efficient in terms of generating votes per token spent, noting the greater concentration of voting power within CVX. It also means only paying once every two weeks.
Next vote is for 14 October, but we ought to get the offer in well before, so we may not pass governance and other processes until the vote of 28 October. That means five votes would be covered by this proposal for a total of 200 AAVE tokens or about 55K USD.
I welcome your feedback and thoughts about improvements.",18,18.6,2021-09-25
['ARC: Gauge vote incentives on convex to increase stables supply'],"Thank you for your response.
The goal here is to take advantage of this method to lower AAVE’s cost of funds on stablecoins that can be lent out and to help keep AAVE a competitive offering. I believe the proposal would result in those getting an increase in CRV emissions and therefore keep liquidity in the pool, which flows downstream to AAVE and allows us to better serve more borrowers. There were about $350K USD in total value of incentives offered on Thursday’s vote, which means that those two pools would be about 1.4% of gauge vote incentives and hopefully an equal amount of gauge votes which means that they should be able to maintain satisfactory liquidity.
TVL on Curve as a platform has remained steady (strictly speaking it went from 12.6 to 13.1 billion on the same snapshot dates i.e. the day before change reward rates to Saturday 25th), but it went down from 13.1 billion the previous day, so let’s call it flat). So I doubt it has to do with market volatility.
Note the bribe I referred to is the one offered by Polygon on the bribe.crv.finance platform - which is separate from the MATIC rewards being paid out to the pool directly as it went to veCRV holders who voted to support that pool getting more emissions. I’m proposing only the amount specified (20 stkAAVE per pool per vote until year end for gauge vote incentives), not an increase in incentives paid directly to LP participants. Again that goes straight through to AAVE Polygon stablecoin availability.",17,8.4,2021-09-26
['ARC: Gauge vote incentives on convex to increase stables supply'],"I personally disagree with AAVE participating in the bribery game of buying CRV votes for incentives, at least on Polygon. It seems unclear to me how these incentives would actually benefit the AAVE protocol. With fees being so low on Polygon, it is fairly trivial to obtain aTokens the standard way, e.g. just depositing the corresponding stablecoin to receive aTokens. I’m not really sure what the point of being able to trade aTokens is, and think that organic liquidity on CRV is sufficient for the edge cases in which people for some reason would actually want to swap stablecoin aTokens.
Please let me know if I’m missing something here.",16,33.2,2021-09-26
['ARC: Gauge vote incentives on convex to increase stables supply'],"Thank you for your response.
The proposal relates to the two AAVE ETH pools, as the Polygon one seems to be getting a subsidy from the network. Since every stablecoin deposited in those pools goes into AAVE directly, it is to our advantage to take advantage of this as a funding source. The CRV emissions on these pools fell from over 10% to less than 1% as a result of the last CRV gauge vote. I propose this as an experiment to see whether this could be a mechanism to restore those to normal and therefore mantain the size of the pool.
At their current size, those two pools are :

90.4M of 102M USD funding in SUSD o/w 53.5M is borrowed (so more than freely available)
134.2M of 1.8G USD funding in DAI o/w 1.5G is borrowed (almost half of available)
73M of 5.9G USD funding in USDC o/w 5.2G is borrowed (10% of what is available)
68.6M of 1.2G USD funding in USDT o/w 1.1G is borrowed (over half of what is availble)

So if those pools shrink materially, that would create a major disruption on the SUSD pool, and a noticeable one on DAI and USDT. Looks like a non-event on the USDC pool.
We should likely assume that anyone exiting those two pools will either invest in another Curve / Convex pool or on another platform, and that few would redirect their investment to AAVE.",16,8.2,2021-09-26

I noticed that Compound pool has a votium bribe of 11420.69 DAI (odd amount) which corresponds to 37 AAVE.

AAVE pool is down to 34.5M DAI, 65.3M USDC, 54.4M USDT (154.2M USD)

Backd, an Aave grants recipient, is a new type of DeFi protocol that deploys reactive liquidity pools. Backd enables users to simultaneously earn yield and Backd rewards while protecting their Aave loans from liquidation.
How this works is users can provide liquidity on Backd (which is deployed to yield-farming strategies) and then register their Backd liquidity to their Aave loan. If the registered loan becomes at risk of liquidation the Backd protocol shifts the user’s liquidity from yield farming over to their collateral to prevent or mitigate liquidation risk.

I’m one of the co-founders of Numio, and we are focused on providing the best UX for people when interacting on Ethereum and Layer 2. We launched the first mobile app natively supporting zkRollups last year, and we are also the first team to launch a mobile app on zkSync!
We are actively working on building support for Aave inside of our app. This support will be on Layer-1 initially, but our UI is modular which will allow you to easily manage your funds from multiple L2s (or other L1s if they are supported in the app in the future).
September Developer Update: https://www.numio.one/developer-update-september-15th/
While borrowing wouldn’t necessarily be possible on L2 (at least until general purpose smart contracts are live with zkSync 2.0), we are planning to enable for people to have the ability to swap to interest bearing assets (using atomic swaps), so they can have access to these kinds of DeFi functionalities on L2, where it would be impossible to do so on L1 due to network fees.
Our team is incredibly passionate around building/curating educational content- there can literally never be enough of it out there! Our team has been doing this for the last few months building both written and video content (the latter being done by myself on TikTok). We’ve already begun building some for Aave, and obviously will continue to do so where we can. One example of written content can be found here: https://www.numio.one/tokens/aave/
In any case, I look forward to being more involved in the forums here, and hopefully meeting many of you IRL at different crypto events in the future!

['ARC: Risk Parameter Updates 2021-09-30'],"
Simple Summary
A proposal to adjust thirteen (13) total risk parameters across nine (9) Aave V2 assets including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus.

Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of three risk parameters based on previously selected community risk level preferences. First, a continuation of the two previous liquidation bonus updates, AIP-34: Liquidation Bonus Updates and AIP-38: Liquidation Bonus Updates for Eleven Aave V2 Assets. Second, updated LTV and Liquidation Threshold parameters to realign with the Moderate risk level chosen by the community.

Motivation
This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets. While increased volatility affected most assets in the ecosystem, some tail assets experienced even higher volatility and larger collateral usage (supply that is significantly borrowed against). In addition, increased liquidity and decreased trading slippage for certain assets allow for lower liquidation bonuses.

['Proposal: Add Support for stETH (Lido)'],"We would like to submit a proposal to onboard Lido’s stETH.
stETH Overview
The Lido Protocol, built on Ethereum 2.0’s beacon chain, allows users to earn staking rewards on the beacon chain without locking Ether or maintaining staking infrastructure.
Lido allows users to deposit ETH and receive stETH. The deposited ETH is then pooled and staked with node operators selected by the Lido DAO. stETH represents the user’s staked ETH balance of the beacon chain along with staking rewards accrued or penalties inflicted on validators in the beacon chain. When transactions are enabled on the beacon chain, stETH can be redeemed for unstaked ETH and accumulated rewards.
Unlike beacon chain ETH, stETH can be freely transferred and traded. Onboarding stETH to Aave would allow users to lend and borrow against stETH.
stETH tokens represent a tokenized staking deposit. stETH tokens can be held, traded, or sold. The balance of stETH is based on the total amount of staked ETH plus total staking rewards minus slashing applied on validators.
The stETH supply stands at 71,280 - worth $84.4MM using current stETH prices.
Background
Lido was announced in November 2020. The testnet was released in late November.
Lido staking went live on December 18th after the withdrawal key ceremony ended. Chorus One, Staking Facilities, Certus One, Argent, Banteg (yearn.finance), Alex Svanevik (Nansen), Anton Bukov (1inch), Michael Egorov (Curve/Nucypher), Rune Christensen (MakerDAO), Will Harborne (DeversiFi) and Mustafa Al-Bassam (LazyLedger) came together over a four-day event to generate threshold signatures for Lido’s withdrawal keys in a secure environment on air-gapped machines. Lido will move over to a fully non-custodial solution in the near future.
The Lido DAO manages the liquid staking protocol by deciding on key parameters (e.g. setting fees, assigning node operators and oracles) through the voting power of governance token holders.
Lido has been audited by Sigma Prime and Quantstamp.

stETH Risk Assessment

Summary
Lido allows users to earn staking rewards on the Ethereum beacon chain without locking Ether or maintaining staking infrastructure. This is done through the stETH token. stETH tokens represent a tokenized staking deposit and can be held, traded, or sold.
Onboarding stETH to Aave would allow users to lend and borrow against stETH.

Motivation
There is strong interest in using stETH to earn additional yield with minimal IL risk. This is evident through the growth of the stETH/ETH pool on Curve Finance, which has become the 2nd most liquid pool on Curve with liquidity of $1.8 billion.
The addition of stETH on to Aave can work to attract a larger audience to both Aave and Lido. More ETH staked with Lido would subsequently benefit the decentralization and security of the Ethereum network, to the benefit of the community as a whole. stETH would likely bring new borrow demand to Aave as market participants look to borrow against their staked ETH or lend their stETH for a yield.

stETH Overview
Lido launched in December 2020. Lido allows users to deposit ETH and receive stETH. The deposited ETH is then pooled and staked with node operators selected by the Lido DAO. stETH represents the user’s staked ETH balance of the beacon chain along with staking rewards accrued or penalties inflicted on validators in the beacon chain. When transactions are enabled on the beacon chain, stETH can be redeemed for unstaked ETH and accumulated rewards.
stETH as DeFi collateral is beneficial for a number of reasons.

stETH is almost as safe as ETH, price-wise: barring catastrophic scenarios, its value tends to hold the ETH peg well;
stETH is a productive, yield-generating asset;
stETH is a very liquid asset with over $1.8 billion in liquidity locked in the Curve stETH/ETH pool.

The current stETH supply stands at 309,075 - worth $1.1 billion using current stETH prices. stETH is held by 5,467 unique holders.
The Lido DAO consists of, amongst others, Semantic VC, ParaFi Capital, Libertus Capital, Terra, Bitscale Capital, StakeFish, StakingFacilities, Chorus, P2P Capital and KR1, Stani Kulechov of Aave, Banteg of Yearn, Will Harborne of Deversifi, Julien Bouteloup of Stake Capital and Kain Warwick of Synthetix.
The Lido treasury has been recently diversified and DAO members now include Paradigm, Three Arrows Capital, DeFiance Capital, Jump Trading, Alameda Research, iFinex, Dragonfly Capital, Delphi Digital, Robot Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, Digital Currency Group, The LAO and angels.

Lido has been audited by Sigma Prime, Quantstamp, and MixBytes (see Audit / Relevant Links).

Liquidity & Volumes
stETH is primarily traded on Curve’s stETH/ETH pool.

The pool currently holds $1.8 billion of stETH and ETH.
82.5% of the stETH supply is in the Curve pool.

The price of stETH has remained relatively stable since launch in December 2020 ranging from a low of 0.94 to a high of 1.02 ETH. Initial instability arose due to relatively large withdrawals from Curve which disrupted the peg.
As liquidity in the stETH/ETH pool increased, we have seen more stability in the stETH peg.

Risk Assessment

1280×222


Smart contract risks: C-

Lido faces smart contract risks. To mitigate these, Lido has been successfully audited three times - by Quantstamp, Sigma Prime, and MixBytes (see Audits).

Counterparty risks: C

Lido is a DAO. Decisions in the Lido DAO are made through proposals and votes - community members manage protocol parameters, node operators, oracle members and more. The Lido staking infrastructure for stETH consists of 9 node operators, with a focus on decentralization.
Lido relies on a set of oracles to report staking rewards to the smart contracts. Their maximum possible impact is limited by the recent upgrade, and the operators of oracles are all well-known entities including Stakefish, Certified One, Chorus, Staking Facilities and P2P.

Market risk: B

stETH is the most liquid staked ETH primitive with a $1.1 billion marketcap and $1.8 billion of liquidity in the Curve Finance stETH/ETH pool. 82.5% of the stETH supply is in the Curve pool. The pool facilitated $60MM+ in 24 hour trading volume.

1600×463


Staking risks

stETH faces staking risks, specifically validator risks including slashing and hostage risks. To mitigate these, Lido works only with best-in-class validators with a track record of success. In addition to this, staked ETH with Lido is protected from slashing using the Unslashed Finance insurance protocol. At the time of writing, Lido is covered for 5% slashing on more than 400,000 ETH staked until June 22nd. To date, no slashings have been incurred.

Withdrawal risks

To mitigate withdrawal risks, Lido staking went live on December 18th through a withdrawal key ceremony. Chorus One, Staking Facilities, Certus One, Argent, Banteg (yearn.finance), Alex Svanevik (Nansen), Anton Bukov (1inch), Michael Egorov (Curve/Nucypher), Rune Christensen (MakerDAO), Will Harborne (DeversiFi) and Mustafa Al-Bassam (LazyLedger) came together over a four-day event to generate threshold signatures for Lido’s withdrawal keys in a secure environment on air-gapped machines. Lido plans to move over to a fully non-custodial solution in the near future.

Price feed risk

stETH is not traded on CEXs and thus the oracle has to use the Curve pool price and ETH price feed to determine the current price. Lido is working on its own price feed which is expected to launch in the next 2 weeks. Lido is also working with Chainlink to release an stETH price feed.

Proposed stETH Risk Parameters

LTV: 70%
Liquidation Threshold: 75%
Liquidation Bonus: 5%
Reserve Factor: 10%

A LTV of 70% is slightly higher than the 56% average LTV across non-stablecoin assets and 10% lower than ETH’s 80% LTV. This gives the protocol more room to safely liquidate stETH with a volatility profile similar to ETH.
Interest Rate Model:
UOptimal: 65%
Base: 0%
Slope 1: 8%
Slope 2: 100%

['Proposal: Add Support for stETH (Lido)'],"Thanks for making this proposal! I have a few comments on the proposed risk parameters.
Liquidation ratio
I think 75% may be a bit aggressive. This accommodates for up to an additional ~10% price drop for stETH vs ETH (82.5% liquidation ratio), which may be insufficient under adverse market conditions.
Currently the stETH curve pool has very high liquidity, but this is dependent on users being able to earn excess returns - the LDO + CRV rewards need to be at least 50% of stETH staking rewards or it would be more profitable to hold the assets individually. This creates some risk of changes in rewards allocations from Curve and Lido governance.
If pool liquidity thins out due to lower rewards or higher alternative returns for ETH, it’s possible for liquidations to cause large price impact. This blow out risk becomes relatively more severe as the price discount grows as well, because Curve pools concentrate liquidity around the 1:1 price ratio leaving less liquidity for the tail end of the price spectrum.
Aave doesn’t have the benefit of debt ceilings (although exposure ceiling may be available in the future). Aave is therefore unable to limit market impact directly by limiting debt exposure, and needs to choose liquidation ratios that are sufficiently conservative to liquidate any size position.
I think a 60% max LTV and 65% liquidation ratio would be more appropriate. This would accommodate for up to a 21% price discount vs ETH, which should be enough to incentivize buyers even during a sharp market downturn.
Liquidation bonus
Liquidation bonus needs to be large enough to ensure liquidations are profitable, accounting for gas costs as well as market impact. For small positions, the additional gas required to swap stETH to ETH could be problematic. For larger positions, and particularly if stETH is already trading at a discount (due to the Curve amplification noted above), 5% may not be enough to cover the market impact of immediately dumping stETH back to ETH.
I think a 10% liquidation bonus would be more conservative and safer for the protocol, while having a limited adverse impact on borrowers (as most users manage their position responsibly to avoid liquidation).",56,156.2,2021-05-13

['Proposal: Add Support for stETH (Lido)'],"I’m working on a blogpost with my analysis of stETH stability - expect it to be out end of this week.  TLDR is I think that with liquidity incentives going on we’re going to keep peg tight, and in the absence of them there’s an immense support for stETH between 5 to 25% discount that is really hard to gauge more correctly now.
@aavedegen FDV and market cap are one and the same for stETH.",50,70.0,2021-05-20
['Proposal: Add Support for stETH (Lido)'],"Took a bit more than I thought, but here it is: Concerning stETH Liquidity | Lido Blog
TLDR: When beacon chain withdrawals are enabled, stETH’s liquidity is ensured by the fact it’s possible to unstake and withdraw it with a slight delay. Right now it’s not the case, but stETH is very liquid because the liquidity is incentivized. The incentives will keep on being provided at least until the Merge and withdrawals are enabled, which is expected to happen in less than a year.  Even without incentives, there’s some credible desire to a) MM with stETH b) do a time-based arbitrage for stETH. It’s very hard to predict what that desire would be organically (incentives add a lot of noise to the market data) but different ad-hoc mental models for the market all converge on significant support at a 5-25% discount.",51,70.2,2021-05-26

['ARC: Liquidation Bonus Updates 2021-09-14'],"
Simple Summary
A proposal to reduce the liquidation bonus for eleven (11) Aave V2 assets.

Abstract
This proposal is an extension on the previous ARC for liquidation bonus updates and the corresponding AIP-34: Liquidation Bonus Updates that followed. Besides reserve factor changes, no risk parameter values have been updated since the launch of Aave V2. Gauntlet’s simulations output initially targeted liquidation bonus values lower than we recommended. Over the past 10 days we have been able to monitor liquidator behavior and have reached higher confidence in further reductions.

Motivation
The updated liquidation bonuses fared very well since AIP execution on 2021-09-04. The liquidation bonus changes impacted about $7M USD worth of liquidations across 21 users. Despite small changes, a bit over $100k USD was saved for those users (mostly in WBTC and SUSHI). Additionally, no additional insolvencies were recorded after the 18% one day drop in ETH price.

I’m posting here to inquire about a collaborative yield farm or general public support from the Aave ecosystem. Sperax is launching a $20M yield farming campaign and will be funneling all deposited assets into Aave as it is the most censorship resistant protocol available to satisfy our lending needs on Arbitrum One.

Summary
Sperax USD is a hybrid stablecoin that is mostly backed by explicit, protocol-owned collateral, and partially by algorithm. Sperax USD uses ETF/Tether style arbitrage to ensure tight peg at $1. This keeps the price of USDs in a tight band around $1.00, offering users the stability benefits of explicit collateral stablecoins with the scalability benefit of algorithmic stablecoins.
Collateral in the protocol is sent to Aave markets to earn a return. We believe that the launch of our liquidity incentives for USDs will cause at least $15M in liquidity to be deposited into Aave.
About the LM campaign
Through our mobile app, Sperax Play, we are onboarding our 500k users into our stablecoin and we don’t wake them to suffer from slippage. Customers will be transferring from centralized exchanges with size, and want to easily transfer from their stablecoins or major assets to USDs.
To ensure there is adequate liquidity, we will be allocating 400M SPA from the bootstrapping liquidity budget to compensate early market makers for their generous contribution to the Sperax ecosystem. With their help we will be able to service the masses by offering a service comparable to their traditional banking system with 10x better rewards.
Positioning within Aave Ecosystem
Sperax believes the Sperax USD protocol, in combination with the Sperax Play mobile front end app, can act as a conduit for Southeast Asian community to onboard into defi. The Sperax community is very active and looking for venues ways to interact with the crypto and defi ecosystem in a fun, user friendly way. As we expand Sperax Play’s financial service offerings, Sperax outsources the borrow and lend service to Aave for all approved assets. We will list the rates offered, with a “powered by Aave” logo next to it.
Project History
Sperax was launched in late 2019. The project is currently using snapshot voting for governance. The project is working with Compound governance contracts to begin the transition to a fully functional, decentralized DAO.

['Aave Guardian Update'],"
Update (Sept 24)
We have an amazing set of candidates for the Aave Guardian. We want to move the process faster to deploy Aave Protocol on Avalanche. Interested candidates should respond to this post by 10 am UTC on Saturday, Sept 25. After this, we will put up a Snapshot vote for the community to elect 10 Guardian members.

Summary

Allow the Guardian to temporarily hold keys of new deployments of the Aave Protocol on L2 (or otherwise) while the technical implementations for Aave Governance to control such deployment on those networks is finalized (i.e., a protocol governance bridge).
Rel-elect 10 members of the Aave Guardian. If you are interested in being a member of Aave Guardian, please respond to this post with your background, involvement in Aave, and interest in the role.


Proposer
@HelloShreyas and Aave Grants DAO

Rationale
What Is the Guardian:
As discussed here, the Guardian was established as a community multisig to protect against potential governance takeovers by centralized actors.
It was always intended that Aave governance would replace the current members through a vote, but no such proposal for this replacement vote has been made to date. Given the community’s interest in ensuring deployments of the Aave Protocol on various other networks (e.g., Polygon) and that bridges must be built from bridges to Aave governance, we believe it is an ideal time for governance to elect new Guardian members to be part of the Guardian multisig.
Enhanced responsibilities of the Guardian:
Currently, the Guardian only is intended to act as a “veto” on malicious attacks on the Aave Protocol through governance votes by centralized actors.
However, the Guardian — comprised of community members — also should have the ability to hold the admin keys to any new deployment of the Aave Protocol on other networks while technical solutions are being built to ensure that Aave Governance can control all deployments of the protocol, regardless of the network on which they’re running.
This additional responsibility is necessary because governance bridge infrastructure (i.e., cross-chain governance smart contracts) to control the Aave Protocol on other networks may not be ready at deployment time. Any deployment of the requires an Ethereum address to hold certain permissions on the pool, to later on be transferred to the Aave Governance on Ethereum. Considering that the Aave community actively supports expansion of the protocol to other networks, it will be useful for all future deployments to have a community multi-sig composed by reputable members of the Aave community as holders of the different permissions of the deployment.
New Members:
There are currently 10 members of the Guardian multisig, but we would like to re-elect all 10 positions from among the community. If existing members want to be part of the multisig, they need to re-apply.
We believe community members should come forward to express their interest in being a member of the Guardian multisig and should make a case for why they are well-situated to take on this role.
Any community member can respond publicly to this forum post to express interest in taking on this role. Please share your background, your involvement with Aave, and why you would be a fit for this responsibility. The community member should also provide a proposal regarding their ability and interest in being a member of the Guardian multisig.
To encourage censorship resistance we recommend the community to not have more than 3 key holders from the same jurisdiction.
Process for voting in New Guardian Members:
Once all proposals for new Guardian members have been submitted, the Grants DAO will publish a Snapshot highlighting interested members and providing background on the proposal submitted by those individuals.
Governance can then vote to elect the next members of the Guardian through the Snapshot.",84,3541.6,2021-09-24

Around 2.5 years ago I have unfortunatly sent some big amount of Lend tokens to the
Lend contract address. It was my fault of course and I absolutely accept that, but the thought of maybe
one day returning the tokens stayed.
I understand that there was nothing Aave team could have done since the Lend contract
didn’t have the technical possibility to send the tokens back (the bounce function I believe),
but right now, while the migration is in the process maybe the team could think of
a way to reimburse the tokens back to the owners accounts in a form of Aave, as if they were swapped.
Since the tokens are lost in the contract forever but are still
the part of the circulation supply there would be no harm in returning them back
in accordance to the Lend > Aave swap rules. The contract itself holds around 839 863 lend.
So if the tech team could consider something - it would be wonderful and much appreciated!

Summary:
The STASIS team would like to submit a proposal to onboard EURS.

EURS Background
EURS is the largest euro-backed digital asset, combining the benefits of the world’s second most-traded currency with the transparency, immutability, and efficiency of the distributed ledger technology. Created by stablecoin crypto-enabler platform STASIS, EURS mirrors the euro’s value on the blockchain and is supported by assurance mechanisms provided via an ecosystem of liquidity providers, custodians, exchanges, payment platforms, and others. Each token is backed 1:1 by euros held in the company’s reserve accounts.
STASIS is a platform focused on transparency with a solid track record and vast expertise in technological, financial, and legal fields (1). Since all EURS are backed with fiat euro, there is no risk for investors and everyday users, who can always exchange their digital assets thanks to the Sellback Service (2).
EURS stablecoin combines experience, trust, technology, and financial infrastructure to enable business growth, narrowing the gap between the European financial and the digital asset markets. This in-house solution utilizes multi-blockchain interoperability to shortcut financial inefficiencies, often present in old-school financial systems. The project has popular global social media accounts and multiple local communities in different countries and a diverse investor base that includes institutions.
Since USD-backed stable coins are heavily dominating the market, Europeans/Asians are often forced into undesired dollar exposure with little on-chain hedging options. EURS stablecoin seeks to challenge the U.S. Dollar’s dominance in global financial markets. By 2021 it has become a popular tool for daily transactions, free of risks and volatility inherent in conventional cryptocurrencies. The potential of stablecoins use cases has been recognized in times of crisis, and the demand for EURS is growing steadily in the DeFi field.
Community and Communication
STASIS is active on Telegram, Twitter, Facebook and has established accounts in most popular crypto social media. The project team also operates and regularly updates a YouTube account (4). STASIS and EURS are often mentioned in global press media (5). Gregory Klumov, the founder and CEO of the STASIS EURS project, is the project’s main spokesperson (6), often sharing his view on crypto. The STASIS website includes a mailing address in lsle of Man, and a contact e-mail (7). There is also a phone number provided.
Benefits for AAVE:


A new gateway for European and Asian users into the emerging DeFi world.


EURS will be the largest non-dollar fiat stablecoin on the AAVE protocol.


Increased adoption of AAVE by the EURS userbase.


EURS tokens are backed 1-1 with EURO FIAT, meaning there is no risk for users who operate with it since they can always exchange their assets to EURO thanks to the STASIS Sellback service which has been recently improved.


EURS smart contract has been upgraded by ABDK — the company behind the audit of the V3 Uniswap which is the largest DeFi protocol nowadays. This gives the protocol and users a guarantee of confidence in the product.

Next, when it comes to regulations, we need to note here that STASIS is exempt from regulation under Maltese laws and the VFA act. STASIS has received 4 legal opinions from Malta, the USA, UK, Germany to confirm this position.

2,200 stkAAVE per day will be allocated pro-rata across supported markets based on the dollar value of the borrowing activity in the underlying market. stkAAVE was distributed over AAVE to further align users with the Aave Protocol and increase the amount of AAVE staked in the safety module.

Liquidity Mining Recap


Value Distributed: During the liquidity mining campaign, 198,000 stkAAVE will be distributed to borrowers and lenders on Aave v2, using ~7% of the Ecosystem Reserve. This equates to $82MM in rewards (AAVE VWAP since LM program started).


TVL: v2 TVL rose from $7.8 billion to a high of $14.4 billion in mid-May. Stablecoin liquidity accounts for more than 60% of total Aave v2 liquidity.


V1 to V2 liquidity migration: v1 liquidity decreased from $2.5 billion to $372MM since the liquidity mining program started. 40% of Aave liquidity was deployed in v1 before the LM rewards started. Aave v1 liquidity now accounts for less than 3% of all liquidity on Aave. This allows the community to remain focused on v2 and upcoming money markets.


Growth in dollar value supplied and borrowed: The USDC and DAI markets experienced the largest increase in dollar value supplied and borrowed. Note - many users on these markets have recursively levered their position to maximize yields. Recursive leverage accounts for ~32% of all deposits on v2. This compares to ~40% on Aave’s Polygon market.


Reserve Growth: Aave reserves help provide the first layer of protection for borrowers and lenders. Since liquidity mining rewards launched, Aave’s v2 reserves have grown by ~$7MM.


Change in v2 markets from 4/26/21 to 7/15/21

Liquidity Mining v2
In v2 of the liquidity mining proposal, we propose the following:

Keep the same 2,200 stkAAVE per day distribution. Over a one year period, this equates to 803k stkAAVE distributed or ~27% of the ecosystem reserve.
Include LINK in the liquidity mining program. We have seen close collaboration between the LINK and AAVE communities. The Aave community signaled support for adding LINK.
We propose the Aave Risk DAO explore a separate shorter-term liquidity mining proposal for new assets. For example, this program would allow newly onboarded assets to benefit from LM rewards. This program would facilitate shorter and targeted LM distributions.
Update the LM distribution - applying the same, formulaic approach to current borrowing demand on Aave v2 as of 7/15/21. Note - this distribution does not adjust for recursive leverage. While this distribution allocates a relatively low amount of stkAAVE to the LINK market, this number can be scaled up over time. Similar to other markets, current borrowing demand is used to determine the allocation of stkAAVE to the LINK market.


We would love to hear the community’s feedback on these parameters.

['ARC: Extend AAVE Liquidity Mining Rewards'],"I fully support the extension of the liquidity mining program. It has been highly successfully in attracting deposits and borrowing activity for the Aave protocol, ultimately resulting in Aave becoming the largest DeFi protocol by TVL. The addition of LINK is also appreciated and makes since in my mind given the community support showcased by this ARC to add LM rewards for LINK back in May. My rational regarding adding LM rewards for LINK deposits and the synergies between the Chainlink and Aave communities can be read in that ARC.
However as you noted, I do think the rewards allocated to LINK are too low. With ~$311M of LINK currently deposited and ~$8.5M borrowed on Aave v2, implementing 4 stkAAVE per day in LM rewards (considering a USD value of $250 per stkAAVE), which is split 95% to depositors and 5% to borrowers (similar to WBTC and ETH), would result in a LM reward APR of 0.1% for LINK deposits and 0.2% for borrowers.
In comparison, Compound’s LM program currently offers 2.22% APY for LINK deposits and 14.52% for borrowing (although to note the collateral factor is currently 0%). As Compound turns up the collateral factor to allow borrowing against LINK though, Aave may become less competitive within the LINK token borrowing/lending/collateralization market. Therefore, I believe the current allocation for LINK LM rewards would have a negligible effect on attracting activity for LINK versus competitors (who now also use Chainlink price feeds making it a viable option).
Generally, I think it makes sense to determine LM rewards for stablecoins by looking at the amount borrowed, but I don’t think this approach works for non-stablecoins as most people use non-stablecoins like LINK as collateral to borrow stablecoins. Really the only reason to borrow LINK is to short it, which is not a common activity, especially for the Chainlink community which is the targeted audience for attracting LINK deposits (which would lead to greater amount of stablecoins being borrowed and higher yield for stablecoin lenders).
I propose increasing the LM rewards for LINK one order of magnitude from 4 stkAAVE per day to 40 stkAAVE per day which would put the allocation on a similar level with ETH and WBTC, resulting in an APR of 1% for depositing and 2% for borrowing, which is more competitive. Open to discussion, particularly how the rewards would be rebalanced from other markets or if the aggregate allocation as a whole is increased. Thank you for creating this proposal and listening to my point of view.",116,63.2,2021-07-17
['ARC: Extend AAVE Liquidity Mining Rewards'],"I support continuing LM and this proposal.
Aave’s usage has increased a lot, fees are accruing much more quickly to the ecosystem collector, and rates are lower and more stable, making Aave more attractive to borrowers than before LM was instantiated.
To @ChainLinkGod point, perhaps the proposed rewards to LINK are on the low side, but given that current LM program is going to end soon (25th july), I think the priority would be to have it proposed in a timeline where aave voters have the chance to enact LM without interruption if they want to.
But it’s an interesting point. Maybe this could see a further proposal in the future to change the way rewards allocation work for non-stablecoins. For example there could be research on calculating how much borrowing activity happens using certain non-stablecoins collaterals, and allocate rewards based on that?",99,84.6,2021-07-17
['ARC: Extend AAVE Liquidity Mining Rewards'],"Hello @Anjan-ParaFi , thanks for starting the discussion !
I voted no because i don’t think the LM program should continue this way, but I’m not saying we should stop it either.
I agree about the fact that the TVL and the revenues have grown since the beginning of the program, however, this also lowered the security of Aave by diluting the safefy module, which led to less borrow covered by the SM than before.
The preoccupation of a downside pressure was mentioned in the comments of the first proposal, and the price action shows that’s what happened. If we look at the price evolution between the start of the LM and today, AAVE price is down 30% (and 63% from ATH) which means the value of the ecosystem reserve and the safety module lost around 30% value too.
If we look at the chart, the LM program started on April 25th, the first cooldown call was possible on Mai 5th. We can observe a first dump on the 4th (probably anticipation) then a small downtrend until Mai 11th. It could be simply because the program just started but AAVE token has reached an ATH of 660$ only 24 days after the launch of the LM. Surely the all market is going down and the LM is obviously not the only reason of the dump, but it’s probably a part of it.
It would be very interesting to get some statistics about cool downs activation on this period although it’s very possible that a lot of users sold their StkAave on Uniswap directly, bringing a potential slippage on the pool in order to avoid the cooldown period.
The main goal of the ecosystem reserve is to be used for the protocol outflow until it generates enough revenues to cover everything that’s paid by the DAO.
I think spending as much as almost 1/3 of the ER in only one year could lead to a lot more downside, hurting even more the reserve treasury, the safety module and the token holders.
Also, does it really make sense to distribute twice more rewards to stakers who take risks to cover the protocol than to liquidity providers (even if the risk remains low) ? Especially considering that the rewards are in StkAave, which dilute even more the StkAave yield.
One potential solution could be to start the next program with Aave tokens instead of StkAave (considering that the cool down period does not reduce the dump), add a linear vesting for the farming rewards, with a lower distribution and even if Aave should continue to stablecoins on V2, it could also targeting specifics markets/assets, which could help regulate/lower the selling pressure.
Another possibility for the liquidity mining could be to start an incentive on a 50/50 pool on Polygon (could be a double reward with sushi, quickswap on balancer) to help maintain the price when there is some big market movements. As the LTV on Aave is only 50%, it’s probably one of the assets liquidated the most. An attractive pool like this also remove the cool-down constraint and the high gas fees with it for small wallets, bringing more liquidity.
There is an issue remaining, not directly related to this proposal but StkBPT holders still can’t vote, that’s around 1M of Aave (6.25% of the total supply) token that can’t take part to the protocol decisions. This needs to be implemented as soon as possible imo.
Moreover, at the time of the first proposal, Aave holders on Polygon were not able to vote either, so I’m glad they can now.
Finally, about the first proposal, even if the poll passed, we see on the comments that a majority of known community members were against it (16 Against, 6 For and 5 uncertain / 27 comments on an opinion about the LM proposal)
I hope these community members will take part to the discussion as I would be happy to know if some of them changed their mind about this.

['ARC: Extend AAVE Liquidity Mining Rewards'],"During the discussions regarding the first wave of liquidity mining, I’ve expressed my concerns regarding the use of non-targeted incentives, especially on the borrowing side. I’ve also noted that it would create recursive loops on Aave, and dilute the efficiency of the Safety Module budget since borrowing skyrocketed.
I recognize the success of the first wave of liquidity mining, it helped tremendously to grow Aave’s awareness and utilization. However, we must note that the AAVE token has not performed that well in the meantime, lowering even further the effective Safety Module budget. I’m also still looking for a documented analysis of the behaviors of the farmers who received the Ecosystem Reserve tokens: do they unstake? what’s the 1/2/3 months StkAave retention rate?
Given that Aave is now the most prominent money market, I strongly oppose any non-targeted liquidity mining program such as @Anjan-ParaFi suggests.
If the community would like to move forward with this, I would suggest at least revising the proposal to consider the following adjustments, inspired from the discussions on the first wave:


Budget: The current proposal suggests using more than ¼ of the Ecosystem Reserve over the course of a mere year simply for growth. I find it almost indecent to even suggest something like that. I see Aave as base layer, here for decades to come. Growth-focused spending should not be this excessive.


Profitability: As Anjan highlighted, Aave’s reserves have grown by about $7M. It’s a neat achievement but let’s not forget to place it back into its context. We’ve pulled ~ 200K AAVE so far from the Ecosystem Reserve to sustain the liquidity mining ~ 52 M $ at present price.


Gamification: Could we adjust or skew the reward in favor of users maintaining a responsible health factor? There could be bonus for sustaining a >1.8 HF for prolonged periods for instance. We could also skew the StkAave allocation to in favor of users who stay staked into the Safety Module with the tokens they earned.


Borrow-side incentives: do we actually need them? What are we trying to accomplish with this? We must note that the introduction of borrowing incentives created a recursive usage of Aave that was almost non existent before and now represents ~1/3 of the TVL.


Proposition framing & objectives: What are our objectives with this liquidity mining plan? Numbah go up? Even we’re this basic, I think there should be some form of common understanding of what we are trying to achieve and how success will be measured – especially if we spend the sizable amount of AAVE initially suggested.


Proposed tokens: while I understand the potential need for incentives on stablecoin deposits given the competitiveness of this market and its critical need for Aave, we can wonder if we need incentives for established tokens like ETH or wBTC that were already abundantly used as collateral on Aave without liquidity mining rewards.


Duration: liquidity mining is great to make capital flow quickly. Why not harness this to help launch new markets/tokens with limited 1-2 week mining plan?


Given that this proposal seem to already have the team support before the community discussion even happened, I don’t think this message will produce any result, but allow me to try one more time.

Over a year, it is 1/4 of the ecosystem reserve, but it’s actually only 1/20 of the total market supply. If the goal is decentralization of the protocol, this is actually pretty slow in my opinion.

Isn’t the core value offered by AAVE realized by the process of borrowing though? I think pushing users to a higher health factor is the wrong approach to prevent things like insolvency to the protocol. The user should feel comfortable taking as much of a risk as the AAVE protocol lets them which means that real solutions need to focus on getting positions liquidated on time and seting liquidation parameters appropriately.

You point out recursive borrowing, but I’m not really sure why that would be a bad thing. I think it’s wonderful that people can take whale-like positions with small amounts of capital as long as the liquidation mechanics are solid. Overall, I think it should be AAVE’s goal to invite users to play with as much liquidity as the protocol allows. If we think things are too risky, AAVE should adjust the liquidation parameters.

dilute the efficiency of the Safety Module budget


I don’t believe this is really true, the Safety Module is backed by users staking their AAVE (currently $746M of AAVE has been staked, which 30% ($233M) can be used during a downfall event) and AAVE/ETH Balancer pool shares (currently $260M of AAVE and $65M of ETH, where 30% ($97.5M) can be used during a downfall event). This means the Safety Module already has $330M in funds that can be used to recollateralize the system if any significant undercollateralized loans are created on the platform (which has never happened but the SM provides additional protection). Even if this entire budget was used up, the Aave protocol can issuance new AAVE tokens to cover any holes (just like MKR in the MakerDAO protocol like during black thursday).
“In case the SM is not able to cover all of the deficit incurred, the Protocol Governance can trigger an ad-hoc Recovery Issuance event. In such a scenario, new AAVE is issued and sold in an open auction for market price prioritizing the Backstop Module.” - Safety Module Documentation



 TokenBrice:

However, we must note that the AAVE token has not performed that well in the meantime, lowering even further the effective Safety Module budget.


As shown above, LM programs do not reduce the Safety Module budget and the reason we have seen a decrease in the value of the AAVE token cannot really be attributed to the LM program (at least I have seen no evidence of such), but more than likely because the entire crypto market has crashed since the LM program started (BTC has gone from $60k to $30k), all cryptos are highly correlated and AAVE has dropped a similar amount.



 TokenBrice:

Given that Aave is now the most prominent money market, I strongly oppose any non-targeted liquidity mining program such as @Anjan-ParaFi suggests.


Aave has become the prominent money market precisely because it has a liquidity mining program that incentivizes adoption. If the community wants it to keep it that way, it needs to stay competitive against other money markets like Compound that have such LM programs. Seeing success and cutting the LM program in my mind is like a patient who stops taking their anti-biotics because they feel better and thinks they don’t need them anymore. Without such a program, TVL will drop and this position will be lost against competitors like Compound and even Cream when they launch a LM program.

Incentivizing low capital efficiency of loans results in lower yields for lenders, especially for larger positions (seems people would be more likely to borrow less rather than deposit more collateral). The Aave system has proven it can handle market crashes and keep the protocol collateralized. I don’t think this is really necessary as users should be able to open positions within their risk tolerance and not be disincentived from opening capital efficient positions that the protocol can handle, then would likely switch to other platforms like Compound that don’t have such a dynamic.



 TokenBrice:

Borrow-side incentives : do we actually need them? What are we trying to accomplish with this? We must note that the introduction of borrowing incentives created a recursive usage of Aave that was almost non existent before and now represents ~1/3 of the TVL.


Money markets are a two sided marketplace. Incentivizing borrowing increases yield for lenders (particularly stablecoins), which incentivizes more deposits to capture these yields (e.g. from users and protocols like Yearn), thereby lowering rates for borrowers, increasing borrowing activity, leading to higher lending rates, and repeat. This creates a virtuous cycle which cannot be achieved by only incentivizing deposits, which would crush yields, disincentivizing deposits, not ideal for a two-sided marketplace.

To incentivize adoption and usage, as well as get users to switch from Aave v1 and other markets like Compound over to Aave. Goals were defined in the original LM program proposal, which haven’t changed, which is likely why it isn’t in this proposal. Quantifying such metrics would indeed help but I think the goals are clear: market dominance.



 TokenBrice:

Proposed tokens : while I understand the potential need for incentives on stablecoin deposits given the competitiveness of this market and its critical need for Aave, we can wonder if we need incentives for established tokens like ETH or wBTC that were already abundantly used as collateral on Aave without liquidity mining rewards.


If Aave wants to stay competitive against other markets like Compound who offers LM rewards for such collateral, then yes. LM rewards incentivize people to switch their loan positions from other platforms to Aave and incentivizes people who don’t use money markets to start using them. As a two sided marketplace, deposits and borrows should both be incentivized.

I feel this ignores the all of the people who have publicly supported such LM programs like myself and others, who see the competitive advantages that such LM programs provide. This proposal wasn’t created by the Aave team but a community member, so not sure where this assumption comes from. This proposal was created to get community feedback such as yours.
I agree with many of your other points regarding adding other tokens to the program and recursive borrowing (although this doesn’t really introduce risks, just is capital not being used efficiently, not sure what the solution here would be as we need to incentivize both sides of a two sided marketplace to get that virtuous cycle that has lead to Aave becoming the #1 protocol by TVL).
I would be interested in seeing some of the metrics quantified from the data we now have from the previous LM program like the retention rate and number/percentage of people switching platforms versus using money markets for the first time. In general, a LM program enshrines Aave’s position as the largest money market which is more important during its early life (which justifies such capital usage) compared than later when it has a greater network effect through liquidity and integrations.",70,84.0,2021-07-18
['ARC: Extend AAVE Liquidity Mining Rewards'],"Loving the discussion here!
I’m mostly in accordance with @pakim249 and @ChainLinkGod on the topic. I think that the current Liquidity Mining program has been essential to drive Aave at the top of the rankings across liquidity protocols, and it’s too early to stop now. Especially as all the farming opportunities dried up, liquidity now concentrates, of course, in protocols that provide long term, valuable governance power redistribution (that’s why curve climbed the TVL rankings so quickly).
What i personally care about is long term sustainability of the protocol and ecosystem growth. I see liquidity mining propaedeutic to both (growth of the ecosystem reserve thanks to the increased outstanding debt and leading market metrics).
I usually avoid talking about price but since it looks like is the concern of many, will give my personal opinion - i don’t see strong correlation between the current AAVE price and the LM program. Aave reached the ATH way after the LM program had begun and we can’t ignore the fact that the market dropped 50+% and there is strong correlation between assets.
The aave reserve is on it’s way to collect 30M+ in stablecoins by the end of the year. That’s a multiyear runaway for protocol development and ecosystem growth, and even at the current market APY of aroun 2% it would generate 600+K/year out of interest only (the stablecoins collected by the aave reserve are automatically deposited in Aave).
As a community we need to aim long term, the future of finance will play out in the next 10 years and the aave protocol will be the leader.",59,96.6,2021-07-18

It reminds me of Paypal 20$ referral program when they first started, it seemed expensive at the time but it got them their first few million users and where they are today.

['ARC: Extend AAVE Liquidity Mining Rewards'],"Glad to see the message stirred some reactions and was not ignored this time.
I want to focus on clarifying an absolutely critical point that seems deeply misunderstood in this discussion, what I call the dilution of the safety module budget.
Ignore AAVE price going down, since indeed it’s not directly correlated to the liquidity mining. Even consider that the deposit to the safety module stayed the same (they lowered).
The safety module is to be used in case of critical failure, so we measure its effective coverage against the borrow side of Aave. I did the maths in February when I published my risk assessment article:

image1014×449 61.8 KB

Let’s redo the maths for today’s situation, all in USD:

Safety Module Total Deposit = $ 1.05B
Budget that can be used (30%) = $350M
Total Borrows on V1 + V2 = 56 M + 6.3 B
Effective coverage offered by the safety module = 16.6%, roughly 3.5x times less that the figure observed in February.

This is precisely what I meant by “dilution of the safety module budget”. Even if the budget stays the same, it got diluted by the massive increase in borrowing. This is the main reason why I’m worried about borrowing side incentives as it’s essentially driving a reduction of efficiency of the insurance budget — especially if nothing is done to stimulate deposits to the SM simultaneously.
To clarify the rest of my points, allow me to restate that I do not oppose liquidity mining per se, and I recognized the results of the first wave. What I oppose is the untargeted dimension (both sides, all major tokens) & the excessive budget, amongst other concerns.",68,658.6,2021-07-19
['ARC: Extend AAVE Liquidity Mining Rewards'],"Thanks for all the great input! Aligned with @ChainLinkGod, @pakim249, and @Emilio.
@ChainLinkGod Fair points on the allocation towards the LINK market. 4 stkAAVE is relatively low, but this can also be seen as a starting point before scaling rewards up further. LINK would be the first asset added to the program. Once added, we can monitor borrow/lend activity and further refine. On new assets in general, the risk DAO may be best positioned to add/remove assets in a scalable process.

Taking into account the flexibility of Snapshot, sounds the most natural next step.
In what rewards the temporary extension, I’m also in favour, as:

The current liquidity mining is quite neutral and can be sustained for 4 weeks by the Aave DAO treasury without problem.

['Aave Risk Dashboard by Gauntlet Launched'],"Hi Folks!
Over the last couple of months, the Gauntlet team has been building the Aave Risk Dashboard. We are happy to announce that the Aave Risk Dashboard is now live at gov.gauntlet.network/aave!! We are very excited to release this dashboard to the community and start to gather feedback so we can continue to iterate on it and maximize its impact.
A few high level points/reminders:

There are two goals for the initial dashboard launch: a) help the community understand our methodology and recommendations and b) help the community understand how Gauntlet’s recommendations help reduce risk and increase capital efficiency for the protocol.

Value at Risk (VaR) and Borrow Usage (BU) are topline measures of Risk and Capital Efficiency respectively. VaR conveys capital at risk due to insolvencies and liquidations when markets are under duress (i.e. Black Thursday). We currently compute VaR (based on a measure of protocol insolvency) at the 95th percentile of our simulation runs assuming higher than normal volatility. Borrow Usage is defined in detail in this post.
You may notice VaR being $0 for quite a few assets. This is due to the fact that these assets do not represent a significant portion of Aave’s borrow positions and that liquidator agents prefer large positions due to higher guarantees on making a profit. This leads to no liquidations or insolvencies happening in our sims for the smaller assets and positions in Aave.
We have removed the historical VaR and Borrow Usage charts from the initial version of the dashboard, as we need a bit more time to backfill market data and test. We expect to launch the charts in a few weeks.
To get an even more in depth understanding of our methodology for running Simulations take a look at our Aave report. In particular, Section 4.3 and Appendix Section C. While we have updated the actual data underlying the sims, the methodology remains relevant.

With the Dashboard, we are excited about making the Aave protocol safer and more capital efficient. With the most recent round of parameter changes being proposed in AIP-38, we are able to reduce Value at Risk by $7.68M, while maintaining the same level of Borrow Usage! By reducing Liquidation Bonuses we are able to reduce the chance of cascading liquidations and thus reduce potential borrower losses, making the Aave protocol safer overall. Going forward we plan on keeping the dashboard up-to-date with the current state of the Aave protocol and our recommended parameter changes.
This is just the start of our Risk Dashboard product for Aave and we plan on refining it with the community. Feel free to give feedback in the comments here, or directly to us using the Send Feedback button on the dashboard!

Introduction
This document is intended to outline objectives, constraints, and governance mechanisms for the Aave treasury. It will serve as a strategic guide that:

Plans for appropriate asset allocation and implementation (e.g. governance, constraints, manager selection).
Establishes accountability.
Offers an objective course of action to be followed during periods of market disruption when instinctive responses might lead to less prudent actions.

Having a governance document like this is vital to the success of the capital management program of a DAO. Since they are typically less structured and decision-making is community-driven, having guidelines can help the community assess new strategic decisions based on already agreed upon terms. This proposal will serve as the initial draft, but it should be noted that it is a living document, subject to change with the circumstances of the Aave treasury. It should be viewed as a guide of best practices, and amendments should be adopted by the community prior to making a capital decision in order to ensure the framework is properly considered.

Definition and Structure
These guidelines govern the investments associated with the Aave Protocol. It shall apply to the assets tracked by the Dune Dashboard here.
The Aave community is responsible for approval of and updates to this forum post. It is recommended that the Aave community maintain a DAO/Working Group/Committee dedicated to issues related to these guidelines, including identifying the need for updates and monitoring the portfolio of assets/strategies for compliance with these guidelines.

Governance
The Aave Treasury Management Committee (TMC) should meet quarterly to review these guidelines in light of prevailing circumstances. At these quarterly meetings, an opportunity should be made for the community to propose changes to these guidelines.
The TMC will be responsible for proposing policies to the Aave community that are suitable for achieving the strategic objectives listed below. When necessary, the TMC can identify and engage with outside advisors to help on strategic proposals, review the investment policies, and make recommendations to the community.
In order to keep the community apprised of the performance of the TMC, regular reporting on the investments held by the treasury will be provided. A monthly accounting of positions, calculation of performance relative to any applicable benchmarks, and any additional information necessary to inform the community members of the treasury’s progress will be made.

Investment Objective
The investment assets of the Aave Treasury are intended to:

Preserve capital and fund ecosystem growth.
Generate a total return sufficient to preserve the protocol in any market environment.
Reduce the idiosyncratic risk of the concentrated AAVE position while maintaining exposure to the upside of the protocol.

To fulfill these objectives over the long term, the investment portfolio should seek to achieve a total rate of return in excess of operational expenses. This will ensure protocol longevity, provide flexibility on operations, and protect the purchasing power of the Protocol’s assets.

Time Horizon
The Aave Protocol, like other institutional investors (e.g. pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments, foundations), has an infinite time horizon. The Treasury exists to serve the Aave ecosystem in perpetuity.
The investments held by the Aave Treasury should be made with a long-term perspective. As such, short-term investment performance shortfalls are not necessarily of critical interest unless they suggest failures in strategy execution.

Liquidity Constraints
The Aave Treasury’s liquidity constraints will be subject to ongoing operational expenses. As a best practice, it is recommended that the total allocation to illiquid investments (e.g. token lock-ups) remain below 50% of the investment portfolio, in line with the average endowment allocation to illiquid alternative investments. We would expect illiquidity to remain much lower than this maximum given the nature of DeFi.
In addition, we would recommend that at least 10% of the value of the treasury should be invested in assets that can be quickly liquidated without any significant adverse impact in value as a result of the liquidation (e.g. stablecoins).

Leverage Constraints
Since one of the goals of the Aave treasury is to maintain concentration in the native governance token, strategies will likely employ debt by borrowing stablecoins and other assets against AAVE. For this reason, it is necessary to identify specific metrics for managing risk when deploying leverage.


Health Factor - Health Factor is crucial when determining liquidation risk. The Aave treasury should elect to manage any investment with a conservative Health Factor that has a very low chance of liquidation during periods of market volatility. A target health factor band will be presented with each investment proposal along with specific capital management practices necessary to ensure the Health Factor is maintained during a range of market conditions.

Interest Coverage Ratio - Ideally all strategies are positive carry. However, each strategy will be considered both in isolation and holistically within a broader portfolio.

Derivatives - The use of derivatives is intended to balance out the overall risk exposure of the portfolio. For example, hedging the downside risk of the Aave position with a put option could lower liquidation risk in the event of a severe downturn.


Metagovernance
Where possible, the Aave Treasury should exert the right to contribute to the value of Aave’s investments by participating in constituent protocol governance. The TMC will advise the community on metagovernance proposals when particularly applicable to the value of the Treasury’s investments.

Risk Management
The risk management framework for the Aave treasury will be considered holistically. Capital management decisions will take into consideration various external risks that any treasury faces, along with those external risks specific to the crypto ecosystem. In this section, a risk overview is provided along with a framework for managing both DeFi-specific and portfolio management related risks.

Risk Overview


Credit Risk - This type of risk is specific to off-chain collateralized stablecoins but can also be present anytime there are assets being delegated to or managed by a counterparty. We intend to perform internal monitoring specific to any credit risks that may arise during the treasury management process.

Market Risk - Market risk is inherent in any investment that trades freely on secondary markets. As discussed in the portfolio construction section, market risk will be managed within the portfolio construction framework with the goal of working toward the strategic asset allocation outlined below.

Liquidity Risk - Liquidity can be a risk during periods of network congestion or in the event liquidity is needed but not available for operational expenses. Thorough liquidity analysis will be performed when determining if a strategy is suitable for the Aave treasury.

Infrastructural Risk - Crypto assets have varying levels of infrastructural risks related to the Ethereum network and smart contracts. When the Ethereum network is clogged during periods of volatility or use, an asset may lose its liquidity since transactions cannot be processed in a timely manner or may be cost-prohibitive. Smart contract exploits (e.g., inflation of the stablecoin via exploitation of a minting function), use of admin keys, oracle risk, and more can all destroy the value of an asset.


Identifying and Managing DeFi-Specific Risk
In addition to the broad risks outlined above, there are also DeFi-specific risks to assess and manage when deciding on allocating capital to a particular strategy. Below are some DeFi-specific risks along with recommendations on handling them:


Smart Contract - This risk is well known within crypto and the most widely accepted measure for measuring this risk is the combination of a high Total Value Locked (TVL) in the contract for an extended duration of time. This acts much like a bounty as a reward for anyone who can drain the funds. Past performance of similar contracts can be used as a proxy for assessing risk. Audits mitigate some risks and insurance can offset financial loss at a price.

Admin Keys by protocols - Ideally, the treasury should steer clear of any protocol with admin keys. The only time it’s really acceptable is early on in a protocol’s life. If a protocol has admin keys, there should be a timelock in place before changes made by admins go into effect to limit potential risks.

Oracle Risk - Widely trusted and proven oracle feeds are strongly preferred. Oracle exploit is one of the most frequent exploits within DeFi. We would want to ensure any investment that utilizes (particularly derivatives) oracles are set up with secure price feeds/data. For example, an options protocol using an ETH price feed for options pricing needs to use an oracle pulling ETH pricing from multiple exchanges; otherwise a bad actor could manipulate ETH price on one source exchange and impact the entire options market.

Closed source protocols - Ensure that protocols we utilize are open source so that contract code can be easily inspected.

All investments and strategies are to undergo a risk assessment whereby each of the above risks are investigated and taken into consideration. Any known risk is to be clearly articulated in any proposal to the Aave community.

Portfolio Construction Framework
The goal of the asset allocation is to maximize the portfolio return relative to a predetermined level of risk with consideration given to the following core functions:

Offset the risk profile of the existing Aave position by reinvesting generated capital into a diversified portfolio of less correlated and less volatile assets.
Maximize total return relative to volatility of the return. This is done through diversification and also deployment of capital into productive assets (e.g., aTokens).
Utilize derivatives where applicable to modify risk exposures to suit the needs of the Aave Treasury.
When deploying assets productively, each additional layer of smart contract risk will be examined in an attempt to minimize contagion within the portfolio of assets.

Individual investments will be assessed for their impact on the total portfolio’s risk/return characteristics, rather than on the individual investment’s specific characteristics in line with Modern Portfolio Theory. For example, a high-risk investment isn’t necessarily precluded from a conservative, low-risk portfolio as long as it is properly within the total portfolio’s risk budgeting constraints. Oftentimes, assets of varying risk when combined actually reduce overall risk.
Since it is likely Aave will be implementing a strategy of borrowing against the native AAVE token to build a productive and diversified portfolio, it is helpful to understand the correlation of assets relative to the AAVE token. Below is the correlation of return from the assets currently supported on Aave. These correlation values are determined based on daily returns in the past 3 months. We use all of the price history available since the launch of the shortest lived token i.e. KNC. Monthly returns may be used to suppress daily fluctuation-related noise and better isolate the signal of interest i.e. correlation of returns. However, we are limited by the small amount of price/return history currently available. Note that DAI is used as a proxy for all stable coin assets supported on Aave (DAI, GUSD, USDC, USDT, BUSD, SUSD, TUSD).

Figure - Correlation matrix to capture correlation of returns of all assets supported on Aave. Historical returns used in analysis are limited by the project with the shortest history.

Strategic Asset Allocation
The asset allocation will be determined by considering where individual assets fall into a risk spectrum as identified here:

Screenshot 2021-09-15 at 22.28.361248×718 66.7 KB

Using the framework above, we propose the following long-term strategic targets for the diversified portfolio separate from the concentrated AAVE position:

Low Risk (50%)

Per the correlation matrix above, the most immediate benefit to the Aave treasury is the introduction of a stablecoin allocation.
The stablecoin allocation can be productively deployed throughout DeFi to generate a yield.
If Aave elects to borrow against the AAVE token, it makes sense to primarily borrow stablecoins due to their lower risk profile. If these stablecoins are then deployed throughout DeFi, the Aave treasury would essentially be creating a collateralized debt position.


Medium Risk (30%)

The medium risk bucket is composed of assets that will typically be highly correlated to the AAVE token given the high correlations of assets in the crypto ecosystem.
The goal of the medium risk bucket is to gain exposure to large-cap, high-quality crypto assets while helping to diversify some of the specific idiosyncratic risks of the AAVE token.


High Risk (20%)

This bucket will mainly include allocations to strategic partnerships and investments, and therefore may be relatively illiquid.
The primary focus of this bucket will be to support the ecosystem.



We understand that building a diversified portfolio takes time, so instead these targets are provided as a framework for long-term allocations.

Rebalancing Guidelines
The TMC will periodically review the asset allocation of the portfolio to determine if any adjustments are necessary based on material changes to market conditions or Aave’s unique circumstances. Given the inherent volatility of crypto, the TMC will be active in rebalancing when necessary during periods of market stress to ensure constraints remain in effect (e.g. actively adjusting collateral to reduce risk of liquidation).",35,446.8,2021-09-15
['Aave - Asset Management Guidelines'],"Awesome writeup. Creating a robust treasury plan is definitely worth doing considering the immense amount of capital at stake. For the sake of that goal, I’d like to challenge a core premise of the guidelines you’ve proposed.



 MatthewGraham:

Since one of the goals of the Aave treasury is to maintain concentration in the native governance token, strategies will likely employ debt by borrowing stablecoins and other assets against AAVE. For this reason, it is necessary to identify specific metrics for managing risk when deploying leverage.


Is it actually in the best interest of AAVE as a protocol to maintain concentration in its own token? I would argue that it’s not, and can actually hold AAVE back. To see why, we should consider what the purpose of the AAVE token is in the first place. The token is distributed as incentives to stakeholders in the protocol for the purpose of governing the protocol. Leveraging and hoarding the AAVE token in the treasury doesn’t seem to fulfill this purpose at all.
The focus of AAVE should be to DISTRIBUTE these tokens in a way that benefits the protocol as much as possible. IMO, the treasury should be built up by other means, and the AAVE token should remain in the most liquid state possible for distribution. The fact that the AAVE token has immense financial value may prove to be a curse and a perverse incentive for the protocol to continue hoarding the tokens which would better be used to distribute governance power.
Ultimately, the reason why I think the treasury prioritizing the accumulation of AAVE tokens is not ideal is because this essentially means the treasury would compete with users for stakeholding power in the protocol and hurt the decentralization of the protocol. While this may be enriching to the protocol in the short term, I don’t think this is in the best interest of AAVE in the long term.
I hope I’m not bringing up any tired arguments here! Please let me know if I’m mistaken about anything. I don’t have any treasury management experience after all.",27,60.4,2021-09-16

Introduction
We enjoyed reading both this post and the Initial Treasury Strategy Llama has proposed. We largely agree with the approach to diversifying risk and thinking carefully about the treasury’s long term goals. However, we believe that given the rapidly-changing nature of the space, the treasury would be better served by more active management. We dive into this a bit more below, including a suggestion for implementation.
We have commented separately on the Initial Treasury Strategy where we outline some specific strategies we believe would be beneficial to the further diversification of the treasury.
Active vs Passive Management
In general we think it’s important to maintain flexibility given how fast yield opportunities can change in the space. The easiest way to do this by having a committee which implements a high level strategy (eg. try to get the best yields on stable coins) but then authorizes one party to implement  it. This prevents us from getting lazy in positions and not being flexible and nimble enough to react on emerging opportunities.
Obviously, we would want to prevent someone abusing this power so we’d propose using a protocol like Enzyme to carefully define policies which limit the behaviour of what a delegated trader can and can’t do (Enzyme’s protocol is currently shipped with many such policies, and writing custom smart contracts for this specific use case is possible).
There is already an example of a protocol using Enzyme for a similar purpose. Unslashed Finance, an insurance protocol, has deployed ~30,000 ETH (~$90m) into an Enzyme Vault where it is earning yield in the form of more ETH, CRV, and LDO from the Curve stETH pool. We worked hand in hand with Unslashed to ensure the protocol adapters required for their strategies were brought to Enzyme in a timely manner and lent a hand during the migration process.
Efficiency vs Transparency & Accountability
The TMC (Treasury Management Council, proposed here) could be a multi-sig which delegates, breaks up and allocates strategies via Enzyme vaults. The advantage of these is that each strategy can be managed by a 3rd party in a controlled way and with exact permissions being pre-determined by the TMC. In addition, the AAVE community benefits from professional real-time reporting, historic on-chain reporting, risk management controls and full transparency.
Insurance
As AAVE seeks to earn yield on its assets by using a wide range of DeFi protocols, we believe defining the risks that could emerge and insuring at least a part of portfolio will be important.
Who We Are
Our team is Avantgarde Finance. We have been building in the DeFi space for five years and share more than 40 years of cumulative experience in TradFi.  More recently, we have broadened our focus to providing Treasury Management Services. This can be anything from developing custom integrations and reporting tools required by DAOs to managing the assets on behalf of DAOs on-chain and implementing strategies.",16,68.2,2021-09-20
['Aave - Initial Treasury Strategy'],"Authors from Llama: @MatthewGraham, @Dydymoon and @AcceleratedCapital.

Introduction
Llama would like to present the Aave community an opportunity to deploy the Reserve Factor (RF) to earn additional yield by acquiring BAL rewards on Balancer V2. The balance of the RF and Ecosystem Reserve (ER) are shown below:




Wallet
USD
Notes




Ecosystem Reserve
$821M
100% AAVE


Reserve Factor V1
$0.42M
$224K aDAI, $176K aUSDC, $340K ETH


Reserve Factor V2
$13.88M
$7.44M aUSDC, $2.4M aUSDT, $2.3M aDAI, $0.15M awETH


Reserve Factor Polygon
$5.06M
$1.2M amUSDC, $1.2M amDAI, $0.6M amUSDT, $0.5M amWETH, $0.76M amWBTC



This strategy has two goals:

Earn additional yield with the aTokens from the treasury
Accumulate governance influence with protocols that interact with Aave

Llama proposes depositing a portion of the aTokens held in the RF into Balancer V2 pools to earn BAL rewards. The aTokens are wrapped, creating a waToken, and the yield generated from holding the aToken accumulates within the wrapper. Aave is still earning yield from the aToken as if it was held within the RF wallet, but will also accrue trading fees and BAL rewards by providing liquidity on Balancer V2.
An alternative strategy is to use AAVE from the ER as collateral in order to borrow stables to fund the yield generating strategy. The cost of capital is reduced by the borrowing incentives on V2, the fee income that flows to the RF, and the interest received by the aTokens. Provided the loan is sufficiently overcollateralized and managed, the risk to the Aave treasury is largely derived from Balancer V2 Smart Contract risk. This risk seems very low, at the time of writing Balancer V2 has more than $1.6b TVL (mainnet and polygon combined) and offers the largest, unclaimed bug bounty (1000 ETH) in the industry. The investment generates a positive ROI due to the low cost of capital, Balancer trading fees, and BAL incentivises.
Further to the above, there exists the potential for the Balancer V2 liquidity provider (LP) token to be integrated into Aave’s AMM platform. This creates a further use case and presents an opportunity for Aave to provide liquidity to the underlying pools.

Utilising Reserve Factor to Earn Yield
The general strategy is to deploy DAI, USDC, USDT equivalents held within the RF into Balancer V2 pools to earn yield from Aave V2, trading fees and BAL rewards. ETH and BTC equivalent assets are to be deposited into Balancer V2 to earn trading fee income and BAL rewards. The BAL rewards are to be accumulated over time and held as a strategic asset. Other governance tokes, like LDO are to be sold for ETH and reinvested into the ETH strategy.

Stable Coins (DAI, USDC, USDT)
Llama has been discussing with Balancer a yield strategy that involves depositing Aave’s aDAI, aUSD, and aUSDT holdings into the next iteration of the metastable pool on V2. The staBAL3 pool deposits around 90% of the stables back into Aave V2 making them productive whilst also receiving additional BAL incentives.
In addition to the yield from Aave accruing for liquidity providers, Balancer is expected to offer incentives. The staBAL3 metastable pool will boost productivity as the yield from the 10% of stables not deposited in Aave is more than offset by the entire stable balance earning BAL rewards plus trading fee income. The stables are now earning yield from Aave and BAL rewards, this is expected to roughly double the overall yield generated by these assets.
For example, the Balancer V2 DAI / USDC / USDT pool is $163M in size and generates 12.21% APR, comprising 0.03% in swap fees and 12.18% in BAL rewards. This pool still doesn’t lend its underlying stable coins to AAVE, which will be the case with the new version of the staBAL3 pool.
We expect the pool to be launched in the coming months, potentially early Q4, 2021. When the full details are released, we will be able to refine the strategy further and present an ARC to the community. At this point in time we are considering depositing around half of Aave V2’s DAI, USDC and USDT equivalent into the pool which is a bit over $6M. The final amount will be defined in the ARC and will depend on feedback received from this post.
The overview for deploying the stable coins is summarised below:

Deposit half of Aave V2 RF’s aDAI, aUSDC, and aUSDT holdings on Balancer V2 to earn BAL rewards
Expected APR is difficult to predict, but is anticipated to be greater than 10% in addition to the aToken yield
BAL rewards are to be held as a strategic asset and not sold

Acquiring the BAL tokens whilst only forgoing a fraction of the yield otherwise earned is a near-zero cost way of acquiring a Balancer holding. Given the relationship between Balancer and Aave, the BAL holding becomes a strategic asset that further aligns the two communities through ownership.

Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC)
For the ETH and BTC allocation, we’ve identified two potential strategies to generate additional yield.
The first strategy is to take advantage of the recently launched metastable pools from Balancer. The first pool Balancer has launched is wstETH / wETH. The stETH yield accumulates within the wstETH token. Currently, the pool is yielding 18.73% APR, comprising 0.46% swap fee, 3.07% stETH staking rewards, and 15.20% from liquidity mining (2.10% BAL and 13.1% LDO).
The alternative strategy is to deposit ETH into the Curve stETH / ETH pool and earn CRV and LDO rewards. The yield is currently around 6.7%, comprising 6.36% LDO and 0.27%-0.68% CRV.
When comparing these strategies, the rewards on Balancer are greater than Curve, with both Lido and Balancer offering relatively higher rewards than available on Curve. Due to this, Llama’s preference is to earn BAL rewards and concentrate on acquiring Balancer protocol governance influence.
ETH is typically deposited into Aave as collateral and the utilisation rate is less than 5% on V2, so the the yield generated from holding aETH is low relative to other productive use cases.

Aave currently holds the equivalent of 391 ETH across the RFs and have a current market value of $1.3M (0.11% of the total treasury; comprising 156 amwETH, 44 awETH and 101 ETH)
Deposit 90% of the ETH into the wstETH / wETH pool on Balancer V2
Retain 10% for gas costs
BAL rewards are to be acquired as a strategic asset and not sold

Similar to the ETH strategy, Balancer offers 7.15% APR on the stable pool wBTC / renBTC / sBTC of which 6.98% comes from BAL incentives. By comparison, Aave offers less than 1% on BTC assets.

Aave holds the equivalent of 18.18 aBTC across the RFs with a current market value of $850K (0.1% of the total treasury; comprising 16.25maBTC, 1.93 aBTC)
Deposit all of the BTC-equivalent holdings into the Balancer pool to earn BAL rewards
BAL rewards are to be acquired as a strategic asset and not sold


Conclusion
This forum post introduces the concept of deploying the Reserve Factor to earn additional yield through BAL rewards by providing liquidity on Balancer V2. There will be a Snapshot vote to gauge community sentiment towards this proposal. If the sentiment and feedback in the comments below is favourable, then this strategy will be developed further and presented to the community at a later date when the details around the pools are known.",60,2802.0,2021-09-15

Introduction
We enjoyed reading both this post and the Asset Management Guidelines Llama has proposed. We largely agree with the approach to diversifying risk and thinking carefully about the treasury’s long term goals. However, we believe that given the rapidly-changing nature of the space, the treasury would be better served by more active management. We’ll touch on that separately in the Asset Management Guidelines comments section.
Here, we’ll outline some specific strategies we believe would be beneficial to the diversification of the treasury, focusing mainly on the stable coins from the Reserve Factor, which we believe should be implemented first. We also touch on the large AAVE balance in the ecosystem fund.
Stable Coins (DAI, USDC, USDT)
As a reminder, the Reserve Factor represents funds collected as a share of the protocol’s interest and is used to pay protocol contributors. In other words, it will be distributed in regular and predictable amounts at a regular and predictable cadence, and grow linearly with the protocol’s utilization. Its balance has no impact on the safety of the protocol, and staking rewards are paid out of the Ecosystem Reserve (which is 50-75 times larger than the Reserve Factor). These factors combine to make it an appealing first step in decentralizing the Aave treasury’s asset management program.
We like the idea of allocating 50% of the reserves to the Balancer V2 DAI / USDC / USDT pool (later migrating to staBAL3 pool when it becomes available towards the end of the year). The returns promise to be attractive, and we agree that building a strategic stake in BAL is a worthwhile endeavor.
We would note, though, that even then - diversifying across strategies would be prudent. There’s another immediately-available opportunity to run a similar strategy in another protocol where building a strategic stake of tokens also makes sense.  Indeed, Curve offers a pool with a similar APR that could perhaps be boosted further over time by increasing AAVE’s CRV holdings. Whilst the Curve governance forum did not agree to a token swap in recent forum discussions there is no reason why we could not just DCA these in the market and leverage some influence over the gauge rewards as and when that becomes interesting.
With that in mind, we propose that in addition to the OP’s Balancer proposal**,** that we allocate the remaining 50% of the Reserve Factor’s stable coins to the Curve AAVE pool and running a yield farming strategy on that position. The yield on this pool may be additionally be enhanced through accumulating a position in CRV.
AAVE
Borrowing stable coins against the AAVE position and deploying them in to various yield-bearing strategies is a good first step. However, given the sheer size of the position, we do not believe it should be the only strategy the treasury employs. We have spent time researching the utilization of Uniswap v3’s liquidity pools to manage a highly concentrated position. By concentrating liquidity provision effectively on different parts of the price curve, in addition to earning LP fees, we can strategically lighten up on AAVE after big rallies whilst buying more on big sell offs. We are happy to present and model this further if of interest.
Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC)
We agree that leveraging Balancer for the ETH/BTC strategy makes sense given the superior yields it earns. It is also worth keeping an eye on the Curve tricrypto2 pool which is yielding 11% (base) to 25% (max boost) in rewards, especially if it is decided to purchase CRV as per above suggestion.

Paragraph Summary
Fei introduces a community-governed reserve backed stablecoin that aims to achieve digitally-driven, governance-minimized central banking. Fei has created a new stablecoin that seeks to stabilize itself, not via IOU-based debt commitments, rather through a monetary peg-based policy on the basis of protocol controlled reserves, currently valued at $643 million. Enabling $FEI for lending on Aave would allow the $595 million circulating FEI supply to be deposited into Aave, and would also allow Fei Protocol to use the protocol-controlled value (PCV) ($643 million dollars) to create highly-liquid lending markets. Current trading volume at the time of posting of $FEI is 7D trading volume on Uni V3 $172 million and Uni V2 $361 million. In addition to the new volume and TVL that $FEI would bring to the Aave ecosystem, $FEI would provide Aave with diversification benefits, including another decentralized stablecoin.
Motivation
Add $FEI as a lending currency into Aave money markets.

Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token

FEI is a decentralized and scalable stablecoin for DeFi.

Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?

If listed, FEI would be one of the most decentralized stablecoins on Aave. The Fei DAO can support FEI markets on Aave by providing FEI liquidity. Traders will have the ability to tap into the large FEI-ETH liquidity on Uni V2 ($561 million) Uniswap Info as well as any future protocol owned or incentivized liquidity pools.

Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?

Fei Protocol launched in April 2021 with a DAO since day one, and currently has over $643 million in liquidity. Fei aligns itself with the top communities and teams in the space, including Aave, with a similar decentralization ethos. There has been a large voter turnout during important community and team lead proposals that supported stabilizing the peg after the initial launch of the protocol.

How is the asset currently used?

FEI is currently being used in lending markets, including Fuse, and soon to be CREAM. FEI is growing and finding utilization in other financial service offerings in the broader DeFi ecosystem: lending, synthetics, option platforms, exchanges and AMM’s, etc.

Emission schedule

There is no emission schedule.

Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?

Contracts within the Fei protocol have the ability to mint and burn FEI through processes that support stabilization around the 1 USD price target. The DAO controlled by TRIBE holders has the ability to mint FEI and appoint other Minter and Burner contracts.
The FEI contract itself is not upgradeable.
An additional role, the Guardian, can pause the minting of FEI. The Fei Core Team holds this role in a multi-sig, with the intention of either renouncing the role or transitioning to a community held multi-sig. More information can be read in our docs: https://docs.fei.money/governance/fei-guardian

['ARC: Add support for $FEI as a deposit currency'],"FEI Risk Assessment
FEI is one of the few truly decentralized stablecoins, currently backed solely by ETH. Fei Protocol’s PCV holds $521MM of ETH, providing a 281% collateralization ratio for all circulating FEI. FEI’s total supply stands at 367MM with 182MM FEI controlled by the protocol and 185MM FEI in circulation, falling in the top 10 largest stablecoins by total supply.
While relatively new, the FEI protocol and community have made significant progress on the peg stabilization mechanisms. FEI remains one of the most liquid stablecoins, with $345MM in liquidity available on Uniswap v2. Current liquidity dynamics enable $1MM trades with <0.50bps slippage.
As Aave seeks to expand the numbers of assets supported in a safe manner, FEI has the potential to introduce new lending and borrowing activity to the protocol. As one of the largest decentralized stablecoins, FEI holders have been actively seeking yield opportunities. A FEI market on Aave establishes a robust credit market for FEI lenders and borrowers with the potential to bring new users to Aave.
Unique to FEI, the protocol manages a $521MM PCV. In the future, the FEI community can choose to allocate PCV resources toward Aave.
Smart Contract Risk - B
Fei completed its Genesis event on April 3, 2021, raising 639k ETH for the PCV. Fei has completed 2 audits with Open Zeppelin and Consensys Diligence. In the case of time sensitive issues, the Fei Guardian can pause the system - held by the Fei Core Team in a multisig with the intention of either renouncing the role or transitioning to a community held multi-sig, but has no mint/issue abilities. The Fei Guardian is currently controlled by the Fei team with plans to transition to a community multisig in the coming months. The Guardian can revoke any role from any contract, pause/unpause contracts, and force a reweight.
Counterparty Risk - C
FEI holders can sell FEI for ETH on DEXs or choose to redeem from the protocol at $0.95. FEI ownership remains highly concentrated on Uniswap, with 46.9% held in the Uniswap FEI-ETH pool and 44.8% held in the Uniswap FEI-TRIBE pool. 3,856 unique addresses hold FEI.
Market Risk - B+
FEI has become a top 10 stablecoin with a total supply of 367MM. With $345MM in liquidity, FEI can support multi-million dollar swaps with minimal slippage. Given the PCV, FEI maintains a stable base of liquidity for FEI holders in all market conditions, unlike other stablecoins dependent on individual LPs. This enables liquidators to have plenty of access to FEI liquidity when needed.
While FEI struggled to maintain its peg post-Genesis, the protocol made key changes to stabilize the peg, reducing volatility.
Also, Chainlink launched FEI-ETH and TRIBE-ETH price feeds.

Borrowing Enabled: true
Stable BorrowRate Enabled: false
Reserve Decimals: 18

Rationale
By starting FEI at a 0% collateral factor, the stablecoin can only be supplied or borrowed - not used as collateral. This limits the risk for Aave lenders, given users cannot borrow against their FEI. Over time, the community can explore raising the collateral factor.
We welcome feedback on these parameters.

Summary
TerraUSD (UST) is an algorithmic, seigniorage-based stablecoin issued by Terraform Labs (TFL). Its market capitalization has grown to $1.8B (​https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/terra-usd​) since its inception on October 1. UST is designed such that each UST can be redeemed for $1 of LUNA, and vice versa. This has kept the price close to the peg, which is essential for a stablecoin.
Motivation
The Terra community is quite active, and growing very quickly. Because our strategy is multi-chain, we are looking for  borrowing/lending markets for UST on all the chains where UST is supported. Ethereum is naturally the top destination for assets coming from the Terra chain.
The asset is supported by major dApps including Curve, Uniswap, Sushi onsen, Harvest, etc. UST can also be deposited into Mirror Protocol mAsset pools on Uniswap, and is depositable into Anchor via EthAnchor (EthAnchor - Anchor Protocol). We believe there will be sufficient demand for borrowing/lending given the variety of existing use cases.

Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token

Terra is the team behind Anchor Protocol and Mirror Protocol. UST has been live since October 2020, and has held peg well. There are 6,270 unique holders of erc20-UST.

Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?

As a stablecoin, it’s maintained its peg, particularly over periods of market volatility. And as mentioned above, we believe there will be sufficient borrowing/lending demand for UST given there are a variety of existing use cases.

Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are the live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?

Terra is the team behind Anchor Protocol and Mirror Protocol. Mirror has $2B TVL, and does ~$100M in daily volume. Anchor launched 5 weeks ago and has ~$700M TVL. Our oldest stablecoin is KRT, which was launched in 2018, and has been able to maintain peg for the last 3 years.

How is the asset currently used?

UST can be used on most of the major dApps - including Curve, Uniswap, Harvest, Sushi, etc. as well as on Terra applications such as on Mirror mAsset pools and ethAnchor.

Emission schedule

There is no emission schedule. Whenever there is fluctuation in demand for UST that causes the price to go off peg, $1 LUNA can be swapped for 1 UST, and vice versa.

Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability

As Stani pointed out in my last post, the minting function for UST is currently EOA. As I’ve mentioned to the team, we’ve been intending to migrate to a more decentralized proof of authority bridge created by the Wormhole team (https://solana.com/wormhole). But given the dependency on a 3rd party, it’s hard to put an exact estimate on go-live.
Given the history and robustness of our stablecoins over the last 3 years, we believe that the centralized properties of UST would pose low risk to the Aave ecosystem.

['AAVE: Cross Chain Deployment Success / Priorities'],"Hi
There are currently 2 governance proposals to expand AAVE cross chain - one to Harmony with a  snapshot that ends in roughly 2 days, and one from Avalanche that does not yet have a snapshot vote available.
The Harmony vote will clearly pass snapshot, and it appears from the supporting text that the Harmony team already has the code ready to deploy plus 5M in incentives to support liquidity.
Similarly, announcements have been made from the Avalanche team and AAVE teams that several million in incentives are ready to deploy to Avalanche seemingly immediately upon the eventual snapshot vote passing.
This sets up an interesting, and AFAIK novel, situation where AAVE could see near simultaneous deployment to 2 new chains at once! Amazing!
These ae strong moves for the AAVE ecosystem. It is un-controversially good for additional high-quality EVM blockspace to be filled by AAVE based transactions and AAVE base liquidity that generates value for the protocol.
These 2 chains both provide access to that type of block space and also to thousands of new potential users.  Done well this will be a strategically key moment for AAVE’s growth.
At the same time, these expansions also come with operational complexities.
For example, maintaining priority and clarity in marketing / communication about which incentives, apply to which chain, for how long.
Prioritizing order for changes to the AAVE front-end etc and prioritizing order for supporting trouble shooting on each deployment while also continuing to support both ETH and Matic.  This of course will come with an influx of newbie question from both communities as many users try AAVE for the first time.
And more!
TL;DR launching on 2 chains is exciting and also not operationally trivial.
I’m interested in understanding what policies and procedures are being contemplated to ensure these 2 new deployments execute well and the entire AAVE ecosystem benefits.
How is the decision to prioritize support for one chain deployment in front of another to be equitably handled in the inevitable situation that there are simultaneous issues on 2 or 3 chains?
Further, are there things members of the AAVE community might be called on to help with?  Are there gaps that must be filled?
There are more considerations I’m sure, but the above should be adequate to frame the challenge ahead and launch discussion.
I’m very curious where things stand, what current needs are if any, how to help if help is needed, and to confirm the adequate groundwork is in place not just in the code that deploys but also in change management to ensure the exceptional UX reputation that AAVE has earned over these past months grows even stronger during this exciting and aspirational next growth phase.

['AAVE: Cross Chain Deployment Success / Priorities'],"You definitely bring up a very relevant topic. Updates to the Polygon market imo have been excruciatingly slow, and so AAVE is likely not meeting the needs of the new chains as effectively as it could be.
Beyond just having more people to work on the protocol which I imagine is in the works, I’ve observed that much of the problem is simply the painful process of proposing AIPs. For example, the Aavegotchi team has been waiting to formally propose listing GHST for a long time now, and they were hoping to include amGHST as a collateral asset as part of a key attribute of the game.
I think it may be worth thinking about how we can expedite the process of listing assets in a timely manner in a way that doesn’t compromise the solvency of the protocol. I imagine that the formation of the Risk DAO could help with this, as they could be delegated proposal power to list assets instead of the current meta where projects that want to propose listing assets need to practically beg everyone to delegate them the proposal power necessary to get a proposal up.",27,85.2,2021-09-16

AIP-36: LTV and Liquidation Threshold Updates to Moderate Levels


Passed with 509k votes Yae and 0.09 votes Nay


In the month since executing Gauntlet’s Dynamic Risk Parameter AIP, we have learned a lot about the preferences of the Aave community. This includes how market risk is perceived, incentive alignment for companies like ourselves, and the vision of the protocol’s future. With that new information, we have updated our priors on how we can best serve DAO.
With new assets like FRAX, potentially FEI, and others being added to V2, Gauntlet would like to propose supporting borrow caps when the protocol is upgraded. The Aave community has shown it is keen to expand the set of assets supported, and borrow caps have proven to be a key lever for Gauntlet in managing risk without adding friction to the user experience.
Gauntlet has also been researching further the Economic Optimization Function we formulated in our Aave Market Risk Assessment (see Appendix C.6). To sustain the DAO and expand Gauntlet’s impact on protocol growth, we would also like to propose supporting asset reserve factors. Our target timeline is November to publish an ARC for the community.

['ARC: LTV and Liquidation Threshold Levels 2021-08-26'],"
Simple Summary
Three distinct levels from which the community can select a preferred risk tolerance for Aave V2.

Abstract
From a market risk perspective, the goal for Gauntlet’s simulations is to standardize Value-at-Risk (VaR) across all assets. Matching risk tolerance to a normalized expected yield throughout Aave V2 ensures no subset of assets adds disproportionate risk to the Safety Module.
Following asset onboarding, empirical data on user behaviour (e.g., average health factors) and changes in market conditions (e.g., expected slippage) improve our simulation precision. Improved precision allows for higher confidence in model outputs—particulary for aggressive recommendations.
Gauging risk appetite is something Gauntlet will do quarterly to ensure our risk parameter recommendations track the preference of the Aave community.

Motivation
The existing risk framework has been instrumental in facilitating onboarding new assets. As expected and observed, liquidity risk, volatility risk, and market capitalization frequently change for all assets on Aave. Updating LTV and Liquidation thresholds to remain in lockstep with the market is key to improving the target metrics outlined in Gauntlet’s Dynamic Risk Parameters proposal.

WBTC: Downside slippage values for WBTC have become smaller. This means liquidators see less slippage on trades and more liquidity. Additionally, a tight liquidation buffer will suffice given the lower market volatility.

YFI: Both slippage values and volatility have improved for YFI. The liquidation buffer shrinks between conservative and aggressive parameters due to marginal increase of liquidations observed during simulation. Doing so provides users an option to be more aggressive with starting positions should they choose.

LINK: Given market liquidity and LINK supplier’s borrow positions, the aggressive setting will only include an increase in liquidation threshold.

xSUSHI: Recent liquidation analysis on empirical data, lacking previously, provides higher confidence that insolvency events can be mitigated.

SNX: The major concern with for SNX is that there is very high volatility and high slippage. The aggressive setting requires a larger delta between LTV and liquidation threshold to compensate for the additional risk.

 pakim249:


How are the volatility indexes calculated?



The volatility is calculated by using the Garman-Klass volatility estimator. The detailed methodology is described in this paper.



 pakim249:


How do we interpret the slippage intensity sell and slippage power sell parameters?



The following equation is used to model slippage: intensity * volatility * (trade size / average daily trading volume) ^ power. We use the historical order book data to fit the intensity and power coefficients. The price slippage is proportional to the intensity coefficient and the power of the quantity traded.



 pakim249:


Do the simulations take into account the new gas price dynamics from EIP-1559?



The simulation doesn’t take the EIP-1559 gas price dynamics into account. Please see section C.4 in our Aave Market Risk Assessment for the details of network congestion modeling.",29,25.8,2021-08-27

Conservative metrics: the models target a 15% decrease on each side of the capital efficiency (opportunity cost of capital) as well as risk metrics (some conflation of liquidations, insolvencies, and market impact) on each asset.
Moderate metrics: target a similar risk profile to the current risk parameters with reweightings to achieve slightly better capital efficiency.
Aggressive recommendations target a 10% increase for capital efficiency (opportunity cost of capital) with considerations for the same risk metrics (liquidations, insolvencies, and market impact) on each asset.
Our models suggest there is headroom to make further updates across most Aave v2 assets. These initial changes look more at specific asset values that are suboptimal and baseline the risk appetite of the community. The Risk Dashboard currently in production will be able to provide much of that granularity in the near future.",28,50.6,2021-08-31

Paragraph Summary
Our goal is to support Aave as it continues to expand in the coming multi-chain world. Harmony is an open and fast blockchain that is fully Ethereum compatible with 2-second transaction finality and near-zero fees.
Harmony invites the Aave community to support this launch by initially participating in the Aave contracts deployment via multisig, enabling the Aave v2 front-end for Harmony markets, and adding Harmony in its recently announced cross-chain governance module roadmap.
Harmony will start with $2 million in incentives to bootstrap initial usage of Aave on Harmony.
Motivation
Aave is already planning to go multi-chain and we want to help bring it to the Harmony ecosystem, which is growing with the launch of Sushi on Harmony and other DeFi projects. Aave will be the first major lending protocol on Harmony and will add net new users from Harmony’s 350,000+ community members. After enabling basic DeFi primitives like AMMs, our community is eagerly awaiting lending markets on Harmony.
Specifications
What is the link between the author of the proposal and Harmony?
Harmony is a decentralized protocol operated by over 100 external validators. The author of this proposal is part of Harmony’s core team. The main contacts on Harmony for this proposal will be @li-jiang.
Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token
Harmony is a sharded proof-of-stake blockchain. It has processed more than 63M transactions on mainnet and it is fully EVM and Ethereum tooling compatible. Our secure bridges offer cross-chain asset transfers with Ethereum, Binance and 3 other chains.

Months 1-3: 40%
Months 4-6: 30%
Months 7-9: 20%
Months 10-12: 10%
Technical Specifications
Harmony will deploy a fork of Aave v2 GitHub - harmony-one/protocol-v2: Aave Protocol V2. We welcome feedback and support of the Aave core devs in deployment. Harmony supports multisig, subgraphs, chainlink to enable a fully functional Aave v2 market.
After the market is functional, we will work with the Aave core devs for cross-chain governance implementation on Aave v2 markets on Harmony.",187,28997.4,2021-07-29
['ARC: Aave Market Launch on Harmony'],Sounds like a great proposal. Harmony is a great platform to launch aave v2 - low cost with stable.,143,653.6,2021-07-29
['ARC: Aave Market Launch on Harmony'],"Deffinently a great proposal. And from a harmony Blockchain dev’s perspective who launched a dex a couple months ago, it’s deffinently an easy thing to do. All ethereum tooling are already available so no need to change much. Only thing to keep in mind is blocks are mined every 2 seconds. So there needs to be adjustments made when calculating issuance/block.
Other than that, easy money guys, go for it !
Can’t wait to see aave up and running on harmony.

Launching on harmony is very simple it being EVM compactable.
2-sec finality and super low gas fees make it one of the goto for many retail participants are unable to enter the space due to gas fees. Polygon provides this too, but it’s an L2, Harmony can provide the same thing at L1.

We wanted to walk you through our development plans for the Aave Risk Management Dashboard by Gauntlet as outlined in our ARC. Just to reiterate, our goals with this dashboard are twofold:

Help the community understand our recommendations and methodology
Help the community understand how our recommendations affect key risk metrics like VaR and Borrow Usage

Some additional points around the dashboard

It will be updated daily, and any parameter recommendations will be pushed both to our dashboard as well as kicked off in forum discussion similar to how we have done our recent liquidation bonus update. We’ll try to streamline this process over time to get parameter updates to market faster.
The version we have in our mocks has been validated in user studies and serves as our initial MVP. We hope to launch this quickly and then iterate on key components with the community.

We have kicked off development of the dashboard as of last week and are expecting to have it launched and live by Sept 22nd. We have 6 people on our team working on this dashboard and the various data components that power it: @jeremy, @marcinja, @eruleman , @wfu, @shaan, @inkyamze.
In particular we have the following milestones that we are targeting (some of which will be done in parallel)

Build out FE components with Mock data - @jeremy

Good pick up thus far having already achieved 33%+ but are there any concerns re: stagnation in the migration process 1) in general and 2) given that some are complaining about low yield for now for AAVE / better yield elsewhere with LEND?
According to a comment from @defidude on discord there is no deadline at the moment and one could only be implemented based on a governance vote. Is this something we want to pursue to eliminate doubt as to the path forward, LENDs place in it (or lack thereof) and to expedite progress?",108,1701.6,2020-11-05

['Migration Deadline'],I like the idea of moving over at your own pace. Someone in the Telegram channel said there is no due date currently on the migration. My inquiry was to determine if there was an urgent need to get out of a UniSwap position and I was told to get out when I consider it. He said “I expect along the time liquidity to be the moving and proceed to the migration through”. To me that sounds like at some point liquidity will be the driving force to migrate.,104,45.8,2020-10-07
['Migration Deadline'],I believe it would be beneficial to have just one token (Aave) as opposed to both Aave and legacy LEND. @marczeller just uploaded a community sentiment poll to bring Aave staking online and to allow native swap between stkAave and aLEND. I believe we should set a deadline reasonably after that functionality is enabled.,99,69.8,2020-10-06

Currently over 33% have migrated and I believe that the number will grow above 60% by next week when the centralized exchanges are migrating as well. Eventually all utility is in AAVE so it’s up to the governance to decide when to set a deadline for migration, probably something that could be reviewed within upcoming weeks again.",92,158.4,2020-10-06
['Migration Deadline'],"Hey all, really good point !
I also believe we should set up a reasonable deadline to migrate lend to aave, which could bring a lot of scarcity for the AAVE token, but i also agree that we need to list aave first, then maybe end of year could be good as a deadline, what do you think ?",80,111.0,2020-10-06
['Migration Deadline'],Deadline should be in place subject to 70%-75% migration completion for fairness to entire community.,76,40.2,2020-10-07
['Migration Deadline'],"It is quite tempting to have a deadline so that we can block future converted Aave from the stand point of a current Aave holder (myself included). But really if we get into a shoe of a long-time LEND holder who might have not been watching defi for months, it will be heartbreaking when they some day suddenly find out that LEND cannot function no more and there is no way to migrate to Aave just due to the deadline.It is simply unfair.
I am not technical savy if I think the only downside of keeping this migration contract going forever would be some sort of smart contract deployment fee? Based on the Math then we can probably cut off the deadline say at 99.99%?
I personally don’t think it is awfully fair to keep someone out.",76,85.2,2020-10-07
['Migration Deadline'],"If you ask me at the moment there is no need for a time line. After Binance swaps, there will be over 60-70% migrated for sure.

['Migration Deadline'],"Agree to keep it open for now and reassess at a later time.
1st, convert aLEND to aAAVE - collateral. If you create a deadline too soon, it could impact the overall in circulation value of AAVE, no? Plus leaving those invested in LEND no option to convert could have impacts on the eco all together.
No necessarily against the time deadline, but should be at a point where it makes sense to do so. I don’t think now, or even soon is the time.",70,39.0,2020-10-07
['Migration Deadline'],"hello everyone,
i think setting a deadline for the end of the migration is a good idea.
This will allow, as some have said, to have only one token left on the protocol and will also allow the real supply to be adjusted.
I think a lot of lend has been lost since its inception and therefore the aave supply will be distorted.
As to how to fix this i think we can look at two things.
First, choose a fairly distant (for example mid-2021 or end of 2021) in order to remain respectful of those who have invested one day and who do not necessarily look on the side of the current migration.  Second, we can also look at the swap velocity between lend and aave.
There will come a time when almost no token will be swapped.  At that moment it will be time to fix the date with more precision.
Let’s maintain impeccable ethics, but remember that this is not the most important question we are required to answer in the first place.",70,54.0,2020-10-07
['Migration Deadline'],"Hi all,
This is a very important point raised here and thanks for posting it.
I am torn between a deadline and a migration ratio (75/80%).
A deadline too far away would be penalizing in the short - medium term in my opinion
With an appropriate communication, this should reassure everyone.
Looking forward to reading you !",73,19.6,2020-10-07
['Migration Deadline'],"I’m also in-between on this one, but leaning towards supporting a deadline in the future.
The benefits of a deadline is less supply, in addition to that, a more active supply. You can safely assume all AAVE in circulation is fresh/active and likely not in dead accounts or forgotten about. On top of that, it brings us closer to leaving LEND behind and moving forward with AAVE.
The downside I think, is what everyone else is probably thinking, what about people who may not have known about the migration until it is too late. What effect could this have on the protocol? To me, it just seems like users could be upset or lose money because they weren’t aware of the migration or deadline in time, which is the main/only downfall I can see.
I think one approach I’d lean towards is after the migration has reached a certain point (60-70% migrated as others have suggested), we could set a deadline after that migration amount is met. But even doing that, I think there should be proper steps taken to ensure every LEND holder that can be possibly notified is notified, for example, MetaMask warned users about having SAI when it turned to DAI if I remember correctly, similar with Uniswap - so what if we could reach out to these providers to warn users still holding LEND that they’re able to migrate?
Just thinking out loud here.",69,48.8,2020-10-08
['Migration Deadline'],"Great comments everyone.
My question around a migration isn’t intended to lock anyone out of the ecosystem but rather to expedite the migration process and the benefits that AAVE brings.
Considering the uptick in activity on LEND wallets lately it would seem the community is reasonably aware of what’s going on. Between Twitter and Discord there seems to be a reasonable amount of communication channels to alert people. As @defidude suggested there is certainly benefit in reaching out to Metamask / etc to get the word out as well. Perhaps even engaging some of the more popular DeFi newsletter publications like Bankless and The Defiant?
Regardless of migration progress, setting a deadline for end of 2020 (3 months away) seems like a more than sufficient timeline for people to become aware and have the space needed to act.
My concern is the ecosystem feels like its in limbo at the moment with some on LEND and some on AAVE which is probably contrary to the hopes of the Aave team and contrary to whats best for the protocol. As long as there are other yield opportunities with LEND, it seems to me that its just going to be a very slow process for people to move over. Unclear what the “critical mass” number is regarding migration percentage for LEND positions to no longer be viable nor how long it will take to get there.",62,37.4,2020-10-09
['Migration Deadline'],I would be in favour of a migration deadline also. The sooner we are all in on aave the better. Obviously sufficient time should be allowed for migration and not to lock any holders out from migrating to Aave.,53,30.6,2020-10-09
['Migration Deadline'],"I believe a EOY deadline is an appropriate amount of time to allow LEND holders sufficient time to sort through their financial affairs. The best thing to do in my opinion is to at least begin with an initial deadline. If there is any concern with a specific date, then the community can at least get together to work through any concerns and set a more realistic date.",56,26.2,2020-10-09
['Migration Deadline'],Great topic and nice to see lots of comments. Agree with the deadline approach but don’t think it needs to be any time soon. Setting it 1 year from now (for example) would still be reasonable. So many variables to consider though and lots already mentioned. One I’d add is what if current aLend holders don’t migrate when the functionality is added? I guess we’d have to pass a proposal to auto migrate all aLend to aAave so we don’t liquidate holders?,56,11.2,2020-10-11
['Migration Deadline'],"Hi all,
Since the migration is happening at a breakneck pace since we have almost 70% of the total supply that has already been swapped.
I agree with the majority of the aavengers and propose that we set the migration deadline by the end of the year.
This allows time for the last 30% to swap and also limits the time that Aave will have two tokens in circulation.

Footprint is a powerful yet easy-to-use analytics tool to uncover and visualize blockchain data
The team consists of an experienced team of DeFi enthusiasts with diverse backgrounds, including smart contract developers, consumer internet product designers, investment managers from the banking industry, and risk modeling practitioners
Footprint is committed to transforming data and information into actionable insights, to find value in every movement
Proposal

This proposal advocates for providing a real-time dashboard on Aave
This proposal advocates for recommending Aave users trying to create dashboards and queries, to develop analytical thinking, and discuss the platform development scientifically

At first, Footprint will provide a real-time dashboard for Aave users. Not in a normal way relying on API only, using Bitquery and Airflow, Footprint built three commonly used modules, through conducting protocol-decoding and figuring out input and output of each pool, and analyze events behind pools. Footprint can provide automated, intelligent data integrity & data quality verification mechanisms. The system can automatically check the data before data entry, timely warning, and automatic repair
Then, Footprint will be a tool that existing Aave users can use. Aave users build out their own dashboards and intensify interest and loyalty towards DeFi and Aave
Reason
Users can understand and analyze the real-time data of Aave and build confidence in the Aave ecosystem
Footprint can help members of the Aave community to promote their analytical thinking and properly distribute their assets
Analyze Pool reports to obtain deeper insight data, optimize DAO’s investment management strategy, and maximize the return of the platform’s investment strategy
Result
Footprint provides customized dashboards to promote the development of the Aave ecosystem and serve users
Everyone can be a project analyst and contribute insights to Aave and DeFi industry

Paragraph Summary
Description of the proposal in a paragraph <200 words
We’d like to make a proposal for Aave to support our token GLM as a collateral asset. We think being able to trade GLM on Aave would open new paths for decentralization and would be beneficial for both Aave and Golem.
Motivation
Golem Network is a marketplace for idle computing power. It enables providers and requestors of computing power to connect in a trustless peer-to-peer network enabling both application owners and individual users (“requestors”) to rent resources from other users’ (“providers”) machines.
These resources can be used to complete tasks requiring any amount of computation time and capacity. Nowadays, centralized cloud providers are in control of these services, these platforms are constrained by closed networks, proprietary payment systems, and hard-coded provisioning operations. Golem proposes an open-source, decentralized and user controlled alternative.
Specifications

What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?

María Paula Fernández is advisor to the BoD of Golem Factory Gmbh.

Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token

Golem Network is a marketplace for idle computing power. It enables providers and requestors of computing power to connect in a trustless peer-to-peer network enabling both application owners and individual users (“requestors”) to rent resources from other users’ (“providers”) machines.
GLM is the utility token, to be used to access the Golem Network, and is the currency used in peer-to-peer transactions for renting idle digital resources including spare computing power.

Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?

Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are the live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?

2014 – First presentation in DEVCON0
2015 – Golem Network’s CEO presents Nanopayments in Ethereum in DEVCON1
2016 – Originally to be funded by DAOis

November – Golem Network becomes one of the first projects to crowdfund for building

2018 – Becomes one of the first apps to be launched into Ethereum mainnet
2020 – Presentation and launch of the new Golem platform

Begins token migration to the ERC20 standard
Becomes one of the first dApps to implement Layer 2 payments

2021 – Golem mainnet launches for the second time
In 2019 we decided to improve the former iteration of Golem, and since from the original vision (2014 - whitepaper in 2016) to date, many things had changed, including technological advancements that benefited the project. Therefore, after working on a new, modular and cutting edge architecture, we set to building it: an entirely new architecture + codebase. In 2020 we published the first releases and in 2021 launched to mainnet the current implementation.

How is the asset currently used?

Golem went mainnet (for the second time!) and GLM is used to exchange resources on Golem.

Emission schedule

We held a crowdfunding in on November 11, 2016 and ended in 29 minutes. Total created 1.000.000.000 GNT. GNT they were migrated to GLM an ERC20 token, migration started on November 19, 2020

Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?

['An Aave-Paladin Voting Market'],"Hey everyone, Figue from Paladin
We’re excited to share what we’ve been working on and how it can contribute to your governance. At its heart the Paladin protocol aims to enhance governance interactions with voting markets, coordination mechanisms and more.
While the topic of vote lending and liquid influence is controversial, we believe that built correctly and in tandem with the community, the right guardrails can be defined to ensure healthier governance. In this discussion we want to elaborate on why we took the approach we did, how it can help persistent shortcomings in governance and how you can contribute to it all.
Let’s be clear, vote borrowing is nothing new, today’s lending protocols already enable it. Anyone with enough capital can collateralize assets and borrow governance tokens. But this only enables whales and is very rough around the edges.
Paladin Lending aims to fill the gap by providing a dedicated lending protocol to manage influence in governance. We want to create a win-win solution between investors and activists for more effective coordination : creating utility for passive non-voters and granting new tools for activists.
If you’re interested in learning more about the Paladin vision and architecture check out our articles: Manifesto for a new wave of corporate activism, Paladin, the governance lending platform, Voting Markets: Why now.
TLDR : Why a voting market :
DAOs are rooted in a vision of openness and low barriers so all kinds of individuals can work together in full transparency. This protocol has thousands of different tokenholders yet when you look at the voting record it’s heavily skewed toward a few participants. This is for a lot of reasons: protocols are st:ill distributing ownership, high gas fees, information overload, passive investors, etc. A class of delegates is emerging but it’s still questionable how effective this will be. Overall the result is a lot of idle governance power and centralization risk.
Our bet is that voting markets can make this influence liquid and separate passive investors from players who are really interested in participating.
Evolving together :
During our stealth development we’ve connected with a lot of delegates, active voters and core teams to tailor the protocol to their needs. Feedback is a crucial part of our process and we’ll continue to work closely with communities integrated into Paladin. That way lending markets can better reflect each culture.
In its current design, staking pools can be customized in terms of access (whitelisting delegates, need for minimum “skin in the game”…) or through its interest model.
NB : the current pricing models are a bonding curve with Utilization Rate of the pool and Quorum / Proposal threshold as parameters. In the current design, the loan cost discourages huge borrows for long periods and reduces potential GEV on large loans.
Paladin will be live on main net by end of September and we wanted to use this post as a greeting and an invitation to collaborate. By creating a community designed pool, the Aave community can enable liquid governance on its terms.
There will be an upcoming community call the 13th of September at 18:00 CET in our Discord, to clarify everything that needs more explanation. If you can join us we’d love to hear from you. If not, feel free to share your thoughts in this discussion and we’ll answer any questions.",24,304.8,2021-09-02

['Eczodex - a stablecoin offering intrinsic capital growth'],"Description
Today millions of people invest in financial markets without a rational approach to their investment decisions. Irrational market behaviour triggers boom and bust cycles that can have damaging economic consequences to households and businesses. Furthermore, in the era of social media the risk of financial market gamification has increased; assets can be pumped and dumped from just a single tweet or message board posting.
Eczodex believes self-pricing financial instruments are a solution to irrational market behaviour. Our entry offering targets the cryptocurrency markets with a stablecoin statistically proven to combine intrinsic capital growth with low volatility.
A back test against our prototype pricing algorithm, spanning 20 years, revealed that over 99% of daily price swings fell within the range of 0-1% and generated an average annual yield of 6.6%.
Problem
Our project is looking to address the following problems:


Bipolar investment selection - Investors can choose to invest either in volatile
coins that bear the risk of exiting at loss; or stablecoins not yielding any intrinsic interest.


Asset pricing driven by noise - Social media has increased the risk of financial market gamification; assets can be pumped and dumped from just a single tweet or message board posting.


CBDCs threaten stablecoins - Central bank plans to launch stablecoins creates an
existential threat to fiat-pegging stablecoins.


Goals
Building on the initial success of dynamic pegged coins such as RAI and Float, Eczodex aims to further innovate in this space, providing price stability with a free floating asset.
Our prototype coin, modelled on US fundamental data, draws on the quarterly balance sheets of public listed companies to set its pricing peg. The result is a coin with 2000 price updates per year, is free floating against the dollar, and does not require a fixed peg to maintain stability. Instead, price stability is achieved simply by virtue of the weighted average book values of the companies that make up the composition, which is regularly updated to reflect the top performing 500 companies by public market cap. Our back test generated a 6.6% annual yield.
Use cases:


Stablecoins are well represented on the AAVE platform; therefore, Eczodex is well positioned to contribute to expanding the AAVE ecosystem.


It is an ideal investment asset for DeFi Insurance protocols that have to invest $500mn + in stable, risk-averse products


It is an attractive investment asset to onboard institutional investors


It provides an alternative to negative or low yielding bank accounts, encouraging further adoption of DeFi products and services.


Milestones
To date we have developed the protocol design and prototype pricing algorithm.
We have initially received very promising and positive feedback within the Cambridge University ecosystem, encouraging us to design and develop an initial prototype on Ethereum’s testnet. Now we want to take the next step and further validate our proposition within the DeFi community.
We are targeting the following milestones:

Develop our market making smart contract which will integrate with Uniswap v3 (2months)
Develop the pricing algorithm (3 months)
Develop the treasury management smart contract (4 months)
Release a fully functioning prototype to Ethereum testnet (4 months)
Obtain legal counsel covering all legal & regulatory aspects of the launch (4 months)
Community building and prototype feedback (4 - 6 months)
Stablecoin launch (7 months)

Could you please elaborate on your positioning within the Aave Ecosystem and how Aave could benefit from Exzodex? There are already many stablecoins out there, only the less risky ones/most proven currenlty on Aave
For Aave Grants, you also need to get in touch via the Aave Grants DAO Notion",8,6.6,2021-09-02
['Eczodex - a stablecoin offering intrinsic capital growth'],"Thanks for the response. Answers below:
Positioning within the Aave Ecosystem
Floating peg stablecoins untied to FIAT currencies are an asset class in their own right. They provide investors with another option to run a diversified portfolio and hold distinct advantages to the inevitable introduction of CBDCs. Our bet is that they represent the future direction of stablecoin innovation.
Currently floating peg stablecoins are not offered on the Aave protocol,  however with recent launches in this category such as RAI and FLOAT, we believe that it’s only a matter of time
before they become a staple asset class on the biggest DeFi money market platforms.
Collaboration with Eczodex
Eczodex is at the beginning of its journey to develop a market leading floating peg stablecoin. Currently a team of 3 from Cambridge University, we have good access to talent and contact with the Centre for Alternative Finance which is progressing research into crypto and the wider DeFi space at Cambridge Judge Business School. The opportunity to work closely with who we believe our potential customers are, is the reason behind this grant application. By collaborating with us on protocol design, Aave gets to make a first hand assessment of the value proposition, the team behind it, and at the most granular level the smart contract code.
We fully understand that any protocol must be proven to work and our initial view is that it will require at least a year post launch as evidence of its credentials. Nevertheless we see early collaboration as ultimately a win-win outcome, that will grow both the Aave ecosystem and usage of Eczodex stablecoin.
We look forward to hearing from you and are willing to jump on a call at a time of your convenience.

This difference is especially noticeable in the AMPL market, where the configured interest rate can go up to 10,002% at max utilization.
The AAVE Genesis team has been made aware and they will publish more guidance on the discrepancy.

ARC Rationale
As mentioned in AIP-26, a nonlinear interest curve is more suited for AMPL’s market and potentially other assets on AAVE’s platform. It turns out that this over-approximation produces just such a curve.
The over-approximation mentioned above results in an exponentially growing curve which allows for defining a more suitable interest curve for AMPL. We propose the following parameters for AAVE’s default interest rate strategy, which produce the curve below:

Optimal utilization = 80%
Base rate = 1%
Slope1 = 2%
Slope2 = 750%

The part of the curve under 80% Utilization:

Rationale:

Accounting for the over-approximation of the existing Slope2=10,000% interest curve requires reducing the slope2 parameter.
Taking advantage of the exponential curve allows for:
a. Setting a higher optimal utilization rate.
b. Setting a higher maximum APY.
without creating a too steep of an interest rate increase right above the optimal utilization rate.

Historical statistics on rebasing data place a 5% rebase as the 95% percentile of the distribution. It seems the interest rate model max rate should cover this scenario as it’s not sustainable to call upon governance for frequent parameters adjustments. 5% daily yield takes us to 1825% APR which takes us to ​5,421,184,057% APY with daily compounding.

 Alex_BertoG:

Based on this the current 10,000% slope 2 seems excessive while the 750% seems too low


You have a misunderstanding here actually now Alex, the new 750% IS based on the inaccurate aave math so 750% at slope 2 really gives 182k% at 100% utilised:
|98.00%|87906.81%|
|99.00%|127949.14%|
|100.00%|186210.38%|
(See my question above and @Naguib 's answer too)
I think 182k% is enough, so I back this proposal - but I strongly think it NEEDS the full UI update from Aave to really show the true apy.
182k% is a very large number, and here I would expect it is more than enough to reward AMPL lenders - it is a risk trade off between super long ampl maxis who want to hold ampl spot and take the risk of it swinging the other way , compared to pure farmers who supply liquidity and want to earn in the short term and not hold ampl long as a portfolio hold. I see it as just a safe vs risky tranche basically.",36,96.8,2021-08-20
['ARC: Update AMPL interest rate curve to account for over-approximation in compounded interest'],"I believe @Alex_BertoG was referring to the fact that a 750% expected APY even after translating to 182k% effective APY still doesn’t reach the daily expected interest rate needed to prevent a liquidity crunch on high rebase days. I agree with her, and don’t think APY is the correct metric to use when discussing this issue. The rebase battles are fought day by day, so it is more appropriate to look at the effective daily rate.
Users being unable to withdraw from AAVE is a very bad situation and needs to be avoided. I don’t think simply raising interest rates is a perfect solution for the reasons @BlockEnthusiast pointed out in the other thread. Even if the daily APR is equal to the rebase, this won’t stop liquidity from being unavailable in the moments leading up to the rebase. So raising interest rates should only have the effect of reducing the amount of time that withdrawals are unavailable. This is an improvement, but this solution is hostile to borrowers and creates instability in the market.
@Naguib Great find on the formula issue. This appears to be the simple interest rate model, and from what I understand about the mechanics of AAVE, the rate is updated every time someone interacts with the lending pool. Assuming that the lending pool is interacted with often, doesn’t this mean that what we were calling APY is essentially APR?",37,77.0,2021-08-20
['ARC: Update AMPL interest rate curve to account for over-approximation in compounded interest'],"Thanks @Alex_BertoG  for summarizing comments from the previous ARC! Responses to different points below.

The AMPL reserved was fully utilised at multiple occasions and for lengthy periods with depositors unable to withdraw the liquidity they deposited since rational actors were borrowing the available liquidity to take advantage of the superior yield offered by the rebasing.

This was the case with ~60% APY. Which was clearly low and it was expected prelaunch that an adjustment will be needed after the launch. Deriving from the behavior at max ~60% APY that the needed APY is as high as 6,565,963,106% (The equivalent of 5% daily) is a big stretch.

To avoid this situation again, I believe that the max borrow rate should be aligned with the rebasing returns

While avoiding 100% utilization is a major goal there are other factors at play.
Setting an APY as high as 6M%:

Will be costly to long term borrowers due to the potential short lived but very high interest rates.
The sensitivity of such very steep curve to utilization will make the borrowing market very unpredictable reducing its utility.

The proposed curve above at its maximum daily interest is equivalent to rebase amount at VWAP $1.26.
The frequency of days that far from the target are reducing over time and no sign that that will change. Over the previous 90 days, it is at 4.44% of the days. Further increasing interest rates to optimize for 4% of the time that’s expected to keep going down at the expense of the utility of the other 96% of the time. Is not a great balance.

It seems the interest rate model max rate should cover this scenario as it’s not sustainable to call upon governance for frequent parameters adjustments.

In AAVE’s implementation the frequency of interactions doesn’t affect the interest accrued so the final value is deterministic. The way to describe AAVE’s interest in terms of APR is that it is APR compounded every second.",38,32.2,2021-08-20

How is this a stretch? It only seems like a stretch when you use APY as the metric. The max APY will very rarely be actually realized, so it is far more realistic to look at APR. Also, if 60% APY was clearly low and your team expected an adjustment prelaunch, why is this only being mentioned now? How come this wasn’t mentioned in the original proposal? I’m going to have to call BS on this one.



 Naguib:

The frequency of days that far from the target are reducing over time and no sign that that will change. Over the previous 90 days, it is at 4.44% of the days.


I don’t buy this either. The burden of proof should be a lot higher than what you’re presenting here. The sample size for high rebase numbers is extremely low over a 90 day period, so in terms of statistical significance, I don’t think there’s much evidence to support this assertion.



 Naguib:

Further increasing interest rates to optimize for 4% of the time that’s expected to keep going down at the expense of the utility of the other 96% of the time. Is not a great balance.


I’m uncertain of what expense you are referring to here. On the other 96% of the days, there will be little to no borrowing demand if we go off of the short history we have, so borrowers will be unaffected for those 96% of days.



 Naguib:

In AAVE’s implementation the frequency of interactions doesn’t affect the interest accrued so the final value is deterministic. The way to describe AAVE’s interest in terms of APR is that it is APR compounded every second.

The other factors at play are

Clever borrowers will try to enter and exit exactly around rebase to minimize fees paid.
Clever lenders will try to exit end enter exactly around rebase to minimize realized loss in cases of positive rebase.

No matter what you will be getting 100% utilization.
While we discuss to APY, we are not considering the time borrowed. Please read my previous post where I demonstrate that at $1.27 (sorry didn’t map $1.26) 1,436,657% APR for 1 minute entry / exit around rebase.

Screenshot from 2021-08-22 04-07-281835×554 49.2 KB

I literally broke the APY calculator converting that APR and I don’t think we can reach infinite APY.
I don’t think you are really considering the more nefarious usage, and because of that, you are overlooking this massive problem. It will always get 100% utilized in positive rebase, and charging more interest doesn’t solve that, because interest is counting on continuous borrows where the borrower does not know the directionality that an asset will move or by how much. Here, a borrower knows exactly how much, and when.
Potentially with some MEV prevention techniques around rebase, we could get that window up to 15 minutes from 1, but that still does not adequately negate the problem.
I think you should consider options to hedge risk, where daily settlement can be explicit, and time to rebase can be taken into account as a market price rather than unaccounted for as interest.",35,96.8,2021-08-22

Those are considered factors too.

I disagree that they have or will have a significant effect in the whole lending market when considering diverse market actors.
I agree that these factors aren’t to be addressed through the interest rate curve and other mitigations are to be considered if need be.

I didn’t verify the numbers in your analysis, if you are interested in a deeper response to your analysis when mentioning APR please clarify the length or number of compounding period just saying APR in this context on its own is ambiguous. In traditional finance APR is usually referring to APR compounded monthly which is rarely what is being referred to in the context of DeFi lending. For analysis purposes it is always better to use accrued interest for a specific period or APY as those aren’t ambiguous.",34,46.6,2021-08-23
['ARC: Update AMPL interest rate curve to account for over-approximation in compounded interest'],"I always use flat no compounding for APR since APY has ambiguity around epochs. Maybe in trade fi it includes compounding, but from my experience in DeFi, its targets just rate of return vs liquidity without compounding unless a built in compounding product in whichcase often APY is used as the qualifier. IMO, its always better to use flat APR so various users can apply their own epochs as directly as possible.
I included the formula in the most important chart, 1 min, but apologies, my poor cropping cut it off in the others.
Borrow Rate = (Rebase Amount Earned By Borrowers / Borrowed Amount) * period
Where the period is 365 for reward earned over 1 day and 525,600 for reward earned over 1 minute.
This should equate the rate someone would earn in that period, and so an equivalent borrow rate reflects a neutral market where both the lender and borrower net neutral over the period.

Do you disagree that diverse market actors will have to factor into their models squeezes towards 100% utilization will likely occur, and the respective consequences on interested and withdrawals during certain periods.

Lets reflect on the AMM example. Yes, Liquidity Providers are earning fees as to be expected, but if not synced they’d have rebase siphoned out by those entering and exiting around rebase. In that context, while the market will continue to work regardless of actors factoring in this form of value siphoning, any smart actor would take that siphoning risk into consideration as a requirement of participation in such a market. The same goes here from my view, that all market participants must bend their strategies to this risk. If a long term borrower, I will face periods of extremely high interest. I must consider that impact.
Whereas I don’t really care if someone else borrowed LINK and is shorting it, while I arb the curve link rate, I would care if there was suddenly an incentive to borrow LINK for some new farm spike the rate past my return. Why lose money when I can close my position.
AMPL lenders must consider that interest will likely never reach parity with losses under this model in positive rebase. That has an impact on lazy strategies regardless of other people using the pools other ways. Daily rates don’t make sense when I can condense my risk far smaller than a day.
A playground can be used many ways, but if there is a group using it as a paintball field, that will certainly devolve into the only way that playground is used is as a paintball field untill the paintball players leave.

['Announcement: Aave Snapshot Space'],"Hello fellow Aavengers :)
I have exciting news to share with the community: Aave now has a Snapshot space!
You can access the new Snapshot and take a look around here. I’ll share some of the features and potential use cases below.

What is Snapshot?
Snapshot is a gasless, off chain voting mechanism. Token holders can cast votes with only a signed message from their wallet, which removes the need to pay transaction fees to participate in governance.

Snapshot also allows for counting multiple tokens and wrappers in an aggregate measure of voting power. In addition to stkAAVE and AAVE (which are included in Aave’s current on chain governance voting system), the new Snapshot also counts voting power of aAAVE (tokens supplied as collateral to Aave money market), AAVE and aAAVE on the Polygon network, and AAVE held in stkBPT (Balancer pool token staked in safety module). And the system offers lots of flexibility, allowing for additional tokens or networks to be added to the voting score at the discretion of governance.
With less friction and a wider group of eligible voters, we hope that this Snapshot space can further enhance Aave governance participation.
Check out the Snapshot docs for more information, and join their Discord for support if needed.

Snapshot Limitations
While it’s a powerful tool for governance coordination, Snapshot has some key limitations.
Votes are recorded off chain, and it’s not currently possible to trigger on chain effects or protocol changes with the vote results. Because of this, Snapshot votes are most useful for “soft governance” - the process of gauging community support or opposition to a protocol change before putting it up for an on chain vote. The Uniswap community offers an example of this in action with their temperature check / consensus check polls.

Use Cases
I envision Snapshot being particularly helpful for the initial asset listing process. The current forum polling mechanisms are easy to influence with newly created accounts or external users who have no stake in the Aave ecosystem. Using Snapshot gives a more objective view of community support for asset onboarding.
More broadly, Snapshot can be used for governance matters or decisions that don’t require accessing the protocol’s funds or admin functions. For example, the Aave Grants DAO could use Snapshot to get community buy-in on larger grants, and then pay grantees directly from the grants multisig.

Metagovernance and Moderation
Ultimate authority over the Snapshot page rests with the owner of the Aave.eth ENS name. These powers can be delegated to designated admins, who then have the power to change settings and remove spam proposals from the front end interface. Currently state and I are admins, but the ENS owner can add new admins or revoke these powers at their discretion.
Any user with at least 1 AAVE worth of total voting power (counting all of the types of Aave token included in voting) can create a vote on Snapshot. This allows for maximum openness to the community, but if spam proposals become an issue this threshold can be raised to a higher amount. Admins can also submit a proposal regardless of their personal voting power, allowing for a more guarded approach to governance if the community wishes.

Suggested Proposal Standards
Here are some initial ground rules I’d recommend for submitting Snapshot votes:

Voting period should start at least 24 hours in the future
Voting period should last at least 3 days
Poll question and choices should use neutral phrasing (avoid introducing bias)
Poll should include an abstain option (allows for participation without influencing vote)
Poll text should link to a discussion on the Aave forum to allow for feedback and suggestions

I expect we’ll develop additional best practices as this tool sees more use in the Aave governance process. If anyone has questions or suggestions around Snapshot, please share below!

['Grant received to create an Aave quest on RabbitHole'],"Hello Aave community! My name is Ben and I am the Operations Lead at RabbitHole.
For those who don’t know, RabbitHole is a platform where users can earn crypto by using new crypto applications. For projects like Aave, we provide the best tool to find new users and to incentivize them to interact with certain parts of your product.
We recently received a $50k grant from the Aave Grants DAO and we wanted to post about how we were thinking about using our grant so that we could get the community’s input.
Summary
We would like to use our Aave grant to create a “Quest” on rabbithole.gg that rewards RabbitHole users for depositing tokens into any of the Polygon markets on the Aave app. Each user that RabbitHole verifies, up to the first 2k, will split $40k in rewards paid out in Aave (approximately .09 Aave as of 6/23).
Rationale
Our quest will help increase the TVL of the Aave Polygon markets and will introduce new users to the Aave community, who will hopefully meaningfully contribute to the community long-term.
We are proposing incentivizing users to deposit funds in the Polygon markets because:

Low gas prices on Polygon will help new users get the most bang for their buck
Polygon liquidity is lower so we can drive more relative value by focusing there

Specification
We will launch a new quest on the RabbitHole website that rewards users for depositing funds into Aave Polygon markets.
Quest steps:

Connect wallet to Aave on Polygon.
Deposit funds into any of the Polygon markets on Aave.
Confirm completion on RabbitHole to claim prize at the end of the quest.

Users who need more guidance with tasks such as transferring funds to Polygon will be given relevant guides and materials.

The $50k grant that RabbitHole received will be split 80% to the users as rewards and 20% to the RabbitHole DAO.
The quest will run for a two-week period.
The first 2000 users to do the tasks and confirm proof on RabbitHole by signing a message will split $40k paid out in Aave (approximately .09 Aave per user as of 6/23)

RabbitHole integrates Sybil protection through BrightID to ensure limit of one redemption per user.


These users will also be awarded an Aave themed NFT.
The Aave tokens received by the RabbitHole DAO will be locked for 1 year and will be used actively in governance as a DAO delegate.

Conclusion
RabbitHole is the best way for treasuries to spend directly on user acquisition and we hope to use our Aave grant to do just that. Moving forward, we hope that this is the start of a long-term relationship with Aave where we can help Aave incentivize any on-chain action that is important to Aave’s success, including proposal creation, voting, delegating, and more.
We are interested to hear the community’s input on our proposed plan and we look forward to hopefully implementing the quest soon!",43,2848.6,2021-06-23

In turn, we expect some percentage of these users to stick around and become larger parts of the Aave community.
Our opinion is that creating lock-ups or minimum deposits would ultimately preclude some portion of people from participating and would detract from our primary goal of getting people involved in Aave.",33,81.6,2021-06-24

We also do not want to require new users to be at risk for liquidation, no matter how conservative the collateral is, especially since we are trying to onboard users who may not be as familiar with these tasks.
Moving forward, we are looking to integrate credentials into our platform, which would allow us to require users to be experienced borrowers to engage in this task. At that point, it would feel much more attractive to us!",22,34.4,2021-06-28

['ARC: Liquidation Bonus Updates'],"
Simple Summary
A proposal to reduce the liquidation bonus for ten (10) Aave V2 assets.

Abstract
In Gauntlet’s Market Risk Assessment, Liquidation Retrospective: May 2021, and recent ARC for Dynamic Risk Parameters we highlighted the importance of optimizing liquidation bonuses.
For background,

If the bonus is too low, then during extremely volatile or illiquid conditions, liquidators might not be profitable even with the bonus. During these times, there can also be cascading, systemic effects from a lack of liquidations. For each loan that is liquidated, liquidators purchasing the collateral and selling it causes the price to further decrease causing further liquidations. On the other hand, if the bonus is too high, suppliers are losing out on profits to liquidators. Continual monitoring and adjustment of this parameter is crucial for optimizing the security vs. capital efficiency trade-off in Aave.


Motivation
Large liquidation bonuses increase the regime in which the incentives are counterproductive. See section 6.3. Lower liquidation bonuses for a single week in May would have mitigated $4M in depositor losses while maintaining a low risk of insolvency.

User experience is another factor worth considering. Depositor losses occurred for 590 distinct users during the week of May 17-23. Mitigating losses without increasing the net insolvent value percentage or the slashing run percentage is possible.

['Proposal : A decentralized and public Aave frontend'],"Hello,
The network/protocol is decentralized but we have to go through an aave.com interface, what happens if the site is down for x or y reason? We can certainly use smart contract but who is able to do it without interface / frontend?
We can use zapper, instadapp, defisaver and others but we depend on their smart contract and protocol too.
Why not set up a public frontend? Which can be different from aave.com (lighter version) but which allows to interact with everything that is possible to do today on aave.com and on smartcontract?
Moreover if the frontend is public and decentralized, it is possible to add the latest features that are available on the protocol more quickly.
Other advantages : We will have the possibility to create mirrors
Risk : Possibility that someone change the addresses of the smart contract in the frontend if they decide to fork it and make a fake.
In any case I want to open the discussion on this eventuality and take the measure.
Moreover an Aave app seems to be in dev, is it public ? decentralized ? where is the border ?
If the protocol is decentralized, the interface must be too, otherwise we are dependent (for a large part of the users) on the goodwill of the person responsible for the publication of the frontend.
Of course all the frontend work is fabulous, but so far we are waiting for the new releases with impatience and we have no choice on the frontend, the date, etc …
Best Regards,
Kwizfreak

['Proposal : A decentralized and public Aave frontend'],"In the announcement on Medium there are a number of good reasons why open sourcing the UI is important:

Facilitating integrations
Possibiliting alternative and enhanced user experiences
Enabling anyone to contribute and improve the UI

However,  I think there are a couple of reasons more that can’t be overlooked:

The front-end code of dApps need to be publicly auditable so that anyone can verify the security and integrity of the code. That is, making sure that the front-end is free from privacy-endangering or money-endangering code and that it doesn’t contain some evil logic (e.g. secretly interacting with a different implementation of the the protocol that is not the one that has been audited and published).
Users who want to have a truly end-to-end trustless experience need to have some way to locally run the UI from the source code. Only in that way they know the dApp they are using is exactly the code that is publlished on GitHub. Moreover, that’s also the best way for them to protect their privacy, as the version of the UI that is live on app.aave.com is leaking IP addresses and potentially many other data to a number of web servers, including some third parties:

['Proposal: Crosschain Governance Test'],"As described in AIP-28, a proposal has been created to test a cross-chain governance workflow in which Aave governance controls and updates a mock Aave market deployed on Polygon. In order to have Aave markets on other chains controlled by Aave governance on Ethereum, new bridging functionality needs to be introduced. Smart contracts in the governance-crosschain-bridges repo have been built specifically for this purpose and the goal of this proposal is to test those contracts and the cross-chain governance workflow in a mainnet environment.
This test proposal includes three updates to a mock Polygon Market:

disable the mock dai reserve via the LendingPoolConfigurator contract
Set the pool admin to the address 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD via the LendingPoolAddressesProvider contract
Transfer ownership of the pool to the address 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001 via the LendingPoolAddressesProvider contract

If this proposal is executed, it will send a cross-chain message from Aave governance, to the Polygon network. A new contract PolygonBridgeExecutor, will receive and queue this message. A guardian address will have three days to cancel the proposed action. After those three days, anyone can call execute() on this contract to trigger the market updates to the mock Aaave Polygon Market.

Summary
FRAX is a redeemable stablecoin with a dynamic collateral ratio that adjusts based on market demand. Frax is unique among recent stablecoin designs in that each FRAX is always redeemable for $1.00 worth of assets from the Frax protocol. This has kept the price of FRAX in a relatively tight band around $1.00, making Frax an ideal asset to borrow and lend against on Aave. Frax is already integrating with Aave and is currently the 4th largest aUSDC holder and growing, demonstrating a strong synergy between the communities.
v2 of the Frax protocol was recently announced and introduces a lending module that can be built directly onto Aave. This would enable the Frax protocol to supply large amounts of FRAX to Aave on demand. The first step towards this integration is the addition of FRAX and FXS as assets on Aave.
Overview
FRAX is a redeemable stablecoin with a dynamic collateral ratio that adjusts based on the market demand for FRAX. Currently, each FRAX is collateralized by approximately $0.87 USDC and $0.13 of the Frax governance token, FXS. When the price of FRAX is at or above $1.00, the protocol gradually lowers the collateralization ratio of USDC to FXS. When the price of FRAX is below $1.00, the protocol gradually increases the ratio. FRAX can always be minted or redeemed by the protocol for $1.00 of assets, which counterbalances significant price deviations from the $1.00 target. Frax emphasizes a highly autonomous approach with no active management of the price stability function.
The Frax community recently approved the investment of system collateral, currently approximately $96m USDC, into yield bearing USDC. Accordingly, the protocol began supplying USDC to Aave to earn a return on this collateral. Frax already has over 15,000,000 aUSDC and will continue increasing deposits on Aave, demonstrating a strong synergy between the Frax and Aave communities. Frax is currently the #4 largest holder  of aUSDC. Continued growth of the Frax protocol and system collateral could lead to Frax becoming one of the larger suppliers of USDC to Aave.
Positioning within Aave Ecosystem
The Frax community is very active and looking for venues to lend and borrow FRAX. Aave should enjoy increased revenue from the lending and borrowing of FRAX, as well as additional USDC deposits as the Frax collateral pool grows. While Frax is often lumped together with “algorithmic stablecoin” protocols, a closer analysis shows that the Frax protocol is in fact stable and capital efficient.
Frax recently announced v2 of the Frax protocol. v2 introduces algorithmic market operations controllers (AMOs). AMOs are autonomous contracts that build on the base Frax protocol without disrupting it’s operation. The team has proposed incorporating lending AMOs directly into decentralized lending markets. The lending AMO could be built directly on Aave to supply large amounts of FRAX from the protocol to Aave. This would effectively create a FRAX dispenser on Aave, somewhat analogous to the Fed discount window, where borrowers could borrow directly from the FRAX protocol via Aave. A direct integration with Aave will also make supplying FRAX more attractive to other market participants because there is a guarantee of FRAX liquidity directly from the protocol, avoiding the pitfalls of high utilization rates on money markets. This integration could drive significant TVL and fees to Aave.
A direct integration with Frax via a lending AMO contract will offer Aave users the ability to effectively mint and redeem stablecoins on demand via Aave. From a borrower’s perspective, direct protocol integration should keep the supply relatively steady, which should keep borrowing costs low and predictable. This would make FRAX an ideal stablecoin to borrow. To realize this integration, FRAX and FXS need to first be added as collateral on Aave.
Project History
The project launched in December 2020. The project is currently using snapshot voting for governance. The project has deployed Compound Governor Alpha; it is fully functional but awaiting the minimal threshold of FXS to be emitted. There is a 48 hour timelock for governance.
Frax underwent a significant expansion and contraction withing the first 2 months of launch, providing a stress test for the protocol. In a three week period, the supply of FRAX increased over 5x, from approximately 25m to 134m. The supply of FRAX then contracted by approximately 33%. FRAX maintained a tight band around $1.00 throughout the cycle. The team has subsequently released updates to the protocol to smooth volatility during expansions and contractions, most importantly the updated PID controller for the protocol. V2 of the protocol also includes an interest rate module, intended to dampen FXS volatility during periods of contraction.
Given that FRAX is a stablecoin, FRAX’s stability around $1.00 is obviously important and worth reviewing.  Warp Capital performed the following analysis independently in February.  There have been no notable changes or deviations for FRAX since this analysis was performed:
From inception FRAX has maintained the peg of $1, trading within the normal range. Figure 1 illustrates the USD price for the last 30 days of stablecoins from different groups: fiat-backed like BUSD, GUSD etc.; algorithmic with overcollaterization like sUSD, DAI; elastic like AMPL and algoseignorage like BAC, ESD and FRAX. The noticeable divergence is present for BAC and ESD – fully algoseignorage without any collateral. Also, elastic AMPL converges to the peg with the high volatility.

Figure 1. Last 30 days stablecoins performance vs. USD

image2406×1028 339 KB

Figure 2. Last 30 day performance without 3 aforementioned algorithmic stablecoins that have experienced high volatility (AMPL, BAC, ESD). As we see FRAX goes in line with other stablecoins demonstrating alike volatility.

Figure 3. Last 30 day stablecoin performance vs USD excluding sUSD.
If we exclude sUSD which has the big spike at the beginning of 2021, we will get the performance illustrated on Figure 3. Figure 3 shows the dynamics of the remaining stablecoins and as we see FRAX is within the range of other stablecoins.
Here is an updated view of FRAX’s stability taken from the FRAX app:

Given that FRAX is highly collateralized (currently approximately 87% collateralized by USDC and interest bearing USDC like aUSDC) and FRAX’s initial Aave LTV is likely to be lower than the collateralized amount, there is a high likelihood that FRAX used as collateral on Aave would effectively be over collateralized by USDC and equivalents.  This should reduce the downside risk for Aave as a protocol.
It is also worth noting that there is also approximately $60m of Uniswap, Sushiswap and FRAX-3Pool LP tokens locked within the Frax protocol.  A significant portion of this is locked for greater than 2 years.  This provides guaranteed liquidity for FRAX and provides significant benefits to the stability of the protocol in times of volatility.
FRAX Usage and Emission
FRAX is a stablecoin that can be freely minted and redeemed via the Frax protocol.  Currently, Frax is mostly used in AMM trading pairs and to liquidity mine the Frax governance token, FXS.  Through constant building (FRAX AMOs as an example), integrations (like Aave) and performance / awareness over time, FRAX should build organic usage as a stablecoin.  The team has no ability to arbitrarily mint or redeem FRAX in the contract.
Market, Social and Contract Data
FRAX currently has a $110m market capitalization with an average daily volume of $9m during March 2021.  FRAX is the #9 token on Uniswap based on liquidity ($102m)
Frax’s telegram is the main social channel with 5,600+ members. The contracts were deployed December 16 2020. There have been 53k transfers and currently 851 holders, however 97.5% of the supply is currently deposited as liquidity on decentralized exchanges.  Given Frax liquidity mining, it is likely that significantly more users exist but have staked their tokens in liquidity pools to receive rewards.
Security Considerations
Frax has undergone extensive code reviews and an audit by Certik (linked above). Frax is in the process of undergoing additional audits. The protocol currently has approximately $300m TVL.
I appreciate you taking the time to review. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

FRAX is a redeemable decentralized stablecoin with a dynamic collateral ratio that adjusts based on market demand. FRAX can be minted or redeemed for $1.00 worth of assets from the Frax protocol.  At the current market set collateral ratio, over $0.85 of each FRAX is backed by USDC, while the balance is backed by the Frax governance token FXS.
If onboarded to Aave, FRAX can be supplied for yield or borrowed against collateral, introducing new borrow and lend demand for Aave. FRAX has emerged as a compelling alternative to centralized stablecoins and an integration with Aave brings more utility to the FRAX ecosystem.
FRAX Smart contract Risk: C
The FRAX contract launched in December 2020 and has a smaller number of transactions when compared with other stablecoins on Aave.  The FRAX contracts have undergone extensive code reviews and audit, while holding a TVL over $300m.  The FRAX contracts have also gone through a major FRAX expansion and contraction cycle without issue.
FRAX Counterparty Risk: C+
FRAX has a limited number of holders, however the protocol acts as the largest market participant where all FRAX can be redeemed for $1.00 of assets at any time.  The FRAX contract has no permissions, including minting or redeeming FRAX, though the Pool contract has a function to pause the minting and redemption of protocol collateral in an emergency.
FRAX Market Risk: B
FRAX has a healthy market cap for a growing stablecoin ($132MM).  While FRAX has a reasonable average daily volume, it does not account for any mints or redemptions directly from the protocol.  In the event Aave users need to exit a large position of FRAX, the protocol will redeem 1 FRAX for $1.00 of collateral.  The protocol programmatically holds enough collateral to back the entire supply of FRAX at FRAX’s collateral ratio.  FRAX has been successful in keeping a tight band around $1.00.  The volatility calculations for this risk assessment use Coingecko daily data, which appears consistent with other Aave Community Risk Assessments.  Using more granular data (without an artificial daily closing price), FRAX’s volatility is likely lower and approaches fully collateralized stablecoins.
FRAX is widely traded on DEXs including Uniswap and Curve. The Uniswap FRAX-USDC pool holds $121MM in liquidity and facilitates ~$2MM in 24 hour trade volume.
A FRAX-USD Chainlink oracle feed is in progress.

Frax Overall Risk: B-
FRAX’s overall risk score is largely reflective of FRAX’s age.  FRAX performs well from a stablecoin and market risk perspective, however this is offset by the age of the protocol.
Given that each FRAX is redeemable for $1.00 of collateral from the Frax protocol, FRAX as a collateral asset at 65% LTV is 153% collateralized.  The collateral can be permissionlessly redeemed at any time.
Proposed Risk Parameters:
LTV	65%
Liquidation Threshold	70%
Liquidation Bonus	5%
Reserve Factor	10%
Variable Interest Rate Model:
UOptimal 80%
R_0 0%
R_s1 4%
R_s2 75%
Rationale
A 65% LTV is 15% lower than USDC and 10% lower than DAI and True USD.	
Stablecoins on Aave have historically followed the same curve with an 80% UOptimal in line with BUSD, DAI, GUSD, sUSD, and TUSD. A 0% Base and 4% Slope 1 follows all stablecoins onboarded to Aave. A 75% slope 2 presents a risk profile in between USDC/USDT (60%) and sUSD, GUSD, and BUSD (100%).

About 15% of FRAX is backed algorithmically by FXS. Without fully reviewing the liquidity, governance, and distribution of the FXS token, I think we should mark this portion as a 0% collateral factor.
The frax-3crv AMO makes up another 25% of reserves. This is exposed to USDT through the Curve 3pool, and considering the high liquidity amplification in the 3pool the downside risk is nearly equivalent to holding USDT directly. Aave gives USDT a 0% collateral factor, so marking this portion to 0% as well makes sense to me.
Yearn’s yUSDC vault is also exposed to USDT risk through participation in Curve pools. So this additional 20% should also be market to 0% collateral factor in my view.
The remaining 40% of reserves is composed of USDC, aUSDC, and cUSDC. These assets are generally pretty safe and we could mark them to USDC’s 82.5% liquidation ratio.
Granting these assumptions, we get 40% * 82.5% = 33% collateral factor.
While FRAX does have the possibility of being safer than the sum of its parts through diversification, currently it has highly concentrated exposure to USDC and USDT credit risk, plus additional smart contract and governance risks mixed in. Governance can always allocate more funds towards USDT exposure as well, so it could be problematic to grant even a 33% liquidation ratio to FRAX. I think adding FRAX is a good idea, but it would make more sense to give it a 0% liquidation ratio for the time being.",33,91.6,2021-06-07

['Proposal: Add support for FRAX'],"Thanks for your proposal @metalface and your risk analysis @Anjan-ParaFi
The Aave Protocol experiences high borrowing demand with a high appetite for stablecoins. Since FRAX is not fully collateralised by stablecoins, there is a significant risk and so it seems ingenious to start only as a borrowing asset with the risks reflected in the Reserve Factor
I’m surprised to see you have chosen the interest rate strategy of stablecoins with medium to high liquidity such as DAI which has over $2b on Aave
The lower the liquidity the more volatile the utilisation and so the borrow rates. Meaning there is a higher need to protect liquidity to enable depositors to withdraw at anytime
Personally, I believe FRAX could be a good asset to borrow on Aave, but at launch would favor a more aggressive borrowing curve with a variable slope 2 at 100% which has worked well for similar assets such as sUSD and BUSD. As liquidity grows and utilisation stabilises, the parameters could be adjusted

The Aave Treasury Management Vision
Authors from Llama: @MatthewGraham, @AcceleratedCapital, @HelloShreyas,  @Dydymoon, @MSilb7, @yuan-han-li and @Elliott.

Abstract
The vision for the Aave treasury is to encourage innovation, accelerate growth, and prudently manage financial assets, while providing relevant and transparent financial reporting content. As long term believers in Aave, the protocol is to remain overweight $AAVE capturing future growth upside, whilst hedging against the risks of adverse market conditions. Assets are to be deployed productively within the guidance of best asset management practices. Real-time financial metric performance tracking will provide transparency to the community and support decisions around how best the community deploys capital efficiently. Treasury management and financial reporting is in its early days and requires nuanced thinking within crypto, creating an opportunity for Aave to continue being a leader within the space.

Section 1. The Vision

Vision and Goals
The Aave Protocol (referred to herein as “Aave”) is primarily focused on innovation, growth, and developing relationships within the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem. The treasury can support experiment-driven innovation leading to future Aave growth while investing aToken reserve income to earn additional returns. The treasury can be utilised to increase the rate at which aTokens are being accumulated through a variety of productive strategies. The long term vision for the Protocol is for income to consistently exceed operational costs. This self-sustainability will allow Aave to be an active Ethereum and global citizen for years to come.
As a leading protocol, Aave intends to give back to the community through the AaveGrants DAO initiative and alike. The initiative will invest in early stage startup projects that have demonstrated the ability to add value to the ecosystem, attracting contributors to the Aave community and expanding Aave’s network across the DeFi ecosystem. The treasury intends to fund initiatives beyond the grants program that continue to create value for Aave and the broader ecosystem. Like in venture capital, these investments have asymmetric returns profiles capable of generating significant wealth for Aave’s treasury in years to come.
Aave’s treasury contains an overweight AAVE position that provides exposure to the future success and upside in the token price. However, the associated volatility and downside risks are not desirable. As such, Aave is exploring ways to reduce exposure to any meaningful deterioration in market conditions. Positioning the treasury to capture future upside whilst responsibly reducing downside risk is a key medium-term goal of the treasury.
In addition to holding a core position in AAVE and accumulating aTokens, Aave seeks to grow its metagovernance influence throughout the ecosystem to enhance integrations and unlock future opportunities for Aave. Metagovernance influence through alliances and integrations with other protocols/DAOs has the potential to bring asset diversification to the treasury and accelerate market adoption across the ecosystem. Strategic holdings, or joint strategic holdings, have the effect of bringing communities together through collaboration and innovation, becoming a positive-sum add on many levels.

Philosophy
The Aave Treasury ought to be utilised by the community to reflect the values and ambitions of the protocol. The protocol seeks growth and the accumulation of strategic assets, while continuing to be a leading DeFi citizen. Financial capital is to be deployed with holistic oversight, balancing a longer-term vision with consideration towards shorter-term capital planning/management needs. Within the portfolio, a select portion of Aave’s otherwise unproductive capital is to be invested to generate a return. Investing aTokens to earn additional returns is particularly appealing.
The vision for Aave is for aToken revenue to exceed all the expenses of the protocol. This would achieve our goal of inflows exceeding outflows, allowing Aave to fund growth initiatives, like liquidity mining, without reducing the core AAVE holding.
As Aave grows and expands, there becomes an increasing desire to monitor, assess and refine how capital is deployed. The best growth drivers are to be maximised and experiments that fail to gain traction are to be adjusted ensuring Aave is allocating capital and energy as efficiently as possible. Monitoring and improving capital efficiency over time shall utilise on-chain data and be monitored through statistical parameters, whether internally-facing like Return On Investment (ROI) or external-facing like peer-to-peer metrics, eg: Market Share. DeFi is a competitive landscape and understanding how effective initiatives are at driving growth will act to help shape future initiatives.

Governance
A Treasury Committee is to be created consisting of 5 community-elected individuals from within Aave and Llama. The committee will help shape how the treasury is managed, as well as ensuring there is open and transparent communication and alignment across the broader Aave ecosystem. The standard ARC and AIP process will be followed for all treasury management-related actions. Any code developed for managing the parts of the treasury will need to go through a review cycle before being implemented. Snapshot is to be used as a tool to gauge community sentiment towards particular ideas. This means that the Treasury Committee will have no direct execution power; the committee’s role would be purely advisory in nature and it is Llama’s intent that the committee becomes a trusted first point of contact for the community in all matters related to treasury management.

Section 2. Asset Management

Introduction
The Aave treasury is to retain an overweight allocation to AAVE, accelerate growth through strategic investments, and hedge against adverse market conditions. In this section we will introduce the key concepts that influence the overall portfolio construction from an asset management perspective.

Portfolio Construction
Risk Management
Liquidity Considerations
Borrowing
Hedging
Productivity

Further details are to be provided within the Investment Policy Statement (IPS) publication.

Portfolio Construction
The Aave Treasury’s composition is currently highly concentrated in AAVE governance tokens. A concentrated position subjects the portfolio to a higher level of risk. In order to mitigate the risks of a concentrated position, a variety of diversification tactics can be employed:

Hedging to modify the risk profile
Monetization strategies utilising AAVE as collateral and reinvesting
Selling to diversify

Given the early-stage nature of Aave’s business, it is recommended that Aave maintain their concentrated position and instead look at hedging and monetization strategies to redeploy capital without requiring a sale.
Capital that is generated from these strategies can be redeployed into the Protocol in order to accumulate a diversified portfolio of aTokens. These interest-bearing tokens serve two major purposes: 1) they allow Aave to generate a yield on the investment portfolio; and 2) they are an investment into the Protocol itself.
Since the AAVE token is highly correlated to the broader DeFi sector, which is a highly volatile sub-asset class of the crypto industry, the most immediate need within the portfolio construction framework is to reduce total portfolio volatility by allocating to stablecoins. This will theoretically increase the return relative to the standard deviation as exemplified by investment metrics such as the Sharpe ratio. In addition, allocating to tokens with lower correlations to AAVE will help smooth total volatility while allowing the Protocol to invest across the ecosystem.
The strategic asset allocation will be outlined in the Investment Policy Statement. The goal of this piece is to note the core functions of the portfolio construction framework:

Offset the risk profile of the existing Aave position by reinvesting generated capital into a diversified portfolio of less correlated and less volatile assets.
Maximize total return relative to standard deviation. This is done through diversification and deployment of capital into productive assets (e.g., aTokens).
Utilize derivatives where applicable to tweak risk exposures to suit the needs of the Aave treasury (e.g., hedging either directly or indirectly the downside price movements of the AAVE token in order to preserve purchasing power during periods of market volatility).


Risk Management
All treasury management activities, including portfolio construction, use of derivatives/leverage, balance sheet modifications such as the deployment of debt, and more, should be guided by the risk management framework. The primary goal should be to maximize the return on treasury assets for a given level of risk.
Risk considerations for the Aave treasury include, but are not limited to:

Market Risk
Liquidity Risk
Smart Contract Risks
Administrative Control Risks
Technical Risks

The specific mechanisms and constraints used to balance these risks will be outlined in the IPS and the strategy proposal. For now, our goal is to highlight that risk management is an essential component of the treasury management process and will play a major role in determining suitability of investments and other capital structure decisions relating to the DAO’s treasury function.

Liquidity Considerations
One of the core considerations of any potential treasury asset allocation decision is capital contingency. There is an ongoing requirement to fund operations and ensure that unexpected expenses can be funded as they arise. This necessitates a proper understanding of the operational expenses, which will be fleshed out in the financial reporting. This understanding can then be used to guide a working capital management program that ensures there is sufficient investment in assets that can be quickly liquidated without any significant adverse impact.
After ensuring operational needs are accounted for, illiquidity can be used to capture higher returns. Theoretically, and as part of the analysis when making an investment, illiquid assets (e.g. seed stage investments or strategic cross-DAO partnerships with defined lock-up terms) should capture a return premium relative to liquid assets. This is why so many endowments today have shifted their asset allocations from public equities into private equity alternatives. Aave should not fear illiquidity as long as the premium is justified for the level of risk and operational expenses are properly funded, including a buffer for unexpected spending requirements.
Our bias will remain for liquid assets considering DeFi’s innovations in financial engineering to counteract illiquidity. However, an allocation to illiquid investments can still be suitable. We would recommend that illiquid investments be limited to a maximum of 50% of the treasury portfolio at any particular time, which is in line with the mean endowment allocation to illiquid alternatives. In practice, we would expect illiquidity to remain much lower than this maximum.

Borrowing
Enabling otherwise passive and unproductive assets to generate an income has the potential to significantly improve the value capture of Aave. By using passive assets as collateral and borrowing capital to be invested productively, otherwise unproductive assets become a source of income for Aave. Positive income generating allocations are highly accretive over any extended time horizon as returns compound.
Deploying capital to earn a return involves taking risks. These risks should be understood and evaluated. The details around how risk will be managed is to be presented within the IPS document. The vision is to develop profitable strategies with known risks that fit within a broader portfolio and holistic risk management framework.
For collateral to loan valuation risks, the positions can be automatically managed with DeFi Saver for Maker, or manually using the “Repay with collateral” feature on Aave to avoid liquidation.

Early Stage Investments
Given that Aave protocol is at its earlier stages, one of its top priorities is funding projects that help Aave grow and expand. AaveGrants DAO was set up to build a thriving ecosystem of Aave contributors and fund projects that grow Aave protocol. Aave DAO can take this to the next level by making early stage investments to help these projects scale.
Early stage investments can be sourced from the following areas:

Aave Grants DAO recipients and applicants
Gitcoin grants recipients and Gitcoin hackathon winners, especially teams participating in the Aave track
ETHGlobal hackathon winners, especially teams participating in the Aave track
Ecosystem development efforts in the broader Ethereum community

Thought needs to be put into the criteria, diligence, process, and structuring of these early stage investments. They will constitute a more illiquid and higher beta portion of the treasury allocation and therefore should be a small portion of the total treasury size. These investments can serve as long-term bets that strategically benefit Aave protocol.

DAO Alliances and Integrations
Aave DAO can utilize token swaps to form alliances with other DAOs. Alliances can help Aave with integrating relevant products, improving TVL, and increasing stablecoin deposits. Alliances are also very useful for DAOs to help each other in times of need, such as during smart contract exploits. For example, Yearn has built trust with DAOs like Pickle and Rari Capital by helping them when they were exploited. Monetarily aligning DAOs via token swaps increases the possibilities for collaboration. Aave can serve as a mesh network for various protocols and DAOs. Unlike early stage investments, token swaps will typically be with more mature DAOs whose tokens have more liquidity.

Hedging
Key aspects of treasury management include retaining the value accrued, maintaining upside exposure, and mitigating the impact of material reductions in the spot market prices of key assets. In traditional finance there are many ways to mitigate downward market moves with the use of derivatives. Various types of derivatives, like options, offer skewed asymmetric returns profiles that enable small capital allocations to provide oversized asset price protection.
For example, a rolling long put option strategy can be an efficient way to hedge against downside risk. This strategy involves purchasing put contracts that provide the holder with the right to sell an asset at the price specified in the contract.
There is not yet any option market for AAVE. However, given the high correlation between AAVE and other assets like ETH during periods of high volatility, there exists the opportunity to explore indirect hedging strategies provided there is suitable on-chain liquidity. Other opportunities for hedging with VIX style volatility derivatives are likely to be available in the near future as well. As on-chain liquidity improves in protocols like CVI, and new coin specific VIX markets are developed, the assets held within the Aave treasury can be hedged more directly through volatility positions.

Productivity
The Aave Treasury intends to utilise a portion of its AAVE holding to further boost the liquidity of aTokens within the Ethereum ecosystem and provide a new source of income to the Reserve Factor (RF).
In broad terms, the approach is to deposit AAVE tokens from the RF into Aave or Maker, draw stable coins and deposit the stables to receive aTokens. Any loan would be sufficiently well capitalised to avoid liquidation and allow the Aave community to have exposure to any price action in the AAVE token. aTokens can then be used throughout DeFi to earn additional income.
There are many opportunities to earn additional income utilising aTokens across DeFi. Common yield strategies include providing liquidity on various decentralised exchanges to earn yield and receive incentives. Some Liquidity Provider (LP) tokens can serve as collateral, or can be staked to receive additional incentives, and even receive boosted returns through depositing the native governance token into a contract.
In addition to generating a more normalised return, there exists opportunities to build relationships, and/or use early stage protocols offering new use cases for aTokens or offer high levels of incentives. Such use cases have a higher risk profile, require in-depth research, and any allocation is to be sized to fit within a broader portfolio risk profile.
Given the size of the RF, there exists the potential to deploy several income-generating strategies to the benefit of the Aave community. Different strategies require different levels of oversight, offer different levels of returns, and contain differing amounts of risk. The vision for the productive allocation within Aave is diversifying across a range of income generating strategies and wherever possible supporting growth/integrations within the ecosystem.

Section 3. Financial Reporting/Performance

Introduction
Aave’s goal is to provide relevant and transparent financial reporting/analysis to facilitate open and informed discussion within the community. Live financial tracking accessible via Dune and/or other platforms will enable performance to be measured in real time. This will provide visibility into what is happening on-chain in an easy to interpret manner and hopefully encourage community members to engage in discussion across the community. Aave intends to provide the following financial insights:

Real Time Data Metrics
Performance Analysis
Financial Reporting

Cash Flow Statement
Balance Sheet
Income Statement


Budgeting / Forecasting Expenses

​​Due to the nascency of financial reporting standards across DeFi, there is a great opportunity for Aave’s financial statements to establish themselves as referential documents in the ecosystem; setting best practices that become ubiquitous. Llama understands the technical nature of financial statements, and we want to be prudent when sharing financial reporting with the community so as to not overwhelm them with new information.

Transparency
For governance of the Aave Treasury to be accessible to the community, there should be open access to data and key metrics. Open access enables any participant to view deep-dive data at any time, and/or be able to fork data sets to create their own analyses. Aave views data transparency as a necessary step to empower the community to make more informed decisions, and understand how various initiatives contribute to Aave’s growth and its positioning among competitors.
Aave will continue to build a public Dune Dashboard that tracks protocol revenue and expenses over time. This will provide the community a real-time view into financial performance and treasury spending. The community could also monitor the Aave treasury’s performance via token holdings and the correlations between what the treasury holds and other assets (i.e. ETH). High level protocol metrics can be shown on Dune, like valuation metrics (i.e. Price/Sales, Earnings per Token), and peer to peer comparison metrics (ie: TVL, Active Addresses). All these data points help to understand the impact of various growth initiatives and how the protocol is performing within the market.
The Aave community will benefit from having open insight into data that provides context for more widely understood product decisions and business model proposals. This includes tracking usage metrics like number of active addresses, transactions by action (i.e. lend, borrow), token affinity with other DeFi apps, and other token holdings.

Financial Reporting
The objective of financial reporting is to provide financial information that is useful in decision-making for present and potential stakeholders. The information in these statements should also serve as a resource in making effective governance decisions. It accomplishes this by helping the community and other stakeholders assess the treasury’s prospects for future net cash flows, which provide payments for treasury operations and also returns to stakeholders.
In the context of Aave, the stakeholders are the ones who make decisions in lending or borrowing from the protocol. The community also includes some stakeholders who play an important role in the future of the protocol through creation and voting on AIPs. Aave’s financial reporting will provide transparency for these stakeholders and the financial information they contain are an important tool for making better-informed decisions.
In traditional accounting, we measure the decision-usefulness of financial reporting in two ways: relevance and faithful representation. Relevance refers to whether the financial reports include line items that are material, comparable between periods, and verifiable. Faithful representation refers to the financial information being complete, free from error, prepared in a timely manner, and understandable. Our approach to Aave’s financial reporting will take these fundamental qualities of decision-useful financials into consideration.
For the relevance quality, we will be using information that is verifiable through Etherscan. For instance, we will be measuring the aTokens that are minted in the Aave treasury as verified on Etherscan, and use publicly available information on interest rates of aTokens in our calculation of interest revenue earned by period.
For the faithful representation quality, we will ensure that we report using transactions from all Aave treasury wallets for v1, v2 and Polygon. While crypto accounting softwares are primitive today, we will be using them to prepare financials in a timely manner, typically 1-2 weeks after month-end for the previous month.
The financial report will consist of multiple financial statements: the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement. The footnotes to these financials are also an integral part of financial reporting and will be included to explain any major transactions that occurred during the periods covered.
Financial reporting will bring better transparency to the aTokens currently held in treasury and their performance over time. Our goal is that this transparency enables insight into Aave’s potential to generate revenue as well as bringing awareness to the importance of financial reporting to all treasury management teams.

Forecasting Expenses
The long-term vision is for all of Aave’s expenses to be funded in perpetuity from income. For now, most of the expenses are paid in AAVE (Staking Rewards, Liquidity minings, grants, etc.) and this is sustainable for a period of time. However, longer term using aTokens (stable coins) to pay expenses allows the community to retain exposure to the future upside in AAVE token price.
Managing the progression from using AAVE to aTokens for paying expenses shall require budgeting for future costs, forecasting future revenue and considering other potential use cases for aTokens. Ultimately, the vision is to have sufficient aToken inflows to accommodate all use cases.

Conclusion
The prior sections outline Aave’ intent to utilise the treasury to the benefit of growing the protocol, advancing the ecosystem and retaining the value generated for the benefit of the community. Investments are to be managed within the context of a broader portfolio construction and risk management framework with real time financial performance reporting. The community is to receive periodic financial reports that are to be relevant and transparent. By following the course of action described above, Aave will move towards a more sophisticated and structured treasury management and financial reporting standard.",59,2706.6,2021-08-04

['The Aave Treasury Management Vision'],"Hi @MatthewGraham
Thanks for sharing your vision and strategy for the treasury
Aave treasury’s major component is the Ecosystem Reserve with AAVE tokens not included in the circulating supply. One thing to consider is as soon as the DAO decides to allocate or exchange them this increases the circulating supply
There are an additional $20m or so mostly collected via the Reserve Factor, held in aToken. These have the significant benefit of accruing yields for borrowing but are on the Aave Protocol
Risk-wise, this means the Aave DAO’s treasury relies exclusively on Aave (either the protocol or the token) leading to very concentrated risks
Really looking forward to a more diversified approach:


Funding growth via grants has strengthened the Aave ecosystem; taking on participation in these early projects could further solidify the benefits in the Aave DAO treasury. This would also encourage further contributions from the Aave DAO members in these early projects


Alliances with other DAOs could also be promising. For example, @Dydymoon Curve Alliance ARC, validated via snapshot, could boost rewards both for depositing on curve.fi and by voting in for aToken Curve LPs


Hedging is also an interesting option, in particular for the Safety Module which is heavily exposed to AAVE


I’ve been really enjoying using the Aave Treasury Dune Dashboard and was impressed to hear @MSilb7 work around to calculate aToken interests with Dune. Aave has just been integrated via a grant to Flipside Crypto which looks exactly like Dune but does capture aToken accrual. Could be interesting to have some similar dashboards across platforms to compare results. Can’t wait to see more of these analytics, would be great to see a live version of Aave Weekly or Monthly for example",23,74.4,2021-08-25
"['ARC: Aave Centrifuge Permissioned ""RWA"" Market Proposal']","Sentence Rational
END_Bridge with the support of Centrifuge is proposing to add a Real World Assets (“RWA”) permissioned market on Aave to enable businesses to finance their tokenized financial assets using crypto and allow investors to diversify their portfolio with uncorrelated, stable assets.

Paragraph Summary
Our goal is to launch the first (permissioned) market for Real World Assets (RWA) on the Aave protocol. This will allow Aave depositors to earn yield against stable, uncorrelated real world collateral while Centrifuge asset originators can borrow money from Aave, automatically balance capital needs and provide an alternative collateral to volatile crypto assets. Currently, there are 10 pools live on the Tinlake protocol, ranging from real estate, to supply chain financings, to music streaming invoices.

Motivation
RWA bear monumental potential for DeFi in regards to volume, adoption and risk diversification. Pioneering lending in DeFi, Aave could be the game changer for millions of businesses by providing instant, bankless liquidity. When bridging the regulated world of Tradfi to trustless DeFi you encounter challenges that only few in DeFi have taken on so far. Centrifuge is planning to make use of the new permissioned pool feature on Aave which is designed to be compliant with AML regulations and US securities guidelines. The pool itself will be public on Ethereum but only accessible to those that undergo KYC verification.
Each Tinlake pool has two tokens: DROP and TIN. DROP is the senior tranche token, protected by the TIN token, which takes first losses. We want to use these DROP tokens as collateral, for borrowing DAI. Please note that there is one DROP token per Tinlake pool (e.g. NewSilver: real estate backed loans, NS2-DROP; ConsolFreight: trade finance txs, CF4-DROP). Currently the majority of Tinlake pools are denominated in Dai, meaning liquidity providers investing in a pool deposit Dai and receive interest bearing DROP tokens in return. On the permissioned RWA Market on Aave investors will be able to provide liquidity for a blended portfolio of DROP tokens. The design of the Tinlake infrastructure is focused on composability and allows for different types of investors to invest in a single pool. Some of our partners we work with are already onboarded to MakerDAO’s MCD. This means individual pools have a corresponding vault on Maker and mint new DAI against their DROP collateral token. With the launch of the Centrifuge market on Aave our asset originators will gain additional liquidity sources and will be able to move their collateral freely between platforms following the best conditions instead of being siloed. To make beginnings easier for our asset originators they will only accept DAI and branch out to other stable coins long term.
Specifications

What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?

The permissioned RWA market will be operated and managed by a Series of END_Bridge LLC, an independent and bankruptcy remote Delaware series limited liability company. Independent means that END_Bridge is not owned, not operated by, and not managed by Centrifuge. END_Bridge stands for being an Early New and Different Bridge to DeFi. LPs will need to go through KYC and sign a subscription agreement with END_Bridge. They get then whitelisted for the permissioned RWA market and will receive aDROP in turn for providing DAI. The main contact on END_Bridge for this proposal will be @thedoctor_j
Centrifuge is the infrastructure provider that enables asset originators to create an on-chain asset fund via Tinlake to finance loans. The asset originators provide the collateral assets to the permissioned RWA market by adding their DROP token to the pool in exchange for DAI.

Tinlake is an open, smart-contract based marketplace of asset pools bringing together Asset Originators and Investors, which seek to utilize the full potential of DeFi. They do this by tokenizing their financial assets into Non-Fungible Tokens (“NFTs”) and use these NFTs as collateral in their Tinlake pool to finance their assets. For every Tinlake pool, investors can invest in two different tokens: TIN and DROP. TIN, known as the “risk token,” takes the risk of defaults first but also receives higher returns. DROP, known as the “yield token,” is protected against defaults by the TIN token and receives stable (but usually lower) returns. This is similar to Junior/Senior investment structures common in traditional finance. Every Asset Originator creates one pool for their assets and issues their own DROP and TIN tokens.

Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?

Both Tradfi and DeFi is undergoing innovation and learning processes. Aave is one of the trailblazers in the community bringing both worlds together. Accepting RWA in a closed environment in the form of a permissioned pool is a first step for Aave towards a wider adoption in traditional finance. The Centrifuge market will be seperated from other Aave markets to guarantuee a safe environment with minimal risks to the protocol. Onboarding real businesses on one side and institutions on the other side will allow the next iteration of DeFi.

Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are the live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?

Centrifuge has been working on enabling businesses to borrow money using their assets in DeFi since the project was founded in 2017. The DApp Tinlake has been in development since early 2018 and is evolving rapidly. We are currently live with Tinlake v3 and host 10 live pools with different RWA collateral types on our network. The biggest challenge has been to bridge the regulated world of Tradfi to the trustless world of DeFi. Creating an infrastructure to securely onboard RWA that is able to scale has been demanding. With our recent onboarding to MakerDAO we deem our initial approach validated and are looking to further expand RWA within DeFi while improving the setup continuously.

Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability

Our smart contracts are controlled by a multisig with 8 signers and 3 signers required per transaction. The contracts are non-upgradeable, based on the MakerDAO coding patterns. DROP tokens are only minted by the Tinlake smart contracts. For the Aave Centrifuge market, a custom adapter will be developed, similar to the existing Maker adapter.

Risk Considerations
Whereas it is a quite common occurrence that highly volatile crypto assets can quickly decrease in value and borrowers get liquidated from one hour to the next, RWA are different. Tinlake pools securitize balanced portfolios of real world assets, making the DROP tokens very stable assets.
Tinlake’s RWA have a maturity date that indicates when a loan needs to be repaid (maturity ranges from 60-90 days for invoices, to 12-24 months for mortgages). If an asset has not been paid back upon maturity an asset originator usually starts a collection process to recoup funds. The worst case scenario is the default of an asset. Asset originators factor in expected defaults into their interest rate calculation and asset specific advance rates (E.g. it is common practice to finance only 80-90% of the face value of an invoice).
Besides accounting for expected default via interest rates, all Tinlake pools have downside protection through the (Junior) TIN tranche. If for instance a single invoice of a balanced invoice portfolio defaults, TIN investors take first loss without impacting the DROP investors. Only if defaults exceed the pool specific TIN ratio the price of the DROP token is compromised. If this happens the pool is frozen which means that the asset originator cannot originate more loans until funds are recouped to pay out DROP investors (see an overview of our revolving pool mechanics here).

Asset parameters
All Tinlake pools have existing risk parameters, most importantly the DROP APR. This is the interest rate that senior (DROP) investors receive on their capital (excluding any cash drag). This parameter reflects the risk of the underlying asset and the senior tranche investment. We propose to use the DROP APR as one of the main drivers to determine the Aave risk parameters while taking maturity, the asset class, the size of the pool and the diversification within the pool into consideration.
In the table below we are proposing the following Aave risk parameters for our current live pools:

We are exploring whether we can use some of the upcoming new features coming in the Aave V2.5 protocol, like the Exposure Ceiling and Borrow/Supply Caps, to ensure proper diversification and risk management in the market.
Every new pool that will be added to the permissioned pool will go through Aave governance and put up for vote.
As for DAI, the currency which investors can use to participate in the market, we plan to only support variable rates in this market. Therefore, we propose the following Borrow Interest Rate for variable borrowing DAI:





DAI Borrow Interest Rate




U_optimal
90.00%


Base
1.00%


Slope 1
3.50%


Slope 2
90%



These are similar to the DAI parameters in the Aave V2 market, with a few exceptions. The optimal utilization rate was set to 90.00% to encourage high utilization of the market, to maximize capital efficiency and investor returns. The slope is slightly lower before the optimal utilization rate, to even out interest rates. Above the optimal utilization rate, the slope is even higher than in the Aave V2 market for DAI, as the optimal utilization rate is higher and thus this will lead to more incentive for repayments when liquidity runs out. The associated interest rate curve has been visualized below.

Technical Specifications
The Centrifuge market will be a new deployment of the Aave V2 protocol, using the permissioned market implementation. We have been working closely with Aave developers and are close to deploying a test version of this market to Kovan. This market differs in a few ways from the existing markets. For regulatory compliance, in order to provide liquidity for the Centrifuge market, investors will need to:

Pass KYC/AML checks.
Sign a Subscription Agreement for the Aave Centrifuge market.

For Tinlake, we have implemented an onboarding UI which facilitates these steps for each specific pool. We plan to re-use this existing UI, which in practice will mean that users will need to go to a webpage like https://tinlake.centrifuge.io/aave/onboarding, where they can follow these steps. Our system will then add these addresses as depositors in the lending pool. After this, they can use the Aave UI to use the Aave Centrifuge market.
Price feed
Each DROP token is linked to a Tinlake pool, which is a set of contracts. There is no secondary market for DROP tokens. The price of the token is based on a NAV (Net Asset Value) calculation, which updates each second. The DROP token price can be calculated from the Assessor contract.
The Aave V2 protocol uses a Chainlink Aggregator by default as a price feed, and can use a fallback oracle if that doesn’t exist. For DAI, we want to use the same oracle setup as DAI on the Aave V2 market. For our DROP tokens, we want to implement a fallback oracle contract, which retrieves the DROP token price from our Assessor contract.
Liquidations
Liquidations can be done by investors who have passed KYC and have signed the Subscription Agreement for specific Tinlake pools. These investors can participate in liquidations to receive DROP at a discount over investing directly into the pool. These DROP tokens can be used to place redemption requests on a specific Tinlake pool.
Each DROP token is already restricted by a memberlist contract. To avoid having to modify the Aave V2 core contracts, we will use a new proxy contract. This contract will be the only address with the liquidator role in the Centrifuge market.

['ARC: Add LINK Liquidity Mining Rewards'],"For the ARC in short
Include aLINK & variableDebtLINK as assets in the IncentivesController contract with the emissionPerSecond rate defined by the consensus of the community.
ARC Rationale
Aave’s liquidity mining program went live last month for lenders and borrowers of DAI, USDC, USDT, GUSD, WBTC, and ETH, resulting in a significant surge of capital being deployed into Aave v2 to receive stkAAVE rewards, decentralizing the AAVE supply and governance powers to the community.
In this ARC, I am proposing that the liquidity mining program be extended to include LINK as an asset eligible for rewards. LINK is the native asset of the decentralized oracle network Chainlink, a protocol that provides Price Feeds that are being used to secure all Aave markets across Ethereum and Polygon.
LINK is one of the most deposited tokens on AAVE with a total of 20.88M LINK ($1.03B) on Aave v2 and 8.14M LINK ($400M) on Aave v1. 7% of the total circulating supply of LINK is deposited onto Aave.
The Aave and Chainlink community are highly synergistic in nature, as Aave is one of Chainlink’s largest users and (imo) its best success story. Much of the LINK community use Aave as their primary solution for borrowing against their LINK stack.
The addition of liquidity mining rewards for LINK deposits would distribute stkAAVE directly to LINK holders, a community that is extremely aligned with the vision of Aave becoming the defacto money market protocol of DeFi. We have supported Aave since day one and I personally believe this program would further strengthen the ties between the two communities.
The liquidity mining rewards could use the same 95%/5% lenders/borrowers distribution as ETH and WBTC. The amount of stkAAVE distributed in each block could be increased to include LM rewards to LINK lenders/borrowers or the existing allocation for LM rewards could be kept the same but lowered for each asset to account for rewards to LINK. The former seems like the more elegant approach, but I am open to either.

Aave is a protocol proudly powered by Chainlink since day one.
This ARC shows a few potential benefits:

Incentivize aLINK migration from V1 to V2
Incentivize a community that already knows the protocol and is known to be active users.
Allows the marines to gain overtime governance power and be more involved in the Aave governance.

['ARC: Add LINK Liquidity Mining Rewards'],"Link marines represent a large portion of usage of this platform and have since its inception.
They are patient, but they are not stupid. If other protocols offer LM rewards (they are), they will eventually leave.
This would occur not only due to a lack of LM rewards but also a poorly crafted stable borrow mechanism that seeks to punish borrowers with exceedingly high borrow rates based on a presumption of “loyalty” without factoring in that alternatives offer considerably better rates. It would be wise to reverse course.
Right now, I see 2 elements (lack of LM and uncompetitive borrow rates) of AAVE incentivizing long time loyal users to leave for other platforms. This proposal removes 1 of those 2 negative elements while adding LM for borrowing hedges the other.
Instead of the data centric question “what is the threshold of borrow rate would be just enough to get them to stay,” - the question should be whether AAVE wants to be a bank that rewards loyalty or a bank that wants to take advantage of loyalty.
I am in favor of the former and this proposal would continue AAVE’s journey back to that path.",107,156.4,2021-05-06

If the $link return was viable enough, there is no reason that the Aave protocol could not retain/acquire enough $link tokens to rival a pool like Linkpoolio $LPL even with a full fledged chainlink staking live.

One thing worth mentioning is that LINK currently is the 8th largest deposit “market size” in AAVE v2, but incredibly low on the borrow side; I believe the lowest deposit/borrow ratio currently in the entire system.
I think a way to spice things up might be incentivizing borrow side only, thus kicking positive feedback loop towards depositors as well.",67,38.4,2021-05-08
['ARC: Add LINK Liquidity Mining Rewards'],"@iDecentralized I agree about quantifying the amount of stkAAVE rewards (ETH is allocated 224.1 stkAAVE per day and WBTC 181.55 per day, so maybe 200 stkAAVE per day for LINK as a middle ground would make sense), but I entirely disagree with just giving rewards to borrowers. What that would do is reward people who short LINK and provide zero stkAAVE LM rewards to the Chainlink community who use their LINK as collateral. ETH and WBTC are also very low on the borrow side when compared to stablecoins, because the vast majority of people are going long on crypto, not short.",66,138.2,2021-05-08
['ARC: Add LINK Liquidity Mining Rewards'],"I think there are other things you can do with borrowed LINK other than shorting, such as using as collateral on other platforms, LPing for yield (Sushi and others even have LM rewards on LINK pair) and with the coming Chainlink 2.0 explicit staking, it could help AAVE be the go-to location for nodes that want to borrow for their Tier 1 backstop.
Depositors in turn will be rewarded due to the borrowing rate increasing, thus increasing yields to depositors.
I am not against allocating to depositors either, as I would be more than happy with the extra juice myself, but I do think it’s interesting to consider all the options!
This is just me speaking off the cuff too, haven’t sat down and thought hard.",63,52.6,2021-05-08
['ARC: Add LINK Liquidity Mining Rewards'],"You could really say the same thing with ETH and WBTC (borrow to then use as an LP, stake in ETH2, etc), but the reason the LM rewards for these tokens are allocated 95%/5% lend/borrow (as compared the stablecoins which are 50%50%) is because people deposit ETH, WBTC, and LINK primarily to use it as collateral in loans. These are the users that should be rewarded, because they provide the most value for the Aave protocol (they borrow stablecoins which gives yield to stablecoin lenders). 95%/5% distribution would still reward borrowers, but prioritize lenders more due to their participation in increasing yield for stablecoin lenders (which incentives more stablecoin deposits, growing TVL).
If only borrowers were rewarded, what would happen is that people would recursively borrow LINK, (deposit LINK as collateral, borrow LINK, redeposit it, repeat), meaning they would be earning zero yield from lending, would provide zero liquidity to Aave in net, and the rewards still wouldn’t be available to those who are using their LINK to borrow stablecoins (the people actually providing economic value to the protocol).

['ARC: Add LINK Liquidity Mining Rewards'],"I’m very much in favor of a 95%/5% lend/borrow split for the reasons ChainLink God described in his most recent post. It just doesn’t seem to make sense any other way at face value when comparing liquidity rewards among the current assets that are rewarded. LINK is clearly not a stablecoin. This is getting overly semantical at this point.
After all, we can always easily make that adjustment down the line, and will have plenty of more actionable data in July when the entirety of the Liquidity Mining proposal is set for renewal/modification (which honestly is all the more reason why this ARC should be expedited for voting asap). The liquidity mining process is only 11 days old right now and the data being a few months old vs. only 11 days old will definitely be way more effective, actionable data to make any useful inferences for changes to allocations of tokens.
For now, using ETH and wBTC as a template is a more than worthwhile assumption for a
95/5% lend/borrow split. Again, LINK is not a stablecoin.
I will also say that the current user votes seem to overwhelmingly agree with wanting to move this ARC along based on other comparable assets and I am also inclined to say that current user votes (over 80%) in the poll seem to therefore overwhelmingly agree with my observations of wanting to expedite this ARC along.",59,56.8,2021-05-08

This has worked for other pairs, so we could adopt it for LINK at this time and modify as needed if it doesn’t play out as expected.

Currently there is no LM rewards for LINK lenders or borrowers or lenders, so I definitely am for raising the number from zero to a higher number. I do personally think that allocation should be seriously considered before implementation and the points I mentioned above still apply (re: deposit vs borrow ratio).
I also agree it’s important to not allow LINK deposits to be siphoned from AAVE and sent to other protocols with better rewards / security / value prop. I just personally don’t see that being the case right now, if anyone has data showing that’s occurring I would love to review!

['From little things big things grow'],"(All figures U.S. Dollars)
Below is a clip (7 mins) showing the maestro @Stani Kulechov orchestrating loans on EthLend, Aave’s predecessor. It is worth a view if only for the CoinMarketCap leaderboard half-way through when prices were a fraction of what they are now and I’ve given the clip a home on the forum here as a reminder of how far Aave and Defi have come in a short space of time.





According to Defi Pulse, total value locked (TVL) in Defi has grown about 1,200% in the last twelve months to around $85 billion, yet this figure is still a fraction of the global financial services market, estimated to be $22 trillion by MakerDao’s recent calculations.
Defi’s current total TVL is just 0.39% of this figure, about a third of one percent.
However, if the same exponential growth rate is maintained for another twelve months, TVL in Defi would reach $1 trillion, making up over 4% of global financial servies market value, a number that would surely cause some serious disruption to traditional finance. Is it possible that we are only a year away?
What do community members think the total TVL in Defi will be in a year from now (just for a little speculative fun). I’m going for the third option which would be a fantastic result :




TVL reaches 125 billion (0.5% of global finance value)
TVL reaches 225 billion (1% of global finance value)
TVL reaches 450 billion (2% of global finance value)
TVL reaches 1 trillion (over 4% of global finance value)

Rationale
Aavegotchi utilizes Aave aTokens in game as collateral assets for Aavegotchis (“playable bank”). Given Aave’s recent launch onto Polygon (where Aavegotchi is deployed) the Aavegotchi community believes it would be a great idea to have GHST token as collateral on Matic Aave. If GHST gets listed as an collateral on Aave, users of Aavegotchi will be able to use aGHST as collateral to play game.

Motivation
Increasing traffic flow, usability and user base for both Aave and Aavegotchi companies.

Specifications


Author of the AIP is a summoner of Aavegotchi.


Aavegotchis are crypto-collectibles (NFT). Aavegotchis are pixelated ghosts living on the Matic blockchain, backed by the ERC-721 standard. Their value is determined by rarity level, which is calculated via multiple factors, such as base traits, amount of staked collateral, and equipped wearables. GHST token is the backbone of Aavegotchi Realm. GHST is an in-game asset, used in all operations in-game (excluding usage of GHST as a collateral for summoning your Aavegotchi, which are aTokens powered by Aave) such as buying portals (opened\closed), wearable items, potions and etc.


Users of Aavegotchi will borrow GHST, to use it as an in-game asset, to speculate on in-game values or for other in-game purposes. Users of Aavegotchi will use it as a collateral to summon their gotchis with it because aTokens are another backbone of the game. To summon your Aavegotchi you need to have a specific amount of aTokens to make it possible.


GHST token has been live on Ethereum Mainnet since September, when it was launched via a continuous bonding curve DAICO sale (still live today at aavegotchi.com/curve). The token was launched at 0.2 DAI / GHST and currently sits at around 1.2 DAI. The all-time high is around 1.9 DAI / GHST. GHST is priced in DAI because unlike most tokens in crypto, it is actually backed by a DAI reserve at a 33% connecting weight. This makes the price more stable because it takes more in/out to change the price.


A significant challenge for Aavegotchi as a project was deciding to migrate our ecosystem from Ethereum to Polygon (then known as Matic). Expensive gas fees would have made it impossible for our players to use Aavegotchi NFTs (which require constant onchain attention). However, from January to March, we were able to complete the migration and launch successfully onto Polygon.

GHST is the official utility token of the Aavegotchi ecosystem and can be used to purchase portals, wearables, and consumables.
The inflation of GHST tokens through purchases on the bonding curve is positively correlated to the GHST price. The bonding curve has been mathematically programmed to increase the price of GHST as the circulating supply of GHST increases.
The bonding curve has minting and burning permissions, but these permissions are governed by the AavegotchiDAO which exists on Ethereum Mainnet. GHST tokens are not arbitrarily minted or burned. The supply is determined by inputs via the bonding curve.

Really love the bonding curve mechanism implemented, especially the impact of token burns.
Whenever GHST is spent in the Aavegotchi ecosystem, 33% of it is automatically sent to a burn address. Unlike most cryptocurrencies, burning GHST (except via the bonding curve) does not actually lower the total value of GHST, since that value is stored as DAI within the bonding curve.
What burning does do is trap DAI within the bonding curve, essentially increasing the reserve ratio over time, which stabilizes the price of GHST.

ARC Rationale
Following API-12, AMPL borrowing & lending went live on the AAVE v2 market 2021-07-24T20:22:00Z.
Since then, there has been a near 100% utilization rate of lent assets. This suggests the maximum cap of the interest rate curve is not able to reach a high enough value to effectively balance incentives between the borrow side and lending side of the marketplace.

While the AMPL spot market is currently in a relatively extreme condition, the Aave borrowing market should be able to perform efficiently in all market scenarios.

ARC in Short
We suggest the following new variable interest rate model:

Optimal utilization = 75%
Slope1 = 2%
Slope2 = 10,000%

This leads to a piecewise linear curve with two parts and three defining points:

Borrow Interest(0) = 0% APY
Borrow Interest(75) = 2% APY
Borrow Interest(100) = 10002 % APY

Since this will result in overall higher fees coming into the system, in tandem we also suggest lowering the reserve factor from 20% to 10% to share more of the revenue with suppliers. This would be submitted as a separate AIP to decouple these decisions.
We believe a nonlinear interest curve is healthiest long-term and could likely be used by many other assets as well, however this work can be discussed more in the future.",90,5408.0,2021-07-26
['ARC: Raise AMPL maximum interest rate'],"fully support this and very much needed. Currently the cap on rates does not do justice for the lenders. We need to find a happy median to incentivize both parties. Having said that, the INSANE demand for ampl is really great to see. Thanks for posting this @brandon",78,120.6,2021-07-26
['ARC: Raise AMPL maximum interest rate'],"Hi Brandon,
I’ve been following this AMPL market closely because of the strange way it is acting. It seems like the economics of this lending market is completely broken because of the AMPL team’s custom implementation of the aToken and corresponding debt token. The implementation does not rebase the debt token, leaving a very enticing opportunity for arbitrage against lenders that deposit AMPL into AAVE. A borrower can simply borrow AMPL, watch their balance grow in a positive rebase, and pay back the unrebased debt pocketing the difference. Note that the borrower does not even have to sell the AMPL to benefit, so it’s not even a short position. The borrower profits simply from the fact that the borrowed asset is actually accounted for as a different asset than the loaned one. As long as the borrower repays before a negative rebase, they are guaranteed a very substantial profit at the expense of lenders.
You suggest 10002% APY as the maximum interest rate. This is equivalent to approximately 465% APR, or about 1.27% per day. The max rebase is ~5%, and so the corresponding interest rate that would compensate for the lenders loss is a 5% daily APY, which is completely unrealistic to implement. This is not to mention the fact that AMPL will simply not be borrowed before negative rebases by rational actors. In order for the lending market to function, the borrowed portion of the asset MUST be treated the same as the unborrowed portion. Otherwise, the math simply doesn’t work out. Nobody will be able to withdraw their AMPL in this current situation until the rebase is predicted to be negative.
In my opinion, the AMPL market should be immediately disabled on the front end and the aToken and debt token implementation revised. In this current situation, arbitrageurs are profiting at unsuspecting lenders expense who believe that they are earning a safe yield. They are not. It is currently impossible for lenders and borrowers to have a mutually beneficial relationship.",78,245.6,2021-07-28
['ARC: Raise AMPL maximum interest rate'],It’s certainly not broken. The rates just need to be tweaked a bit. Actually everything is working quite well. You also may be looking at it in the perspective of someone looking to maximize their percentage of the AMPL network. Whereas new actors may only be in search for a solid steady yield irrespective of which way the market is going. I would say let’s make these modifications and see how it plays out.,70,94.0,2021-07-26
['ARC: Raise AMPL maximum interest rate'],"Dear @pakim249,
Wanted to add some color - maybe helpful for the conversation.
AMPL’s rebase rate and APY actually represent very different things, in my opinion - they should not mirror one another or be otherwise entangled.
Why AAVE will be accelerated by AMPL:
AMPL borrows as a stable unit asset. Thus, the borrower always knows they have a fixed unit of debt + interest.  Since AMPL the asset has proven to be mean reverting in price - the borrower can choose to take on the market time ‘risk’ of waiting for AMPL to return to a price target that is favorable for them.
The lender - on the other hand - is not seeking to get exactly the same yield as if they hold AMPL.
Rather, they seek to lock in the number of units of AMPL they hold on some of their holdings.
So - since AMPL has no “junior” and “senior” tranches - like some assets that seek price stability - all wallet holders are both the junior and senior tranche.  AAVE integration allows these risks to be split:
i) depositors of AMPL maybe keep the numbers of AMPL they have constant, if those AMPL have been lent out.
ii) borrowers of AMPL buy the exposure to changes in supply (by paying interest)
The key unlock for the AAVE platform: in periods when traditional “stables” are in demand (generally market risk-on times), borrowing a stable unit of AMPL may have a lower cost.  Then, the AAVE borrower may sell the borrowed AMPL, use proceeds to buy a risk asset of their choice - and simply take the time to wait for AMPL to be at a price (in the mean reversion) that is favorable for them to close their position.
No risk is created or destroyed - rather it is transformed. And here - it becomes an incredibly powerful asset for both lenders and borrowers on the AAVE platform.
Hopefully this is of help // please let me know if I can improve how I think about these matters.
Also: if anyone finds any of this mind bending - I do as well. Elastic finance is going to be super interesting to build and understand.
And of course worth noting: I hold positions in both AAVE and AMPL.
Warmly
Noah",70,2269.0,2021-07-26
['ARC: Raise AMPL maximum interest rate'],"As a lender, I am quitely agree with the ARC, because when the rebase rate is great larger than the interest rate, lender can withdraw the deposite, to push the uitilization towards 100%, and the interest rate    will be very high for lender. However the defining Borrow Interest(100)  should be mapped with the rebase interest rate to achieve a better game theory between lenders and borrowers",57,91.4,2021-07-27
['ARC: Raise AMPL maximum interest rate'],"What do you mean by the max rebase being 5%?
Also rational actors can profit from borrowing when there’s an upcoming negative rebase. If they where to borrow at the beginning of a period of negative rebases e.g 95c they then could borrow, immediately sell, repurchase at a later date and pay it back at lower price as you would with a regular short position.",56,46.2,2021-07-27
['ARC: Raise AMPL maximum interest rate'],As an AMPL holder I think the AAVE integration creates many opportunities for AAVE as platform itself as well as AMPL holders. I do think that the only reason it hasn’t exploded with more usage is because of the APY cap. Having something closer to Brandon’s solution would provide more utility for both the platform and the holders and users of AMPL imo,58,176.6,2021-07-27
['ARC: Raise AMPL maximum interest rate'],"I want to throw in that maybe there should be a special info button about AMPL and it’s APY on the Dashboard or a special warning for the deposit as new and unsuspecting users are currently completely getting played by people who understand how to game the rebase system against them and they might only look at the APY and not understand why it’s so high. Just to prevent people from calling AAVE a scam platform because they got drawn in by high APY. I think it’s great to have coins like these on the platform as it gives Aave a lot more utility but
it should really be considered that most users, especially those new to crypto don’t know what a rebase Token is and get burned heavily by this",55,176.0,2021-07-27
['ARC: Raise AMPL maximum interest rate'],"Hi @brandon
Thanks for your quick reaction
AMPL had indeed a very specific behavior due to the rebasing which affects borrowers but not suppliers, if the liquidity is borrowed. Borrowers can then game Aave Liquidity Pool given rebasing is more profitable then the borrowing costs; leaving suppliers frustrated as they can’t withdraw their liquidity
It’s key to protect liquidity, to do so the model needs to take into account other market opportunities such as rebasing. I can see the maximum daily rebase is recent, standing at 7% daily
https://www.coin-tools.com/ampl/ampl-rebase-history/
Surprisingly, this is a lot more than the 10,002% APY suggested above as mentioned by @pakim249. Why not make the slope 2 parameters even more aggressive to align max rate and max rebase?
The current liquidity issues are a testimony of the high risk of AMPL which had not been quantified accurately in the initial interest rate parameter calibration. At the moment it’s hard to fully grasp the risks of AMPL for Aave - from my perspective, it is one of the riskiest assets thankfully it cannot be used as collateral. For this reason, I am strongly against reducing the reserve factor which is calibrated based on the risk the asset brings to the Aave DAO",56,231.2,2021-07-28
['ARC: Raise AMPL maximum interest rate'],I agree! Something must change and the interest rate should somehow compensate the rebase rate otherwise I don’t see how this should work in the long run.,54,50.8,2021-07-27
['ARC: Raise AMPL maximum interest rate'],"I think 10,000% APY is still low, that’s not even 1.3% a day. If you see the data from rebases, most positive rebases are way higher than that. Every time AMPL has positive rebase above 1.3% there will be 100% borrow in AMPL pool. Maybe 100,000% APY (around 1.9% per day) or even 1,000,000% APY (around 2.6% per day) should be better for experimentation now, otherwise AMPL is still going to have 100% borrowed when positive rebases happen.
In the medium/long term I would like to see different slopes, depending if AMPL is in a positive, neutral or negative rebase.",54,170.8,2021-07-27
['ARC: Raise AMPL maximum interest rate'],"Interesting comments here. I’ve studied this a bit and it seems like the arbitrage opportunity described by @pakim249 makes it so the interest rate for AMPL will always be naturally super high in the current implementation. Is there a way to counter this long term @brandon ?
On the short term I would support increasing the max interest rate to a very high amount like @Alex_BertoG said to make it fairer for the depositors.
But long-term we need organic borrowers and no one will borrow organically if the rate is at such a high rate. What do we do here?",52,135.4,2021-07-27
['ARC: Raise AMPL maximum interest rate'],"AAVE has an acute need for users who borrow assets. Borrowers are the ones that incur the interest that is paid to depositors (lenders) in AAVE pools. AMPL has strong borrowing demand and it appears the goal of this ARC is to make the depositor and borrower markets more efficient to better serve AAVE users. I support this ARC. I will now outline some of the factors that allowed me to reach this conclusion.
Borrowers drive the platform because many users are willing to lend any asset type. It is a bit more difficult to facilitate demand for borrowing across all asset types. Some assets have strong borrowing demand and some assets do not have strong borrowing demand. This is reflected in pool utilization rates. Some assets have extremely little activity from borrowers and these are typically volatile assets which are easy to identify when looking at the AAVE markets. Many lenders wish to earn interest on these assets but few have a compelling reason to borrow them and as a result APY’s are low and utilization rates are low. Assets with predictable debt obligations such as USDC, DAI and USDT are excellent for the AAVE platform because they generate healthy interest for AAVE users due to solid borrowing demand. These types of assets offer no upside or downside to borrowers but what they do offer to borrowers is a static and predictable debt obligation and that allows AAVE users to borrow those types of assets with confidence.
AMPL is a unique asset in that it offers AAVE users both the complexity of an asset that can offer upside potential while at the same time offering predictable debt obligation to borrowers. All assets that have a predictable debt obligation have grown to very large pool sizes. For example USDC is over 5.5 billion in market size and assets with predictable debt obligation have very healthy demand to borrow. Assets with predictable debt obligations grow large pool sizes and have healthy utilization rates which is ideal for AAVE and it’s users.
Since AMPL has strong borrowing demand the question becomes how do the parameters need to be adjusted? It is abundantly clear based on the consistent 100% utilization rate that borrow interest rates need to be increased dramatically. To what precise limit is very difficult to answer. While it seems that a limit higher than 10002 % APY could make some logical sense, I support the current ARC as described because the most important factor to preserve in any AAVE pool is the demand to borrow which is impacted by the interest borrowers will owe. The ARC as proposed should strike a better balance between APY for depositors and upside potential for borrowers but not cut too deeply into the upside potential of borrowers to harm that side of the market.
What will likely happen as a result of this ARC as proposed: An increase in APY for AMPL lenders will bring in more lenders as the higher APY will be compelling to a larger group of AAVE users. Borrower demand for AMPL will remain strong as AMPL has a predictable debt obligation yet upside for borrowers will dampen as the utilization rate approaches 100% and the 10002 APY limit.
I could see there being adjustments and refinements in these parameters in the future because it is difficult to perfect the limit at this time. It is clear that the ARC as proposed is moving in the direction which is correct, but towards a precision that is difficult to know. What will happen with this ARC is that the AMPL market will come into a better balance which will allow the pool to grow generating a better outcome for pool users.",53,1810.6,2021-07-27
['ARC: Raise AMPL maximum interest rate'],"@pakim249 The arbitrage you describe is not a bug, it’s a feature.
Since the loaned amount does not rebase, lenders transfer their exposure to supply-side risk on to the borrower, this is what allows ampl to safely denominate debt.
To reach an equilibrium, the cost of borrowing ampl during positive rebase needs to be the same as the rebase, arbitrage traders will continue to borrow ampl until this is the case. As it stands, the apy cap prevents market from reaching this equilibrium, which is why the utilization rate is 100% currently.
While I support this proposal, i’m inclined to agree with @DFC, I think apy cap should eventually be far higher, as if ampl were to see a sudden increase in demand, it could easily reach 100% utilization again even with 10,000% apy.",50,275.0,2021-07-27
['ARC: Raise AMPL maximum interest rate'],"I think this ARC should be implented to AIP as soon as possible to protect the stake of lenders, no need to discuss futher details, as least the current ARC can work.",51,150.2,2021-07-28
['ARC: Raise AMPL maximum interest rate'],"Agreed, the current situation is making it difficult for lenders (cannot remove their ampl because of constant 100% usage rate) and also doubly because the incentive to put any more ampl into the pool is low because of the capped APY",54,280.8,2021-07-28
['ARC: Raise AMPL maximum interest rate'],I support the proposed ARC. It’s a good starting point and better than what we have now even if it does not end up being the final solution.,52,80.4,2021-07-28
['ARC: Raise AMPL maximum interest rate'],"I support this ARC. Others point out that 10,000% still doesnt cover larger rebases and I agree, and I think ampl might need custom fee structures that are elastic and scale up and down in the future but this looks like it can really showcase what is possible and also bring great benefits and borrowing volume for Aave.
Would like to raise one point - you state that currently the reserve factor is 20% (hence 38% to lenders but 48% fee to borrow), and aim to lower it to only 10% - however at 10,000% this is 1000% going out to the reserve - is this way too much , does this take away too much value away from the lender? Because as pointed out the 10,000% only scales to cover rebase to around 2.5% (but possibly even less with 10% taken out? Because the apy is so massive couldnt/shouldnt the reserve just be 1% , or 0.5% or less even? Or again this makes me think that ampl might need custom and elastic fees in the future.
Also would like to add a +1 to seeing this go to vote as soon as possible as the issue of the current lenders only earning 1/100th of the rate of ampl holders during the 2 larger rebase days, and the fact that they are locked in because the utilization is at 100% so cant withdraw (which is a bigger issue).
But amazing to see in this first trial and outstanding to see 100% demand. Congrats to both aave and ampl teams, this is pretty historic.",53,285.6,2021-07-28
['ARC: Raise AMPL maximum interest rate'],"I’d like to point out that using APY in this discussion is extremely misleading. 10000% APY is about 465% APR. If 10% of this were to go to reserve, this would be about 46.5% APR or about 51% APY, which is pretty far from 1000%.
Also, raising the interest rate cap is not sufficient justification to lower reserve factor in my opinion, as it remains to be seen whether this cap is actually realized. Also, the ecosystem reserve collects aAMPL, not AMPL. This means that the ecosystem reserve would be subject to the same arbitrage that lenders are subject to and have the same liquidity problems.",51,115.2,2021-07-28

Proposal: Add support for Set Protocol Market including DPI New Market


    Proposal: Add Support for Set Protocol Markets
This is a proposal to add support for a new Set Protocol market that will enable the use of SetTokens as collateral and currency, expanding the surface area of markets that Aave is able to support - a key feature available with Aave 2.0. We imagine the first asset supported by the Set market to be the DeFi Pulse Index (DPI) and others to be subsequently added. 
Set Protocol and Index Coop Summary
Set is an Ethereum-based protocol that enables the wo…
  

What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?
I go by Lemonade Alpha and I am a core contributor for Index Coop.
Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token
DeFi Pulse Index is a basket of 13 popular DeFi tokens available on Ethereum. The methodologist behind DPI is Pulse, Inc, creators of DeFi Pulse. The criteria for token selection can be found here. DPI is the most popular DeFi index product with ~$130m AUM.
DPI is built on top of Set Protocol and managed by Index Coop. Index Coop is a decentralized and autonomous asset manager governed, maintained, and upgraded by INDEX token holders.
Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?
DPI would make an excellent fit for collateral in the Aave ecosystem because it allows for a large pool of dormant capital (>$100m in unincentivized DPI AUM) to find a productive use. Additionally:


Significant Borrow Demand: There is significant desire from whales to lend out the DeFi Pulse index and to use the DPI as collateral to borrow stablecoins for farming, going leveraged long/short, and implementing structured products (e.g. carry trade).


Low Volatility: Because indices are a basket of tokens, they represent less volatility than the component assets by themselves


Efficient Sector Representation: Adding an index as collateral also gives exposure to all the component tokens while only having to add in a single token, thus saving gas in Aave’s system


Liquidity via Primary and Secondary Markets: Minting and redeeming represent the primary market of the indices, but many users can buy and sell indices on the secondary markets - mostly Uniswap. The price on the secondary markets are kept at Net Asset Value (the market value of all the underlying components) through a network of market makers that redeem the tokens when price is below NAV and vice versa.


How is the asset currently used?
Currenlty, DPI is available for collateral in CREAM and can be used to provide liquidity on Uniswap (eligible for INDEX rewards).
Emission schedule
DPI is minted and redeemed by arbitrageurs who are reacting to fluctuations in demand. DPI may also be minted for the purpose of investment and likewise redeemed for the purpose of divestment via an exchange-issue process.

Security Considerations

Smart Contract Risk
Set’s V2 contracts have had upwards of $200M locked and have been live for 6 months.
V2 Smart Contract Audits:


OpenZeppelin  [September 2020]


Counterparty Risk
DPI is the first index product released by Set Protocol and has been functioning securely since its launch in September. Anyone can permissionlessly issue the DPI token by depositing the underlying component tokens and can redeem the DPI token for the underlying components.
Only the Index Cooperative is able to make decisions regarding the index composition and the rebalancing process. Governance over the Index Cooperative is decentralized with the community making critical system decisions.
In the current version of V2, rebalances do not have any lockup times so that does not pose a risk.

Market Risk
DPI is backed by the component ERC20 assets leading to exposure to the market risks of the underlying tokens. Because DPI is a basket of tokens, the volatility of the DPI is significantly less than each individual token as seen in this graph below:

image2258×422 177 KB


Set Market Risk Parameter Considerations
DPI price will be derived from the prices of the underlying components. Rebalancing happens once a month where weights and the underlying assets can change and as a result, oracles must be available for the assets that are added.
The liquidation process can happen in two ways. Liquidators need to liquidate on Aave and then either sell DPI on the Uniswap market or redeem the underlying assets and then sell them.
The Concourse team has an open source version of an arbitrage bot that mints and redeems automatically. It is possible to build a liquidation bot that does the mint/redeem and liquidate function on Aave in 1 transaction.

Proposed Interest Rate Model
We derived the variables of the interest rate model based on the rates DPI’s component assets have on the main Aave market. Slight adjustments were made to reflect the lower volatility of DPI due to it being a basket product and the Set market being a segregated market.

-Liquidation: would Aave be able to promptly liquidate DPI collateral in case of a market crisis when there’s no liquidity on secondary markets?

This is a good question - do you see liquidations as $DPI > ETH or $DPI > Components > ETH?  In my eyes adding that extra step is not necessary but I may be missing something.

The DeFi Pulse Index (DPI) is an index product managed by Index Coop. At the time of writing there are 324,355 DPI in circulation. DPI was audited by OpenZeppelin in September of 2020, launched early October 2020, and has over 111,000 user transactions.

DPI was audited by OpenZeppelin in September of 2020, launched early October 2020, and has over 111,000 user transactions.
DPI Counterparty Risk: C
DPI is a product whereby holders of DPI have no metagovernance influence on Index Coop or the protocol within the index. DPI trades on the ethereum network and inherits the trust of the network much like USDC. DPI has over 12,055 holders and the DPI-ETH pool is Uniswap’s 17th largest at $90M. Anyone can Mint, Trade and Redeem DPI.
The DPI utilises TokenSets V2 smart contract has been audited by Open Zeppelin audit [September 4th, 2020] which identified privilege roles in many of the contracts. The key findings are highlighted below:

The Controller contract has an owner that chooses the contracts that comprise the system. This includes all of the modules, resources and the factories that can be used to make Sets.
The IntegrationRegistry tracks third party integrations that can be used in the system. It also has an owner that can add, remove and edit the integrations as desired.
The PriceOracle has a list of oracles and adapters that can be used to retrieve third party prices. It also has an owner role that can choose the supported oracles, adapters and price pairs.

DPI’s price tracks the Net Asset Value of the underlying assets, by holding a basket of protocol tokens the volatility of a single asset is dampened. This is reflected by DPI having a standard deviation of 5.75% since exception compared to ETH and AAVE which has a standard deviation of 5.03% and 7.79% respectively over the same time period (03/10/2021 to 01/05/2021). When considering liquidity, the average daily trading volume is $7.19M, based on over a trailing 90 day trading period. However, DPI holders have the option to mint/redeem the underlying tokens within DPI which draws on the liquidity of the underlying assets and also allows for any deviation from NAV to be arbitraged away by traders.

"['Proposal: Balancer ""Trinity"" Liquidity Pool Tokens as Collateral']","The Ampleforth community is proposing the addition of the low-volatility AMPL/WETH/BTC “Trinity” pool (1,2,3) as collateral for borrowing on the Aave platform.
The Trinity pool is one of the lowest-risk sources of collateral for lending/borrowing because of the unique elastic “rebase” properties of the Ampleforth protocol; this has historically maintained a near-0.0 correlation with the marketcap of the two current largest crypto-currencies, Ethereum and Bitcoin (7).
Borrowing against Trinity poses a significantly lower liquidation risk than borrowing against any one of the three assets it contains. A user may choose to borrow against the pool if he or she believes that one of the assets may outperform the other two, making the pool ideal for ETH/WBTC swing traders. Many other use cases that require a stable collateral are also possible.
Here, we summarize the assessment of Trinity in the context of the Aave Risk Assessment Framework (4) for the inclusion of a new asset and conclude that the addition of Trinity as collateral will contribute to the strength and resiliency of the Aave protocol.
Smart Contract Risk.
Trinity has been active as a multi-asset balancer pool for just over 100 days (3). Despite the relatively short period of time the pool has been active, we judge the smart contract risk associated with it to be minimal.


The underlying Balancer Labs code has been rigorously audited and battle-tested. Over 1031 transactions utilizing this pool have been executed since origination, an average of about 10 per day.


AMPL has a multi-year track record of successful smart contract developments.


Counter-Party Risk.
Trinity is governed by an autonomous smart contract written by Balancer Labs and deployed by the Ampleforth team. The underlying currencies, Ethereum, WBTC, and Ampleforth, are widely considered to be quality projects, with cautious deployment, deep-dive audits, and sufficient decentralization. Trinity presents no more counter-party risk than using any of the assets individually as collateral.
Of most recent notable mention, the Ampleforth team has taken another important step toward decentralizing the protocol by removing the team’s ability to censor AMPL transactions and pause the rebase function.
Market Risk.
Trinity presents significantly lower market risk than the individual tokens composing it because it is a weighted combination of three assets, one of which, AMPL, exhibits near-0 market capitalization correlation with either of the other two (7).
Trinity currently holds $9.2 million USD in liquidity distributed across 168 owners and has posted an average daily volume of just over $200k USD in the last 30 days(2). 99.8% of the Trinity tokens are locked in the Ampleforth Geyser, where they are earning passive rewards and users are incentivized to provide liquidity for longer periods of time to maximize rewards. The liquidity risk is expected to continue to decline as traders take advantage of the unique three-way arbitrage opportunity presented every 24 hours before and after the Ampleforth rebase (7).
The volatility risk of the Trinity pool was back-tested by computing the expected 24 hour/weekly/monthly price change of the pool as the weighted product sum of the underlying assets using historical data from June 2019 through March 2021 (6). The volatility risk was found to be <1 and decrease with increasing window size for the Trinity pool. The volatility risk at the sampled time windows was lower than that of Ampleforth, Ethereum, and Bitcoin on their own.
Impermanent Loss
The risk of impermanent loss of the Trinity pool is significantly lower than providing liquidity for ETH/AMPL or WBTC/AMPL in a 50:50 ratio (8). The unique arbitrage opportunity offered by rebase is expected to attract significant trading volume to the pool, offering holders an opportunity to earn greater returns on trading fees.
Conclusion
The Trinity Balancer Labs liquidity pool is an optimal source of collateral for borrowing, exhibits low smart contract risk, very low counter-party risk, and minimal market risk compared to borrowing against its constituent assets. The Ampleforth community enthusiastically recommends including this pool as collateral in the Aave protocol.

"['Proposal: Balancer ""Trinity"" Liquidity Pool Tokens as Collateral']","The “Trinity” liquidity pool tokens are interesting because the 3 assets that it consists of are censorship resistant. Bitcoin has the longest operating history and Ethereum has quite a lot as well. No rebasing cryptocurrency has as long of an operating history as AMPL and none ever will. These three assets are first movers and are all censorship resistant primitives.
It’s important to consider correlation and robustness when determining what you might provide as collateral. All three of these assets can not “break” because they are primitives. They are not supported by lenders of last resort. They have no bond schemes or other items to collateralize them. This makes them extremely powerful collateral assets because they can not break.
Correlation is important as the great majority of cryptocurrencies and as a result the majority of LP tokens that will be proposed on AAVE are highly correlated. If they are not then they are likely breakable as all stablecoins are breakable or censorable. In order to achieve the best mix of robustness and correlation the Trinity LP tokens are a solid candidate. Operating history is very important to test out how robust and also how correlated something is. No rebasing asset will ever have the operating history and proven robustness as AMPL because no project can claim the first mover title from AMPL.
All three of these assets: Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ampleforth are first movers. They are unbreakable and not backed by collateral and they make up the most interesting primitives in the cryptocurrency space. I support the addition of the Trinity Pool to AAVE as collateral and feel that the AAVE community would benefit from its inclusion.",39,132.8,2021-03-24

I love both projects and have been a user of both protocols; so I need to speak up fir the higher quality pools that are de-risked with ETH and BTC, it can unlock value both for Uniswap LP providers, And for Aave to help introduce more diversified  collateral to the network. This would increase demand for LP as well as borrowing from the Ampleforth end. This sort of composability is a step in the right direction and a stepping stone for AMPL itself to start unlocking liquidity based on elastic primitives.

['ARC - Add Uniswap V2 DPI-ETH LP to Aave AMM'],"
Summary
We propose listing the Uniswap V2 DPI-ETH LP token as collateral on Aave AMM. Aave would be the first lending protocol to integrate the Uniswap V2 DPI-ETH LP token into its platform.

Motivation
Launched in October 2020 by Index Coop, DPI has grown to over $200M and is currently the most widely traded index product on ethereum. The main liquidity pool for DPI-ETH is on Uniswap V2 with ~$55M of capital deposited into the pool earning ~16.5% per annum in trading fee income.
The DPI-ETH pair is a low volatility pair making the LP token ideal collateral on Aave AMM. DPI-ETH is the 16th largest pool listed Uniswap V2 and is capable of supporting a $184.5K trade for 1% slippage. This is significantly deeper liquidity relative to a number of leading DeFi protocol tokens already listed on Aave AMM.
At the time of writing DPI comprises 20.88% AAVE tokens and the DPI-ETH LP token 10.44% AAVE. Adding DPI-ETH LP tokens as collateral would bring users into the Aave AMM ecosystem allowing capital, yield and value to accrue to Aave participants.

Specification
Details on DPI the asset can be found on the ARC: Add support for DeFi Pulse Index (DPI) forum post. DPI-ETH has a Chainlink oracle. DPI-ETH LP token price data can be obtained from etherscan.
DPI-ETH Chainlink Oracle: Ethereum Price Feeds | Chainlink Documentation
Currently, Index Coop offers liquidity mining rewards for depositing the DPI-ETH LP token into a staking contract via the Index Coop website. Liquidity mining rewards are currently 12.4% at the time of writing in addition to ~16.5% trading fee income.
As DPI-ETH has no governance voting power and the emission schedule of the LP token is determined by users depositing into the Uniswap V2 liquidity pool. Currently, Aave AMM will be the first lending protocol to accept DPI-ETH LP token as collateral. There is no multisig controlling the trustless Uniswap V2 pool.

Technical Specification
DPI-ETH LP token - Aave Risk Assessment

Screenshot 2021-06-01 at 20.40.511460×268 14.7 KB

The Uniswap V2 DPI-ETH pool has a 7-day average trading volume of $10.9M, ~$55M of liquidity and the pool was seeded 6th October 2020, 262 days prior to 1st June 2021.
There are over 900 unique holders of 23,324 DPI-ETH LP units, of which ~700 unique holders have deposited ~94.4% of the circulating supply into Index Coop’s staking contract. Etherscan shows 36,637 transfers of the DPI-ETH LP token.
DPI the asset has an overall risk score of B and Uniswap V2 DPI-ETH LP has marginally better risk score of B+. Referring to AMM-Market documentation, this assessment is aligned with AAVE, UNI, MKR, SNX and YFI which all experienced improving risk scores on AMM relative to Aave V2.
Using equations cited below, the following volatility statistics have been calculated for the LP tokens USD value.
DPI-ETH LP 7 days volatility = 0.0712
DPI-ETH LP 30 days volatility = 0.0558
DPI-ETH LP 90 days volatility = 0.0644
DPI-ETH LP 180 days volatility = 0.0632
Risk Parameters

Screenshot 2021-06-01 at 20.41.461440×200 9.73 KB

The risk parameters mentioned above are in line with other LP tokens like Uniswap and Maker. Aave documentation states the Liquidation Bonus is set at 15% for all LP tokens. The LTV & Liquidation Threshold parameters are derived from DPI’s risk assessment.

Introduction
Does Dogecoin even need an introduction? Of course not, if you want to stay up to date about Doge, simply follow Elon Musk on Twitter.
But what has come to folks attention is that there in fact is a wrapped Dogecoin on Ethereum now, which actually launched very recently! And given the popularity, market cap, and trading volume of Dogecoin on centralized exchanges, the question is whether to bring this over into DeFi instead. Even Stani asked this question:

The community is divided: while some thing Doge is the standard, others bark at silly and crazy it is. However, whatever emotional feelings you have towards Doge, I think we should consider honestly whether adding it to Aave is beneficial for the protocol and the community, in terms of TVL, volume, growth, and security.

How is it wrapped
Just like renBTC, renDOGE is a 1:1 representation of Dogecoin, that can be minted and redeemed 24/7 completely permissionlessly through the RenVM network, currently through OpenDAO, or YF Link, and it will be available soon on the next revamped version of our in-house RenBridge.
RenVM is a byzantine fault-tolerant network that is able to securely in a decentralized manner do ECDSA threshold key generation and signing via sMPC, which allows RenVM to securely manage (ECDSA) private keys of different assets like Bitcoin, Zcash, and now Dogecoin, and wrap these assets on smart-contract chains like Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. Since launch, RenVM has processed around $2B in total volume of Bitcoin, Zcash, Bitcoin cash, and Filecoin, going to and from Ethereum.
While the security of RenVM is controlled by the Ren team for now, we are very shortly beginning to decentralize this part, which you can read about here:

renDOGE liquidity
While renDOGE became possible to mint last week (26th January), we already have over 60m DOGE minted, which at the time of writing is about $2.3m. This has been fantastic growth, with liquidity pools and their volumes on Uniswap and LinkSwap matching that.

['Proposal: Add renDOGE'],"I’m highly in favor of this ARC as you might’ve guessed from the quote above. The way I view RenVM’s bridge is that it will over time continue to 1) unlock cross-chain liquidity but also and, more importantly, 2) activate additional communities/users to use their investments. RenVM will enable crypto-fans and hodlers from all over the crypto world to use their investments in DeFi on any major chain (first on Ethereum, and hopefully, first on Aave). Aave could be the first major platform to usher in a new set of users, our Doge friends, into the DeFi space.
Hopefully my point comes across about the potential at hand here. As a community member, I’d love to strike while the iron is hot and while users are riding the DOGE train. This is our opportunity to welcome Doge holders to Ethereum. Let’s grab the chance while it is here.

Summary
The StraitsX team would like to submit the following proposal to add XSGD support by Aave.
XSGD is the first and only fully collateralised Singapore Dollar stablecoin, powered by open-source blockchain protocols. All XSGD tokens have 1:1 parity and convertibility with the Singapore Dollar.

XSGD Background
XSGD is the first stablecoin initiative focusing on Southeast Asia. Today, most stablecoins in circulation are pegged to the U.S. Dollar. The StraitsX team believes that this current state is not representative of users’ ultimate preferences, but rather the consequence of a lack of trusted and compliant alternatives denominated in other native fiat currencies. The XSGD token was designed by the StraitsX team for utmost efficiency and simplicity to empower both individuals and institutions in Southeast Asia.
Launched in October 2020, XSGD is backed 1:1 with the Singapore Dollar (SGD) and issued by Xfers, a Southeast Asia based payments leader holding a Major Payment Institution (MPI) license for e-money issuance under the Payment Services Act (PS Act) from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).
About Xfers
Founded in 2015, Singapore-based FinTech Xfers aims to accelerate financial access within Southeast Asia by enabling businesses to accept payments and send money seamlessly. Xfers is backed by Y-Combinator, Quest Ventures, Golden Gate Ventures and is a member of Fazz Financial Group
About StraitsX
StraitsX is the pioneering payments infrastructure for digital assets space in Southeast Asia developed by Xfers. StraitsX offers personal and business accounts to deposit, hold and withdraw funds through wire transfers and the Singapore Dollar-backed stablecoin, XSGD. Business accounts can also access B2B API-enabled payments rails enabling instantaneous settlement for funds collection and disbursements.
StraitsX currently provides the Singapore Dollar payment infrastructure for 18 digital assets platforms including Binance Singapore, Gemini, Crypto.com, Liquid Exchange, Zipmex, CEX.IO, Indodax among many others.
E-money Characteristics
According to the PS Act, e-money is defined as any electronically stored monetary value that is denominated in any national currency, for which a corresponding amount of fiat currency is stored in reserve with a Full Bank and which represents a claim on the issuer. As a digital representation of the single fiat currency, e-money encompasses the monetary value of the fiat currency, i.e. having a fixed exchange rate to the given fiat currency.
Under its MPI license for e-money issuance activity, Xfers can mint unlimited numbers of XSGD tokens while ensuring the corresponding fiat fund is safeguarded in segregated accounts with a fully regulated MAS-approved bank undertaking full liability for the safeguarded relevant monies. Each XSGD token is fully collateralized one-for-one by the Singapore Dollar (SGD).
Reserve Management
While all stablecoins aim for price stability, the mechanisms by which they achieve such stability are not necessarily created equal. XSGD’s stability stems from a strong combination of StraitsX holding fiat money in its reserve for an amount equivalent to the number of tokens in circulation, one-for-one convertibility, availability, short settlement time, daily internal reconciliations, as well as a solid compliance infrastructure that operate together to create a digital token that represents one Singapore Dollar.
Minting XSGD can be done directly through the StraitsX platform. Users will be required to first top up their Xfers Account with Singapore Dollar (SGD). Once funds are available in the account, a user may initiate a withdrawal for the desired amount of XSGD tokens. Minting and transfers through this channel will be processed every business day by the StraitsX team thus ensuring T+1 settlement.
Supported Blockchains
XSGD is available on both Ethereum (as an ERC-20 Token) and Zilliqa (as a ZRC-2 Token) blockchain protocols. It is currently the largest stablecoin by market capitalization issued from Asia Pacific.
XSGD Ecosystem
As of May 2021, XSGD is strategically supported by a versatile ecosystem of 18 digital asset platforms ranging from non-custodial wallets to institutional custody solutions, exchanges, DeFi platforms, and Blockchain analytics tools. For a complete list of StraitsX partners, please visit https://www.xfers.com/sg/straitsx.
Decentralised Exchanges include Uniswap, DFX Finance and Zilswap. Centralised Exchanges include  Liquid Exchange, Crypto.com, Indodax, Tokenize Exchange, CEX.IO, Xanpool, Coinut with the potential for many more to come in the future.
StraitsX Team
As of May 2021 The StraitsX team comprises 40 team members while Xfers is 150+ strong.
The spokesperson for StraitsX is Aymeric Salley, Head of StraitsX. Prior to Xfers, Aymeric was leading Digital Assets initiatives at Paxos, and in Financial Services at PwC.
The author of the AIP will be the Head of StraitsX Engineering, Jun Hao Yap.
XSGD Market Data
XSGD is listed on CoinMarketCap, Coingecko and Coinpaprika among other analytic platforms.
As of 28 May 2021, XSGD has been transacted over 76,000 times, amounting to 676M USD, with over 4600 active addresses. XSGD’s Market Capitalisation stands at 33.5M USD.
Visit xfers.com/sg/straitsx for the latest information on market data.
Risk Analysis
The StraitsX Team applied Aave’s Risk Framework to XSGD leading to an overall risk rating of C.

Screenshot 2021-05-29 at 12.35.45 AM1202×94 14.6 KB

XSGD Smart Contract Risk: C
The first XSGD Smart Contract was deployed on Github on 12 March 2020. Since its inception, XSGD has recorded over 76,000 transactions on-chain.
XSGD Counterparty Risk: C
XSGD has an estimated 4600 holders and it is a centralised and regulated stablecoin.
Each XSGD token is backed by one Singapore Dollar that is being held and safeguarded in segregated accounts with a licensed financial institution.
Market Capitalization: C
XSGD is the largest Stablecoin by Market Capitalization in Asia Pacific. The Digital Asset landscape is growing at an exponential rate in the region and we believe that getting on Aave would be the catalyst to accelerate this growth.
Average Volume 1M: C-
XSGD users are currently concentrated in Singapore. StraitsX is working closely with partners globally to expand support for XSGD. XSGD is currently listed on regional exchanges like Indodax and CEX.IO. With more partners supporting XSGD, StraitsX believes that XSGD is a viable alternative to USD stablecoins, leveraging on the strength and stability of the Singapore Dollar.

XSGD has maintained its peg to the Singapore Dollar with great consistency, hence exhibits low normalised volatility.
Benefits for Aave

With most active stablecoins currently denominated in USD, StraitsX believes that this state is not representative of users’ ultimate preferences but rather due to a lack of trusted and compliant alternatives denominated in other fiat currencies. With Singapore ranked consistently as one of the world’s easiest places to do business by the World Bank, StraitsX believes that there is a desire for businesses in Asia and beyond to transact in a Singapore Dollar denominated stablecoin.
XSGD will be the largest Asia Pacific issued fiat-backed stablecoin on the Aave protocol.
XSGD presents an opportunity for users to hedge the Singapore Dollar against other assets.

['Proposal: Add Support for Centrifuge Real-World Asset Money Market'],"Aave 2.0 comes with many new features and there’s one we’re particularly excited about: creating new money markets. This opens up a whole new avenue of accommodating real world use cases for the wider DeFi ecosystem.
We’re proposing to add a real world asset (RWA) money market to the Aave protocol allowing investors to gain exposure to a portfolio of different crypto-uncorrelated asset types.
Motivation:
Centrifuge has been building the necessary technology for adding RWA to DeFi and with the arrival of Aave V2 it’s now possible to connect these two building blocks. These assets bring stability to the highly volatile market, diversify risk and are the avenue to move DeFi beyond its niche status. Aave is pioneering on-chain lending, starting with flash loans and expanding to credit delegation. Extending decentralized lines of credit to existing businesses seems the natural next step on its path to pose a real alternative to traditional financial products.
Centrifuge has helped Asset Originators such as ConsolFreight, Paperchain, Harbor Trade Credit and NewSilver to tokenize real world assets and facilitated since its launch in May financing of over DAI 2.4M. These Asset Originators jointly have capital needs of well over DAI 50M and bring a diverse set of crypto-uncorrelated assets to Aave.
A brief overview of how Centrifuge works:
Centrifuge is building a full stack of tools to bring RWA into DeFi. Assets such as freight invoices, warehouse receipts or even real estate can be tokenized in the form of an NFT. Each NFT represents one unique real-world asset with a unique default risk that is priced by an off-chain oracle. Centrifuge Tinlake is a set of smart contracts that handles the bundling of these individual loans and issues interest bearing ERC20 tokens against the pool. Pooling these assets allows the Asset Originator to offer a more stable return (and diversified risk) and offers a tradable, fungible token to the lenders.
Tinlake has two different ERC20 tokens that lenders can buy: TIN and DROP. The TIN token is the junior tranche that takes any first losses and is primarily bought by the Asset Originator and other lenders that seek leveraged exposure to the portfolio. Tinlake is configured to require a minimum amount of investment in the TIN token. Any losses that occur in a portfolio will first be covered by TIN token holders. More information on how the two tranches work can be found here.
1000×564 78 KB
Centrifuge is partnering with many Asset Originators. Four are already live today and new ones will go live every month. Each Asset Originator deploys an individual Tinlake pool, hence issuing its individual TIN and DROP token.
Creating an Aave Money Market for Real World Assets:
Aave’s support for multiple markets makes it easy for the Aave community to start onboarding these assets into the protocol and allow investors to opt into lending against these assets: Aave users can provide liquidity to the market by depositing DAI and earn interest from a balanced collateral portfolio of different RWAs. The Centrifuge Real World Asset Market will be managed by AAVE token holders through the same governance processes as with the existing markets live today. They set the different risk parameters and onboard these pools as they see fit.
How are Centrifuge Assets Liquidated:
RWA are not as liquid as crypto native assets but they are much more stable. This stability means liquidations are a rare occurrence. These assets are not traded on liquid exchanges and instead the default way to liquidate them is to redeem them for DAI: In order to allow users to recover their funds in case of a default Centrifuge has built the Tinlake contracts to manage the liquidation of loan portfolios on-chain. This mechanism entails letting the portfolio of a compromised pool either mature (in case of short term assets with a maturity of less than 90 days, e.g. invoices) or refinancing them off-chain and using loan repayment to settle the debt balance. Repayments are directly disbursed to the Aave market making them available to Aave users immediately.
When a price feed reports bad performance to the Aave market and the minimum portfolio value of the pool is not met anymore a custom liquidation mechanism for Centrifuge Tinlake pools gets triggered. It immediately posts a redeem order for the entire collateral to the pool. This will automatically redirect any cash flows coming in from borrowers to DROP investors. They will receive any money that is repaid on the existing portfolio as it gets repaid.
This post is intended to give a first introduction to the concept of a Real World Asset Money Market on Aave. We’re looking forward to community feedback and happy to join one of the next Aave community calls to walk through the proposal.

My first question is with regards to the Asset Originators and how they benefit from the Tinlake platform. As I see here, the Asset Originators are financing companies themselves. As you said, they’re the main investors in TIN tokens. So, the incentive behind offering TIN and DROP tokens to outside investors, for them, is to source additional capital and be able to scale beyond what their balance sheet allows. Is that right? I’m also guessing that those companies have a harder time sourcing capital from the traditional finance world?


With regards to Aave more concretely, is the idea to open new TIN and DROP markets that would work in a similar way in which crypto markets currently work in Aave? For example, a TIN or DROP investor that wanted liquidity would deposit their tokens in Aave and be able to get a USDC loan. Am I getting it right?

['Proposal: Add Support for Centrifuge Real-World Asset Money Market'],"Hi @JonathanErlich hanks for the feedback. Let me try to answer your two questions:
(1) How are Asset Originators benefiting from Tinlake? As you said correctly, all AO are financing companies. For instance ConsolFreight finances freight forwarding invoices and trade finance transactions allowing the involved companies to receive payments instantly instead of having to wait 60-90 days for their money. The money they pay out to their borrowers comes from different liquidity sources (that could be a bank credit line, non-bank lenders, etc). Tinlake connects them to the DeFi ecosystem and allows them to source additional liquidity through (1) individual investors and (2) decentralized lending protocols such as Aave and Maker that they can tap into. On top of that, Tinlake is a revolving pool. That means that an AO can continuously originate and add new assets to a Tinlake pool and can continuously allow new investors to deposit funds that they can draw from according to their capital needs. Interest is only generated when the capital is deployed. This gives AO much more flexibility in managing their capital sources. The majority of the AO we partner with do have traditional funding sources (e.g. New Silver that finances real-estate backed loans has a private fund credit line with a credit limit of $20m) but  they do see the  potential of DeFi as a competitor to those traditional sources with better and more transparent rates.
(2) For a RWA Money Market on Aave we propose to use only DROP for now (as DROP is first loss protected by TIN; DROP representing the senior tranche and TIN representing the junior tranche). Aave users can deposit stablecoins (we will start with DAI and open it up to e.g. USDC eventually) into the RWA MM and several AO would be eligible to draw from these funds in return for locking in their DROP. The risk parameters that allow the AO to access the MM would be determined together with the Aave community.
Let me know if this was helpful or if something remains unclear.",110,72.0,2020-10-08

The Tinlake workaround built by Centrifuge is great, because:
A. It takes non-fungible financial assets (unique receipts) and makes them “fungible” (see here)
B. Tinlake financial assets are split in two: DROP (safer) and TIN (riskier)

Proposal: Dynamic Risk Parameters

Summary
A proposal for continuous market risk management to optimize yield, capital efficiency, and mitigate depositor losses.

Background
Across DeFi protocols, some things never change. Depositors want risk-adjusted yield, borrowers want capital efficiency, traders want lower fees, liquidity providers want to avoid impermanent loss, and the list goes on. Everything else changes from the participant behavior to the market microstructure. These are market risks.
Aave’s Risk Framework shows the importance this community puts towards understanding and mitigating risk. Over the past year, Gauntlet deployed our simulation platform to model Aave V1, V2, and the Safety Module under extreme market conditions. We were happy to report the protocol structure is broadly sound and made risk parameter recommendations to further reduce insolvency risk.
Preventing insolvency is not the only market risk Aave faces. Deflationary spirals and shocks to market prices can’t simply be prevented without reducing the protocol’s utility. Tail-event scenarios are rarely the result of bad actors taking malicious actions against the protocol. The vast majority of Aave’s participants are honest but what’s good for the lender is not always good for the borrower. Depositors lend, borrowers borrow, and liquidators rebalance. This intersection is where Gauntlet comfortably sits, directing traffic per the stated desires of the community.
Gauntlet continues to rerun our simulations since publishing the Market Risk Assessment. What we observe is regular changes in the optimal risk parameters, which raise several questions. Is the market risk framework only needed at asset onboarding? Is the existing framework good enough? Or does it block the next wave of protocol growth? Do changes in volatility and liquidity risk need to be accounted for as TVL grows?

Proposal
In the following sections, we will outline the case and goals for dynamic risk parameters. The initial proposed scope will be small to control for the target metrics Gauntlet aims to improve. Those metrics are:

Risk-adjusted yield for Depositors
Capital efficiency for Borrowers
Mitigate Depositor losses

Gauntlet will improve the metrics above without increasing the net insolvent value percentage or the slashing run percentage. See section 5.3 of our Market Risk Assessment for more details.
Illustrated in the examples below are the benefits from our parametrizations made during the V1 to V2 migration. Additionally, we dive into the adverse effects that recent market conditions have had on parameter recommendations yet to be changed.

Increasing Depositor yield - $230M USD or 1.5% increase in annualized lender income
From parameter suggestions made in November 2020, Aave V2 safely increased borrow risk parameters for multiple assets from the V1 to V2 protocol. For example, increasing Loan-to-Value (LTV) and Liquidation Threshold for collateral assets like ETH, WBTC, USDC, and LINK afforded borrowers better health factors and increased demand.
The largest weekly average TVL (February 17-23) for Aave V1 was $3.0B. In that week, accrued interest was approximately $1.2M—for an annualized yield of 2.08% across all depositors.
For Aave V2, the largest weekly average TVL (May 10-17) has been approximately $12.7B. This week alone generated $8.6M or a 3.52% annualized yield. Conservative estimations that control for liquidity mining incentives still return a 2.5% annualized yield.

Risk Parameters






Improving Borrower Capital Efficiency -  Average WBTC, LINK, ETH collateralization ratios reduced between 34-50%
Data from user behavior from Aave V1 (from February 17th, 2021) to Aave V2 (from April 27th, 2021) reveals significantly more aggressive collateralization ratios. The same adjustments to risk parameters that increase depositor yield allow borrowers to improve the capital efficiency of their positions. We do not assume that risk parameter changes exclusively drove increased borrow behavior. That said, attributing a small portion to improved health factors backed by stress tests via simulation is justifiable.
From V1 to V2, the average user utilizing WBTC as collateral saw a health factor reduction from 4.00 to 2.57 (36%). For LINK from 6.31 to 4.16 (34%) and ETH/WETH by 8.10 to 4.03 (50%).
Maximizing borrow behavior without sacrificing protocol safety is an essential optimization for protocol resiliency and against liquidation cascades.

Mitigating Depositor Losses - $4M USD (1.3%) of total liquidation value between May 17-23, 2021
Detailed at length in our report (see Sections 6.3, namely 6.3.1 on page 22-23) is the risk of high liquidation bonus values. If the lowered liquidation bonus values suggested were implemented, Aave would have mitigated depositor losses while maintaining a low risk of insolvency. For example, our March liquidation bonus recommendations would have mitigated $4M of losses for 590 distinct users from May 17-23.

Expectations


Risk Parameter Updates

Exclusively for Aave V2 assets
Supported Risk Parameters: Loan-To-Value, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus
Market conditions will determine the frequency of updates. For that reason, no SLA will be preset.
A Risk DAO may make the most sense to provide oversight and management of all risks associated with Aave. Gauntlet would be complementary to the Risk DAO to coordinate parameter changes. Gauntlet will proceed with the manual ARC to AIP process unless circumstances change.



Communications

Risk parameter changes will follow the standards suggested for the Aave Snapshot Space.
Quarterly, Gauntlet will post a Snapshot vote to determine the preferred risk tolerance of the community. The outcome of this vote will determine the risk and capital efficiency tradeoffs Gauntlet will target.
Monthly forum posts and participation on community calls with explanations of risk parameter changes and any anomalies observed.
Risk Dashboard (refer to the next section)
Quarterly Risk Reviews will provide a detailed retrospective on market risk.



Out of Scope

Aave V1, AMM, and Polygon Markets
In line with keeping the scope small, Gauntlet will not look to manage the following at the outset:

Enabling or disabling a currency for borrowing
Setting interest rate strategies
Configuring the caps (borrow caps, supply caps, exposure ceiling)
Configuring Reserve Factors


An implementation using the soon to be merged riskAdmin role.

Should this experiment be a success, we would seek whitelisting to make updates with more precision.






Risk Dashboard
As part of this engagement, Gauntlet will build a Risk Dashboard and API for the community to provide key insights into risk and capital efficiency.





Please note, all numbers are for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect the current or possible future state of Aave V2.
The dashboard focuses on both the system-level risk in Aave V2 and the market risk on an individual collateral level. Our goal is to help convey our methodology to the community and provide visibility into why we are making specific parameter recommendations.
The dashboard will monitor all collateral assets in Aave V2. The two key metrics are Value at Risk (VaR) and Borrow Usage.
Value at Risk conveys capital at risk due to insolvencies and liquidations when markets are under duress (i.e., Black Thursday). The current VaR in the system breaks down by collateral type. We currently compute VaR (based on a measure of protocol insolvency) at the 95th percentile of our simulation runs assuming peak volatility in the past year. We do this using Aave’s current parameters as well as after modifying the parameters to the Gauntlet Recommendations.
Borrow Usage provides information about how aggressively depositors of collateral borrow against their supply. Borrow usage is a measure of capital efficiency and builds on past work for Aave. Defined on a per Asset level as:

where U is the utilization ratio of each user:

We aggregate this to a system level by taking a weighted sum of all the assets used as collateral.
To show Gauntlet’s impact, we measure these using the current system parameters and expected results (based on our simulations) if Aave were to implement the parameter recommendations suggested.

Cost
Gauntlet charges a service fee that seeks to be commensurate with the value we add to protocols. In Aave’s case, despite various exogenous factors, Gauntlet can be more confident in the expected impact of our proposal given our prior recommendations to the Aave Genesis team. Gauntlet also wants to provide a strong signal of our alignment with the protocol. For that reason, we propose a service fee denominated in stkAAVE with an additional linear vesting period of 6 months for half (½) of each quarterly payment. Multiple comments suggested a similar vesting structure in the liquidity incentives proposal thread. In addition, Gauntlet will deploy the OpenZeppelin Token Vesting contract to provide the community a revocable option should our impact or engagement be deemed unsatisfactory. At the start of every quarter for one year Gauntlet will request service fee payment via AIP.
The formula to calculate Gauntlet’s service fee has four components:

An asset multiplier to track risk management complexity
A proxy for capital efficiency
A base fee
Aave price

The asset multiplier calculation is log(Number of Assets, 10)*. New assets on the protocol add complexity to risk management. While the market risk optimization problem does not grow linearly, consideration should be taken when onboarding assets. For example, xSUSHI has no real market data, and modeling requires taking staking yield into consideration.
The most straightforward proxy for capital efficiency is the total borrowed** for risk-managed assets—only V2 assets initially. Capital efficiency is realized by borrowing demand.
Gauntlet’s risk management base fee is 10 basis points annually, derived from a conservative estimation of the impact from dynamic risk parameters. See examples above.
The USD price of AAVE. Whether the price should be fixed or calculated quarterly, different communities have different opinions on how this aligns incentives. We will defer to the preference of the community but will default to calculating quarterly.
Gauntlet quarterly service fee = log(Number of Assets,10) * Total $ Borrow * 2.5 basis points / AAVE price (tables below calculated at $312)

Gauntlet quarterly service fee denominated in AAVE

Growth and drawdown examples

*Log value is the minimum of the tier range except in the “<= 10” column, where it is 10. For example Column “21-25” returns log(21,10)
** Rounded down to the nearest $1B
*** When Total Borrow < $3b, there is no basis point fee. The formula is log(Number of Assets,10) * $1,200,000 / 4 )

I see their work as highly complementary to the current efforts going towards establishing Aave’s RiskDAO and a consistent risk framework.
As asset complexity increases - e.g., assets with unique behavior like AMPL, productive assets like xSUSHI, assets building off other assets, etc. - it’s increasingly important to have community partners that can adapt / digest that complexity and translate it into trade-offs to support community decisions.
Beyond our high-level, enthusiastic support for this proposal, I wanted to also point out the alignment in the cost structure. Had some early feedback to the Gauntlet team on this and I think this version is strongly aligned and includes the right levers to drive Aave’s growth responsibly.
Hopefully the community doesn’t skim over this because it’s great. TradFi is used to seeing advisors / service providers that take a broad % of AUM or volume without much thought re: asset mix or actual effort required. The formula Gauntlet proposes here takes into account:

number of assets (how hard the work getting)
total borrow demand (how the work supports growth / usage)
base fee (keeping the lights on / increase alignment)

Those levers make a lot of sense and work really well to align the success of this initiative with the cost. With that said, certainly agree with @Alok_StandardCrypto on the periodic review, especially as the RiskDAO starts taking a clearer shape / role.

['Proposal: Dynamic Risk Parameters'],"This is Ratan, President of Blockchain @ Berkeley.
We believe that Gauntlet has proven itself to be one of the leaders within the DeFi space, and we see incredible value to the Aave community in implementing dynamic/continuous market risk management to enable the protocol to be more effective for Aave users. With the exponential increase in the usage of Aave since v2 began, we believe that having Gauntlet complement the proposed Risk DAO for parameter updates enables both a more balanced and incentive-aligned system for parameter updates. Additionally, we believe that this partnership provides a clear model for collaboration on future initiatives between the Aave ecosystem and DeFi platforms.
Furthermore, we believe that the OpenZeppelin Token Vesting contracts provide a clear methodology by which the Aave community can decide whether or not to continue the program based off of their satisfaction with Gauntlet’s execution.
We really appreciate Gauntlet’s transparency in their reasoning and calculations behind the service fees taken for running the service - and this should be the standard moving forward - as it provides the community with a clear understanding of the sizing of the fee. However, we believe that this proposal would benefit from additional transparency on the Gauntlet side for how these funds will be used (i.e. estimations on Gauntlet team/infrastructure costs, etc.) - as more transparency on DeFi initiatives such as these is always better than less.
As a side note - we also are strong proponents of open developer resources to the DeFi community such as the Risk Dashboard & API and are excited to see this included!
Overall, we’re in strong support of this proposal and are excited to help contribute to shape it alongside the Aave community. Thanks @inkyamze and the rest of the Gauntlet team in putting this together!",79,105.8,2021-07-17
['Proposal: Dynamic Risk Parameters'],"Welcome to the community @ratankaliani and thanks for the kind words! As you mentioned and we hope the proposal indicates, we have a strong inclination towards transparency and building tools for the community.
We are a team of 21 and are actively hiring to better fulfill the needs of engagements like the one proposed above. Of course, Gauntlet would not direct all of our engineering/data science/product/program management resources towards a single engagement. That said, our model and simulation work on other protocols, not just liquidity protocols, result in better assumptions and risk management for individual protocols like Aave.
Inputs have costs. Some of these costs have been partially accounted for from our prior engagement writing the Market Risk Assessment. For example, ETLs, Aave V1/V2 contracts integrated into our simulation SDK, baseline QA processes, and some Kubeflow automation.
Outputs provide value. As mentioned, Gauntlet seeks to charge commensurate to the value provided. Our goal is to drive down costs while increasing the value added to Aave. The better we do this the better we can service the protocol. Fortunately, we are well capitalized and can focus on delivering value over driving down costs. The Risk Dashboard and API are a good example of value bets we would like to take that have a large costs (development, automation, maintenance).
As a reviewer on the Aave Grants DAO, I heavily weight towards the value a grant application will provide to the community over the cost. If we fail to do so it will be even tougher to attract top talent to tinker, build, and iterate on the protocol. There are various RFPs and significant resources that are already difficult to fulfill and deploy.
We hope our value provided resonates with the community.",76,90.2,2021-07-17
['Proposal: Dynamic Risk Parameters'],"Hi there,
Conceptually, I like very much the idea of having dynamic risk parameters, it makes sense to automatise and  sytematise anything that can be.
What would be the implication for borrowers though - would they be expected to constantly monitor and adjust their leverage to make sure they don’t get liquidated in case of a change in Liquidation Threshold?
As both a borrower and a AAVE holder, I don’t think that would be attractive at all. The way around that would consist in applying the latest dynamically adjusted parameters to new loans only (e.g. At time T when Liquidation Threshold was 80% I made a loan using ETH as collateral; At time T+1 risk parameters get updated and Liquidation Threshold  for ETH drop to 75%, my LTV is 79% but I am still good because this is below the Liquidation Threshold at the time I made the loan).
Is that how you were thinking of implementing it and how it has been accounted for in your analysis?",68,78.6,2021-07-26
['Proposal: Dynamic Risk Parameters'],"Fantastic proposal at an extortionate price. How to justify spending $8m/year on an external centralised software that is not fully understood, validated? Based on the current ARC, no one would even be working full-time for the Aave Protocol right?
The scope is extremely limited to just some of the risk parameters - what about other risk parameters and other risks? The budget should start small and expand with Gauntlet’s risk management mandate across the Protocol with a focus on reducing risk rather than capital efficiency.
Gauntlet has already been working for Aave producing the great Aave Market Risk Assessment and various parameters suggestions. This means the Aave contracts are already integrated right? if the pricing for work mostly already done is $2m per quarter what will it be for new work? Reading through the forum seems only minor changes were suggested + a validation of the current model and important deep review - is this worth $2m/quarter?
Since the focus is quite specific on just a few of the risk parameters, the price could start smaller, increasing as Gauntlet provides more recommendations on the interest rate model or other key risk calibrations for the protocol.
How much are the other projects using Gauntlet’s continuous parameter optimisation paying?
With this kind of budget Aave could hire the best talent, full time for the Aave Risk DAO. They would build proprietary models by Aave for Aave - just like banks do

Gauntlet has also performed various ad hoc measures to avoid liquidations for other protocols.
We should also clarify that volatility and parameter adjustments are largely misunderstood in DeFi and will not be as frequent as users suspect. As mentioned, we look forward to coordinating with a Risk DAO and broader community to get the cadence and messaging just right.
Unfortunately, your example can not be implemented in the protocol as it stands today. Previously there had been discussion of supply/borrow caps that could be updated dependent on specific positions but maybe someone more familiar with upcoming protocol upgrades can chime in with the status on that.",59,66.8,2021-07-26
['Proposal: Dynamic Risk Parameters'],"@Aavenger Thank you for the hard-hitting questions. I will attempt to answer all of your specific questions. Questions I interpret as prompts for the community to consider, much appreciated because this is an ARC, I will skip.



 Aavenger:

Based on the current ARC, no one would even be working full-time for the Aave Protocol right?


Correct and we would suggest this is not preferred. Monitoring and managing risk for numerous protocols allows our data scientists and engineers to improve our models ahead of realization events occurring on Aave.



 Aavenger:

what about other risk parameters and other risks?


Those highlighted as Out of Scope were called out for three main reasons. First, they broadly do not impact our target metrics and would make our impact less measurable. Second, they are permissions on the riskAdmin role that we wanted to be clear would not be exercised. Third, Reserve Factor is the only risk parameter excluded because it is used to sustain the DAO rather than cover solvency risk.



 Aavenger:

This means the Aave contracts are already integrated right?


Aave v1 and v2 contracts are integrated into our platform along with dozens of other protocols—including some in which no commercial relationship exists.



 Aavenger:

How much are the other projects using Gauntlet’s continuous parameter optimisation paying?

['Proposal: Dynamic Risk Parameters'],"@inkyamze

['Proposal: Dynamic Risk Parameters'],"@Retropunk @Anono @A5burger Thank you for explaining your rationale here. Regardless of the vote’s outcome we appreciate getting as much feedback from the community as possible.



 A5burger:

You mention you have 21 full time staff


We have hired 4 more people and will continue to do so since first posting the ARC. Building and maintaining our platform requires significant resources.



 Anono:

in the face of very clear regulatory battles that are coming.


We suspect anyone in this forum/community has similar concerns. Gauntlet sure does. We would hope Aave user protection (“consumer protection”) through active risk management may be seen favorably by regulators.



 Retropunk:

and a very unclear impact on revenues.


We would like to highlight that liquidity mining or adding additional assets have similar difficulties. Does liquidity mining drive only short-term growth? Does adding additional assets add tail risk to the protocol? Yes, they drive protocol revenue but how much is tough to pinpoint. All protocol changes will face this difficulty and that is why we called out metrics where we can drive the most impact.
One thing from most previous AIPs is clear, the Aave community has a long-term vision and is willing to experiment in the short term. Governance can and should evaluate Gauntlet’s impact quarterly and decide whether to renew our engagement.",44,28.8,2021-08-07
['Proposal: Dynamic Risk Parameters'],"Sorry, in proposals adding additional asset like PAX or AMPL I could not find any fee calculations like yours.
You say yourself it is difficult to determine the benefit, but you are very precise in calculating the fees. And how should the Aave stakeholders should evaluate quarterly the benefits of Gauntlet?",42,28.4,2021-08-07
['Proposal: Dynamic Risk Parameters'],"Here my opinion as a community member about the proposal.
First, I think the Gauntlet team is most probably the best in the industry in what rewards risk analysis on decentralized protocols, knowing first-hand how robust their technology and methodology are. In addition, they have a good knowledge of the protocol and its assets, and how evolved over time since V1, which makes them a perfect candidate for this kind of task. So I support having some type of collaboration between Gauntlet and the Aave Protocol.
That being said, I believe that the future of risk analysis concerning the Aave Protocol, should be completely led by the being-built Aave Risk DAO, with members of it fully committed to Aave. In addition to that, it is obvious that with the magnitude of a protocol like Aave, it is necessary to have external advisory firms working together with the Aave Risk DAO, but the role (as it is actually defined on this initial proposal by @inkyamze ) is as such, advisors.
Taking that into account, I consider the cost vs service of this proposal not adequate. At the current price of AAVE, we are talking about a total of $2.2m for a quarter, for an advisory service on a not fully dedicated team.
I would like to see multiple teams with heterogeneous methodologies advising on risk for the protocol, as that is the most healthy scenario in my opinion, and if all the cost would be similar to the one of this proposal, I don’t see it sustainable with the same terms.",44,128.8,2021-08-07

['Proposal: Dynamic Risk Parameters'],"I appreciate the work put into this proposal and I like the dashboard.
I say we include in this proposal hard financial targets the Gauntlet must hit for AAVE in order to secure the majority of the compensation they are seeking here. I would also support a longer vesting period (4 years not 6 months) to ensure the changes are to the protocol are not short term in nature.
It looks like even if your initiatives fail to improve the economics for Aave holders you get paid in every scenario?
“Gauntlet’s risk management base fee is 10 basis points annually, derived from a conservative estimation of the impact from dynamic risk parameters.”
So you are basically saying more utilization = efficiency.  I think this needs to be more fleshed out b/c I can’t quite figure out where Aave users are getting the value we are paying Gauntlet. If that could be more obvious I could be supportive of this proposal.",44,63.8,2021-08-07
['Proposal: Dynamic Risk Parameters'],@Retropunk - happy to do that. Neither I nor Pantera have any direct / financial / etc. exposure to Gauntlet.,46,59.2,2021-08-07
['Proposal: Dynamic Risk Parameters'],"Gauntlet should work directly with Zerion or Instadapp, not charge service fee from AAVE community.
There should be different layers on defi, AAVE should minimumize potential risk and being the No.1 on borrow/lending, The key is being stable/consistent and low risk.",46,29.2,2021-08-08
['Proposal: Dynamic Risk Parameters'],"As an Aave user and an experienced tradfi risk manager, here is my view on the above proposal:

It make sense for Aave to strengthen its risk monitoring and reporting to bring more information and efficiency to its protocol user and also to regulators - when regulators will look into Aave they will want a strong risk management function and a strong accountability from Aave’s team. Asking external provider to contribute make sense.
Beyond choosing Gauntlet, the question is what is the expected role and the associated price for it. There is a role of software provider (tool, data) - good idea to buy rather than built a risk system that cost so much to banks and a role as risk advisor on risk methodologies (parameters calibration, indicators…). Looking at those 2 roles (is Gauntlet doing both?) I don’t see how you can justify the cost.  As it is said, with 8M/year you can have a large team dedicated to your protocol; here it is a payment to use a software that seems to also be shared with other protocols and already linked with aave systems. and for the advisory part, not sure what it means.
The only backstop is that it can be revoked quarterly but will we be able to do it when all the reports and data are used by the community/investors/regulators and Aave risk team relies on Gauntlet to recalibrate risk parameters. The fee calculation could take into account revenues; with TVL only,we won’t see revenues going down as margin reduces with more competitive/mature markets; also with such fee structure, gauntlet is a not just a software provider but a proper stakeholder of Aave (neither good or bad, just factual).
Ideally, this Gauntlet proposal should be put in competition/compared to a benchmark and reviewed/discussed between Aave risk team and the upcoming Aave risk DAO

Why not stopping the migration, say in two months from now, and recoup the remaining AAVE to refurbish the Aave reserve? Even if half of the remaining LEND holders migrate once an end date is decided, that would still be around 75M worth of AAVE that can be used for protocol growth.

It is highly probable that as @TheDoo mentions, one of the main sources of non-migration is people who lost access to the wallet, which makes the AAVE tokens permanently locked. As the AAVE token is the main mechanism of governance/coordination of the Aave community, I don’t think it makes sense to just leave them locked, having ways or put them to better use for the community.
At the same time, I think it is important to keep a way for people with provable reasons of not have done the migration (point 2 of @TheDoo ), to migrate for a bit longer time than the 2 months proposed. As the funds on the Aave DAO Treasury will almost 100% not be spent during the next year (probably more), there could be a more ad-hoc mechanism to do the migration for those individuals, case-by-case if requested.",18,23.6,2021-07-25

['Increasing liquidation threshold on Polygon'],"I was wondering about this aspect of the security of Aave, the protocol has matured a lot and there are now efficient liquidators ready to slash any too uncautious mind. But the protocol should also protect the users and of course avoid slashing anyone if the system stability isn’t compromised.
So I would like to talk about $MATIC and $AAVE having both 50% borrow capacity and 65% Liquidation threshold.
I completely understand the 50% because of volatility of these assets and being overexposed to those as collateral could be harmful. However I like 65% is pretty few.
Having like $AAVE $MATIC and $ETH in equivalent proportion brings the overall liquidation threshold to 0.71 and the borrow capacity to 0.6.
Even being cautious and borrowing to 0.4 of borrowing capacity, if the price of the assets goes down half, that would bring the account to 0.8 and triggering the threshold.
And this is considering having $ETH with 82.5% of liquidation threshold which brings stability here. Having just these two honorables assets would trigger the liquidation with a 39% drop of the price of these assets.
But such events do not happen in a second on these assets, and many bots have had enough time to take care of the liquidations and arbitrages of even more uncautious users, renforcing the stability and safety of the Aave protocol along the way.
So while I understand the limited borrowing capacity for such assets, I don’t really get why 70 or 75% liquidation threshold shouldn’t be considered. That could bring more opportunity to be confident in using Aave liquidities to explore interesting opportunities Polygon ecosystem offers.
At 70% of LT for $AAVE and $MATIC that would bring the overal LT to 75% protecting against 46.7% drop, which is way better to protect just getting caught by the dip.
At 75% of LT it is 77% overall LT, and protects against 49% drop, which is very good.
Managing these kind of positions could be at risk for an unaware user, while the security of the protocol doesn’t seem so compromised in the case of a small increase of some LT, like $WBTC $AAVE or $MATIC. And that would give users more time to realize positions could be at risks, while adding no structural risk to end up over-collateralized on these assets because of the low Borrowing Capacity.
The rates can be checked at Polygon Market - Risk.

['Update on Symphony Finance progress'],"Hi everyone,
This is Kakashi from the Symphony finance team. Symphony finance allows users to create limit orders by depositing the sell asset. The sell asset is deposited to a yield generating protocol like Aave. This feature allows limit orders to earn yield for the time they are on the order book. The executor automatically trades the initial deposit + yield earned for the buy asset if the price constraints are satisfied. The order creator receives the buy assets automatically when the order is filled. The executor receives a small fee for executing the orders as they have to bear the expenses for running the relayer service and transaction costs.
We received a grant from Aave Grant DAO a month ago and made some progress that I would like to share.

Current Progress:

Aave yield adapter to deposit and withdraw assets from Aave.
Feature to withdraw WMATIC (or others in future) rewards.
As Aave provides WMATIC rewards to the depositor, we have designed the system so every order can get fair rewards.
Feature to migrate yield strategy for an asset.
This will allow the governance to migrate the yield strategy in the future.
Deployed Beta version on testnet (Polygon Mumbai).
Beta version has been deployed on the Mumbai testnet, which allows users to create & cancel orders from the user interface. Currently, the USDC token gets deposited to Aave for generating interest.


Plans:

[ ]  External security audits.
[ ]  More testing (unit and integration).
[ ]  Bug fixes.
[ ]  Polygon mainnet launch.

['ARC: Proposal to add support for renBTC'],"Hello Aave community,
I humbly submit this proposal to add support for renBTC.
Ren Project Background
Ren Project developed and launched RenVM, a byzantine fault-tolerant protocol that provides ECDSA threshold key generation and signing via sMPC, which allows RenVM to securely manage (ECDSA) private keys of different assets like Bitcoin, and wrap these assets on smart-contract chains like Ethereum. Since launch, RenVM has processed $847m (77.8k BTC) in total volume of Bitcoin going to and from Ethereum (figures are at time of writing and are growing). renBTC comes in at 2nd place for BTC on Ethereum making up roughly 19% of the supply (22k BTC), with wBTC at 74% (89k BTC). In addition, there is over $200m (18,299 BTC) in liquidity locked in Curve pools between the Ren and sBTC pools.
renBTC is a tokenized representation of BTC on the Ethereum blockchain. It is implemented as a standard ERC-20 contract, and backed 1:1 with real BTC locked in RenVM, a decentralized custodian. It is redeemable at any time for real BTC. Individuals can acquire renBTC by minting it with real BTC via the RenBridge.
In addition, Aave is one of the original members of the Ren Alliance and currently supports the Ren token itself (https://medium.com/renproject/introducing-the-ren-alliance-fde594450113). Given 1) renBTC’s price peg to BTC and 2) the ease at which users are able to swap between BTC, wBTC, and renBTC through the Renbridge, wbtc.cafe, and the Curve pools, the price of renBTC can quickly and easily be arbitraged to the price of BTC supporting a healthy lending and flash loan market.
RenBTC is currently supported by:

Curve
Yearn Vaults
Uniswap + Mooniswap
Uma Protocol
Cream
Huobi
Pillar
Loopring
VirgoX

renBTC is in the process of integrating with:

Akropolis Delphi
Polkadot/Acala Network
Cosmos/Terra
Solana
Binance Smart Chain
Bancor
And many more (See Ren Alliance and Ecosystem updates in Ren’s Medium)

About RenVM
RenVM is a byzantine fault-tolerant protocol that provides ECDSA threshold key generation and signing via sMPC. What makes RenVM unique is that it does all key management and rotation using its sMPC based protocol that the team has pioneered. The state, inputs, and outputs of all programs that RenVM runs (e.g. ECDSA private keys) are kept hidden from everyone, including the Darknodes that power it.
This allows RenVM to securely manage (ECDSA) private keys of different assets, making it possible to mint or burn tokenized representations of these assets on external blockchains in a trustless, permissionless, and decentralized manner.
One of the core features of RenVM is bringing BTC to Ethereum (i.e renBTC). renBTC serving as collateral within the Aave ecosystem is the sole focus of this application, although RenVM also supports renBCH and renZEC.
(Citing the MakerDAO Improvement Proposal that passed
https://forum.makerdao.com/t/renbtc-mip6-collateral-application/2971)
I’ve pasted the TL;DR for RenVM from the Ren Wiki below:
RenVM is a decentralized crypto asset custodian that:

enables universal interoperability between blockchains: anyone can use RenVM to send any asset to any application on any chain in any quantity.
has robust security: large bonds, large shard sizes, and continuous shuffling make RenVM extremely difficult to attack, even for irrational adversaries. In the unlikely event of a successful attack, RenVM can restore lost funds.
is scalable: as more assets are locked into the custody of RenVM, the algorithmic adjustment of fees allows RenVM to automatically scale its capacity to meet demand.
provides an optimal user experience: users can interact with multiple assets, applications, and chains with only one transaction.

The benefits of onboarding renBTC for Aave include:

Diversification of BTC assets as currently Aave only supports wBTC.
Increased adoption of Aave usage by renBTC users.
Increased Total Value Locked (Market Size on Aave’s dashboard) with renBTC users depositing their assets as collateral.
If renBTC is onboarded and subsequently, RenJS is integrated into Aave, Aave/renBTC users will have the abilities to directly 1) deposit/lend BTC into Aave in a single BTC transaction and 2) pay-off/withdraw real BTC in a single Ethereum transaction. An example of a RenJS integration is with Curve (https://www.curve.fi/ren/deposit)

RenVM is currently in its sub zero phase. It is not currently a decentralized custodian, it is a federated network that currently only consists of the REN team members.
However assuming that team successfully progresses along the road to decentralisation there is a risk with the collateralisation and economic security model.

There are multiple centralized assets currently listed on Aave (including wBTC, which Ren cofounded with Kyber and BitGo), it always comes down to risk management. RenVM is being decentralized over time in a slow fashion exactly to keep the risks low and the users safe. More non-team members will be added to the permissioned core over the coming months, and later down the line it can be completely voted out by Ren governance, with only public nodes remaining and securing the network.



 state:


Wait until their plan of deposits being fully backed by REN bonds comes true : right now REN bonds cover only around 10% of the renBTC minted



This is again not necessary at this stage size as a permissioned core is securing the network. The network won’t go fully decentralized unless the bonded values and custodied values have been balanced, and this can easily be done by changing the fees for mint and burns, making burns cheaper to reduce TVL, and increasing minting fees to reduce incoming TVL. Of course there are many other things being done to improve the collateralization ratio, such as more integrations which will generate more volume and increase the bonds’ value.

['ARC: Proposal to add support for renBTC'],"Disclosure: I’m a Ren Darknode owner and have the most to lose (and benefit) from RenVM’s security model.
A few clarifications are in order:
Regarding centralization risks:
RenVM uses secure multi-party computation (sMPC) to power its network of nodes (collectivity called RenVM). What makes RenVM unique is that it uses sMPC and this essentially allows for a (one) private key to be broken up into small pieces, amongst all the nodes, that then collectively come together and sign an ECDSA key (i.e. a BTC private key) whenever they are requested to mint and burn assets (BTC, renBTC, etc). A very important aspect of sMPC is that no one node knows the private key, the info is hidden from everyone, including the nodes themselves.
These 13x randomly geo-distributed (Greycore) nodes use sMPC to keep the key safe. Nodes are run by the team at the moment, expanding to others at the inception of Mainnet Zero. Sharding (the use of multiple private keys), also comes in the next phase.
What does it really take to make RenVM insecure?  From the team’s post https://medium.com/renproject/renvm-and-the-road-to-decentralisation-72213c3bee3aon security and decentralization.
""A malicious adversary would need to successfully compromise 5+ machines without being noticed. Even then, the adversary would not have root access to the machine, and would not be able to read that nodes’ shares of the MPC-generated private key.
Of course, until we progress further through phase sub-zero, the Ren team could collude internally. The team has obvious and strong incentives not to do so: we would be throwing away years of hard work and reputation, we would be legally pursued, have no way to spend the inevitably blacklisted assets, and we would lose all future value that can be captured by successfully progressing RenVM into its final autonomous design. Although the team is temporarily maintaining control over RenVM, we see this as a necessary step in the early days of the network to keep it maximally secure.""
Regarding Audits
The RenVM team has undertaken numerous, progressive audits of the RenVM codebase. When Chaosnet was  launched it was specifically promoted by the team as an unaudited, pre-production implementation released for testing purposes, reference to this language is below:
“Anyone with 10,000 REN can participate, but with the understanding that this is an unaudited, pre-production version of RenVM.” Link: https://docs.renproject.io/chaosnet/chaosnet-darknode.
So, ChaosNet was never meant to be audited, it was promoted as unaudited, and everyone engaging with that system understood this to be the case. Chaosnet is no longer operational. RenVM is now on mainnet.
RenVM is an audited implementation. In fact, RenVM has had 5 Audits to date (Smart contracts, sMPC algorithm, sMPC code implementation, Hyperdrive 2x) , with more to come, 4 of which can be found here: https://github.com/renproject/ren/wiki/Audits.
RenVM is one of the most well-audited platforms in the young DeFi ecosystem. And the team has consistently taken security extremely seriously as indicated by their slow road to mainnet (key security audits needed to be completed first before they launched), their careful auditing of all aspects of the code, and their commitment to progressive decentralization that puts users first in terms of ensuring they do not fall victim to programming and user errors that put their BTC and other assets at risk.
Regarding Undercollateralization
The collateralization ratio is not relevant at this stage given that the protocol is in the SubZero phase.
Work is underway by the RenVM team to further refine this aspect of the protocol, subject to governance given what we have seen regarding key early-stage use cases for RenVM.
The security model referenced above and the greycore, as well the inherent safety features in RenVM make attacking it exceedingly difficult.

The team recently confirmed that they aim to be fully decentralized by the end of this year. Of course, no one can guarantee that this will really happen, but we are at least not talking years. You might already know this article (https://medium.com/renproject/renvm-and-the-road-to-decentralisation-72213c3bee3a), but still I want to highlight that the team has chosen to be not fully decentralized in this stage, as they want to guarantee network safety at any time.

Another argument from your side was the bonded value is not able the secure the network. That would be correct if REN were already fully decentralized.

Great question! We are debating these exact topics and the proper path forward in the Ren Telegram and Ren Forum. Please feel free to come and offer your constructive criticism to contribute to Ren’s planning for even greater security and stability. 
As a high level summary, Ren has multiple levers (Mint %, Burn %, and Continuous % fees) that can be adjusted to 1) affect volume and 2) affect intrinsic Ren token value (which would increase bonded value aka TVB). Ren is also working with multiple organizations part of the Ren Alliance to increase number of integrations (see original post)
In addition, currently, you need 100k Ren tokens to spin up and operate a dark node (which adds to the TVB). There are also ongoing discussions in the forum to create pools of $Ren token liquidity that would receive portions of darknode fees (at an appropriate % that would be fair to both dark nodes and stakers). This would also increase TVB and increased locked $Ren allowing for a more stable price.

Migrate the AAVE/WETH aBPT Safety Module to Balancer v2.
Paragraph Summary
There is currently ~$370 million staked in the Safety Module in the form of AAVE/WETH 80/20 aBPT on Balancer v1. This recently passed proposal allocated 12,500 BAL per week to this pool until September 20th, after which the rewards may be removed at the discretion of the Balancer liquidity mining committee. Migrating the AAVE/WETH pool to Balancer v2 will enable access to the new features of v2 and make it possible for the liquidity mining committee to potentially continue allocating BAL rewards to aBPT stakers.
Motivation
Balancer v2 brings a myriad of advantages and technical innovations compared to v1. The most pertinent ones to this discussion are significantly reduced gas costs on trades, more trading opportunities thanks to the Vault architecture, and more visibility on the new v2 interface. It is reasonable to expect an increase in TVL as users will be able to easily find the pool and see accurate reward calculations. It’s also likely to see increased volume/swap fees as more trading opportunities will be available due to the Vault’s gas optimized multi-hop capability.
Specification
A new two-token oracle pool could be created on Balancer v2 with the help of Balancer Labs. The specifics of how the migration will take place requires some input from the Aave dev team so this can be fleshed out in the future as discussion evolves.
Note: I am here as a Balancer community member and not part of the Balancer Labs team. Happy to answer any questions about this though

['ARC: Provide better oracle mechanism for correlated assets'],"Updating my post to match community guidelines.
Proposal: Make use of multiple price feeds in the oracle for highly correlated assets to reduce the risk of unnecessary liquidations. For now, this includes the oracles for USDC, USDT, DAI, and SUSD, but could be expanded as Chainlink feeds are added. For a given asset X, the proposal is to use the X → USD price feed and the ETH → USD price feed to derive the X → ETH price. For example:
USDC → USD → ETH
USDT → USD → ETH
DAI → USD → ETH
YFI → ETH (unchanged)
Rationale: AAVE currently uses Chainlink as the primary oracle for all assets, which is a very resilient oracle network and is extremely difficult to manipulate. But the way Chainlink feeds are implemented in AAVE create unnecessary volatility for stablecoin pairs, which makes borrowing unnecessarily risky. This is because all stablecoin prices are converted to their ETH equivalent via the chainlink oracle. This creates volatility for a few different reasons.

There is a 1% allowed deviation from the median price before the price feed for any asset will update. This means that the assets can increase your debt ratio by about 2% by just random chance alone.
Different stablecoins are used in different markets. In the short term volatility situation of a market crash, stablecoin prices when converting to ETH will behave differently by asset because the liquidity for each asset pair is different. This can skew comparisons between stablecoins intensely, and could cause unnecessary liquidations.
I’m sure there’s more…

A lot of these problems can be fixed when you note that most of the volatility in pricing happens in the stablecoin to cryptocurrency conversion. If all correlated assets share the same price feed for the volatile conversion, then the ratio between the correlated assets would no longer change due to price volatility. This solution has no impact on any assets that are correlated with ETH, and is win win as long as the solution can be implemented safely. Please see discussion below for more in depth detail on the issue.
It seems to me that the following are required if the change I’m proposing is to be implemented:

Create a contract for each asset pair that aggregates the price from two Chainlink contracts and consolidates them into one price in a format that the AAVE oracle can accept. I built a proof of concept which can be compared to the current feed on Rinkeby for DAI to ETH. This is literally my first actual solidity code so it probably needs some work and testing. I think I’ve demonstrated that it’s possible though.
Submit a proposal to the chain to call the setAssetSources function on the AAVE oracle to point to the new contracts.
…
Profit!

Original post (Safe to ignore. Just here for context.)

Right now, AAVE uses Chainlink as the primary oracle for all assets, which I believe is probably the best oracle to use. But the way it is implemented is unnecessarily volatile for stablecoin pairs because of the way that prices are calculated. All assets are priced for liquidation by converting the value to ETH. This is particularly problematic for stablecoin pairs because there is a 1% allowed deviation in the price before it is updated.
For example, a user can deposit 1000 USDC, and leverage that position into $5000 USDC deposited and $4000 USDT borrowed (assuming no slippage). This is the maximum that would be allowed by AAVE for you to borrow, and puts you at an 80% debt ratio. However, the oracle won’t see it that way, because the Chainlink oracle prices converting from stablecoins to ETH are extremely volatile. It isn’t unusual for USDC to be worth $0.99 while USDT is worth $1.01 when using these calculations. Because the prices can diverge by 1% for both the collateral and the debt, this can by random chance put you up to about an 82% debt ratio, which is almost halfway to your liquidation threshold of 85%. Of course there is risk in taking high leverage positions like this, but this seems like a completely unnecessary risk for people that want to leverage stablecoin positions.
One potential solution I can think of is to check a DEX price aggregator oracle before allowing liquidations to make sure that USDC isn’t actually worth only $0.99 and that tether isn’t worth $1.01. Another solution is simply to change AAVE to use USD as the base price for the oracle calculations, as stablecoin price calculations have much less variance in Chainlink when converting to USD. Of course that would be awful for people that are trying to distance themselves from USD, but pegging everything to a volatile asset like ETH seems like a bad alternative for a lending platform.
Am I talking crazy? Let me know. Thanks for reading.

['ARC: Provide better oracle mechanism for correlated assets'],"Hi @pakim249 . Your points are really valid for certain cases, like the ones you mention of stablecoins.
Something to also consider for your example of leverage on stablecoins and that can also be problematic in certain situations is that the update of the prices for each stablecoin (in ETH) is async by the nature of Chainlink. Meaning that the price update of DAI in ETH could be updated before USDC in ETH, creating a bit of price divergence in the meantime (apart from the divergence you mention of $0.99 and $1.01.
There are from my perspective 3 type of solutions for this:

Using USD as reference in certain Aave deployments. This helps with stablecoins, but could be not so good for other tokens used as collateral, as their correlation with ETH is usually higher than with USD. So for markets with only stablecoins (or assets hardly pegged to them) and maybe ETH/BTC, could be fine.
Try to find a solution on the oracle side to have more synchronization on the oracle updates. This is not trivial, because systems like Chainlink work so well at the moment precisely because of being able to do async updates, based on a % of deviation with the previous price submitted to the chain.
More speculatively, try to find an “hybrid” solution. Maybe defining on the Aave reserves configurations the price of reference and having an unique source of conversion (ETH/USD?). This could be challenging technically and maybe introduce some other side problems, but potentially worth it to explore.

['ARC: Provide better oracle mechanism for correlated assets'],"I’m not sure if this is where you were going with your third idea, but it makes sense to me to calculate the price of a stablecoin as:
Stablecoin → USD → ETH (the price reference for liquidators) → USD
where currently it is:
Stablecoin → ETH → USD
This way, we can take advantage of the lower variance of the stablecoin → USD conversion whenever those metrics are available in chainlink. Yeah it’s kind of weird but I think it’s the best solution for capital efficiency of stablecoins given the architecture of Chainlink.",32,31.4,2021-06-30

And for the former, liquidations that would have occured anyways under the current method within a relatively short time window (say 24hrs). Would also be interesting to quantify the non-LQM occurrences of depositing USDC/DAI (collateral) and borrowing USDT (non-collateral). Collectively feels like an edge case where liquidations would occur under either approach during volatility and that may otherwise become moot post-LQM.",23,69.6,2021-07-08
['ARC: Provide better oracle mechanism for correlated assets'],"Thanks for the questions. No, unfortunately I haven’t done the work to get those statistics. I’ll work on seeing if I can query the subgraph to get this information. I don’t think this is an edge case sort of issue though. If there haven’t been any liquidations because of this, it is likely because people have adjusted their positions in order to avoid this price fluctuation getting them liquidated, and so querying for that information wouldn’t give us the answer we are looking for anyway.
Also, as @eboado pointed out, the asynchronous nature of Chainlink price updates can create a price divergence beyond the 1% deviation of the price feed itself. I will also try to find data on this, but I’m only just learning how to query the graph so it might take me a while. But this seems like a potentially catastrophic black swan event that is completely preventable by having pegged assets share the same price feed for high variation conversions (e.g. USD to ETH) and have another conversion to the peg (e.g. DAI, USDC, USDT to USD), though I have no idea how simple this would be to implement in the contracts.
Especially with the massive rise in stablecoin usage recently, I think being brought a third of the way to liquidation on practically a daily basis when borrowing another stablecoin should at least be worth a serious look for the largest liquidity provider in the ecosystem. And the fix I’m proposing is to simply use the same reliable price feeds as before, but use more of them!

The results seem to capture the volatility of May 19 very well though, with the ratio of price feeds between USDC and USDT getting to ~0.917 at the lowest point. If you filter on the feeds that only convert to USD though, the lowest result is only 0.977 on May 19.
I also thought about replacing every feed with USD ones as well, but that would actually introduce the very same volatility problem into tokens that are tightly correlated with ETH. This might become an issue at the time of voting. I think the only win-win situation is to make use of multiple price feeds to ensure that correlated assets share the same price feed for a volatile conversion, which still could take the form of replacing ETH with USD as the base asset.
Sidenote: It’s interesting that USDT tends to get to such high prices in particular when converted to ETH compared to USDC and DAI. My initial speculation is that CEXes that operate primarily with USDT update their price feeds much quicker than blockchain oracles, so large price swings would have USDT prices updated before USDC or DAI prices.",19,43.8,2021-07-17

['ARC: Provide better oracle mechanism for correlated assets'],"This is actually a pretty interesting way to factor out the micro-volatility of the stablecoin side in stablecoin pairs. I can see an immediate benefit to quality, accuracy and smoothness of the price points 
@eboado 's points on synchronicity are critical though. With no guarantees on the order of the price feed updates (which are price driven), we could be momentously getting even bigger price divergence.
Maybe one interesting point to explore is whether the price feeds could be updated on demand upon a 1% divergence on the “composite” price feed. I don’t think this is a possibility in the current Chainlink architecture, but it shouldn’t be too hard to implement if the economics work (the benefit from updating the feed so as to reduce divergence needs to be greater than the gas cost incurred by the node operators).
I think I will try to further explore the possibilities of this construct in the Witnet price feeds. I’ll share here any advancements or findings.
P.s.: @pakim249 your code looks just right. Only the virtual modifier in latestAnswer() and decimals() seems somehow redundant to me because I wouldn’t expect this contract to be inherited.",10,97.0,2021-08-10
['ARC: Provide better oracle mechanism for correlated assets'],"Thanks for your thoughts and the code advice! Regarding updating the feeds on demand, my thinking is that the periods in which you would want to update stablecoin price feeds to the composite ones are precisely the periods in which node operators would have to pay the most gas to do so, and their transaction must go through before liquidators if our goal is to protect AAVE positions from unnecessary liquidations.
If we wanted this functionality, couldn’t we just build the logic into the price feed itself? Also, I wonder if that logic would be redundant. The AAVE oracle contract already has a backup oracle, and can be triggered by returning a price feed answer of 0 which could serve as the trigger to change a price feed.",9,26.8,2021-08-10

Could you detail the rationale behind this parameter suggestion. Model risk parameters are calibrated based on market metrics: volatility, market liquidity, and market cap
YFI is already among the riskiest asset on Aave causing systemic risk due to its high volatility, its market liquidity, and user behavior on Aave who tend to borrow with a lower Health Factor making them more subject to liquidation

['ARC: Sell Longs Through Aave'],"Tl;Dr - Use Asset Pools to Allow People to Go Long on Asset
So my proposal revolves around allowing people to go long on an asset through the asset pools. Sushiswap Kashi offers something close to this and I think this is a feature Aave would benefit from.
How does this work?
Using Ethereum and Dai as an example, lets say you want to go long on ETH. Right now you have to follow the steps below

Deposit ETH as collateral
Take out Dai as a loan with the ETH as collateral
Buy ETH with the borrowed DAI
Add the ETH just purchased as collateral

Repeat this process, then if ETH goes up in value, you can sell it and repay the loan which you owe in DAI, thus pocketing the difference.
Implementation
Allow people to use Aave AMM, Uniswap, Sushiswap, as the facilitator of the rebuying of collateral. Allow a slider to choose the exposure (1.5x leverage, 2x leverage etc), and show people in clear terms what their liquidation floor. Wrap this position neatly in an ERC-721, so people can trade these long positions on an open market, and transfer them. This last step is unseen atm, and Aave doing could help the adoption of a new standard.
Why?
Increases utilization of Stablecoin pairs, as they increase thus allowing you to reap more rewards on your stablecoin positions while acquiring no additional risk.  This could be done as a standalone dApp, but I wanted to go through this channel first, because I feel the integration could help it a lot.

Paragraph Summary
Axie Infinity is a Pokémon-inspired universe where anyone can earn tokens through skilled gameplay and contributions to the ecosystem. Players can battle, collect, raise, and build a land-based kingdom for their pets.
All art assets and Axie genetic data can be easily accessed by 3rd parties, allowing community developers to build their own tools and experiences in the Axie Infinity universe.
While still in early access, Axie is ranked the #1 Ethereum game by daily, weekly, and monthly active users. It has generated over 13,000 ETH in revenue (16M+ USD) so far.
Motivation
Add $AXS as a lending currency into Aave money markets.
Specifications

What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?

@Sutton (tw: ssSuttonSss) is an Axie Infinity guild manager and player at @AXGaming_sec .

Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token

**Axie Infinity Shards(AXS) are an ERC-20 governance token for the Axie Universe. **

Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?

By listing $AXS you will be able to leverage an entire nation of gamers.

Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?
**
** Version 1 First half 2021 / Staking dashboard released


AXS holders can stake their tokens through the staking dashboard and participate in governance votes brought forward by the Sky Mavis team.
These votes will revolve around which teams should receive funding from the ecosystem fund, and how the Community treasury should be distributed.

Version 2 - Early 2022
More on-chain votes about smaller issues.
Potentially changing the way votes are being counted from 1 token 1 vote to Quadratic voting.

Version 3 - September 2023 / Decentralized Organization
AXS holders determine which governance framework should be used and how much should be voted on. Some decisions will not be up for debate such as token supply which is iron-clad in smart contracts.
Potential things that can be voted on:


Should Axie Infinity Limited continue to pay Sky Mavis to develop Axie Infinity?


Should Axie Infinity use the marketplace created by Sky Mavis?


How should the Community Treasury be used to reward AXS holders and the broader Axie community?


Should the Community Treasury funds be attached to any yield farming/staking services such as Yearn.finance or Rari.Capital?



How is the asset currently used?

*. In early 2021, the Community Treasury went live. The Community Treasury began to receive revenues generated by Axie Infinity as well as a portion of staking rewards. This treasury is by AXS stakers eventually, once the network has become sufficiently decentralized. A more detailed overview of the Treasury can be found here.
The token has been designed in collaboration with Delphi Digital.
6. Emission schedule
AXS will be unlocked in a pre-determined schedule which lasts for 65 months from the public sale. The initial circulating supply is set to 59,985,000 AXS - 22.22% of the total supply.

['Launch Announcement: Aave Treasury Analytics Dashboard by Llama'],"Hi everyone, I’m Michael from Llama. As part of Llama’s treasury management grant, we just launched our Aave treasury analytics dashboard on Dune Analytics (you may have already seen an earlier version surface on Twitter). The goal of this dashboard is to provide the community with an easy-to-use resource for diving in to Aave’s treasury balances and growth, revenue and expenses, token holdings, and see where the funds are coming from/ going to.
Dashboard Link: https://duneanalytics.com/llama/Aave-Treasury-Finances-by-Llama

Dashboard Overview

Current balances for the Reserve Factor Addresses for Ethereum (v1, v2), Polygon, and the Ecosystem Reserve on Ethereum.
Money In, Money Out, aToken Interest, Liquidity Mining Rewards Accrued, Price Change of Token Holdings, and Total Reserve Factor Balances growth over time.
Current Reserve Factor balances and distribution of holdings by token.
Revenue Sources (e.g., Flash Loans, Reserve Interest) and Revenue by Token.
Expense Transactions and USD Amount by Destinations.
Track the Reserve Factor’s liquidity incentive rewards earned by holding aTokens.
Quarterly Statements for the trailing four quarters from any date.
Ability to set time granularity (i.e. monthly, daily), trailing date range, and go “back in time” to a previous reference date. Default is “trailing 90 days.” (Note that re-running the queries will take ~3 minutes)

Note: aToken interest and liquidity incentive reward rates are approximated by average daily rates.
Early Insights


“Why Now?” for treasury management: Aave’s Ethereum Reserve Factor reached $9M USD on July 31st, up 3x from the previous quarter ended May 3rd ($2.96M), and 55x Year-to-Date ($163k on Jan 1st). Price change had minimal impact on the Ethereum Reserve, since > 90% is held in stables. But the Ecosystem Reserve, which held $800M+ USD in AAVE tokens, was more volatile with monthly swings due to price as high as +$628M USD and as low as -$350M USD in the past year.

Sustained Revenue on Ethereum, but Reduced Incentives Hurt Polygon: For the past four months (April - July), Aave’s Ethereum Reserve has earned > $1M USD in revenue, peaking at $3M revenue in May (based on token prices when earned). The Polygon Reserve crossed $1M revenue in May and June, but fell to $670k in July. Daily Polygon revenue fell 58% after MATIC token incentives were reduced on June 18th ($60.5k/day 7-day avg before, $25.1k after).

aTokens Make the Treasury Productive: V2 earns protocol revenue on reserve state updates in the form of Aave’s interest-bearing aTokens. In the trailing quarter May 4th - Aug 1st, Aave’s Ethereum Reserve earned $41k in interest (0.7% of total revenue), and the Polygon Reserve earned $11.8k (0.3%). Since liquidity incentives launched on April 26th, the Ethereum Reserve has earned ~$25k in AAVE tokens (Polygon liquidity incentive data WIP).

['Launch Announcement: Aave Treasury Analytics Dashboard by Llama'],"Yeah, calculating interest and liquidity incentive rates was a whole challenge in itself. I was thinking about doing a video walkthrough, or at least write up documentation for it.
In short:
Calculating Interest Rates

I created a daily interest rate table, just for query simplicity: Dune Analytics

This uses aave_v2.""LendingPool_evt_ReserveDataUpdated"" in Dune to pull the ""liquidityRate"" for each aToken by time, which was the interest rate, per this: LendingPool - Developers

Approximated the interest rate by taking the average of each day. If we did this by block, I don’t think the query would ever fully run haha, but maybe eventually we could get to that granularity. I converted the yearly APY rate to daily APR with this ((1+interest_rate_ray)^(1.0/365.0)-1)


Compound Interest

We probably could’ve used a general compound interest formula to calculate the interest earned between two points, but for purposes of the dashboard and reporting, we wanted to calculate the interest earned each day.
If we were using scripting language we’d do something like loop, or in Excel pull the previous row’s balance + earned interest as our starting balance. We could use a recursive query in SQL to follow the Excel-type method.
In the recursive part of the query: daily_balances starting line 120 here Dune Analytics , we essentially select our first day of data, then union that with the next day’s data until we run out of days. But since it’s ‘recursive’, the unioned rows can self-join with the previous row’s data, in order to do something like:

yesterday’s balance (balance of the previous row) + today’s difference of tokens in and out = today’s pre-interest balance
today’s pre-interest balance * today’s interest rate = today’s interest earned
today’s pre-interest balance + today’s interest earned = today’s ending balance


For the next set: today’s ending balance = tomorrow’s ‘yesterday’s balance’



This feels kind of confusing in words, but I had no idea SQL could even do recursion until I did this. A few things online were helpful, I think this is the closest to it: Calculating compound interest in SQL | Teradata Downloads",17,38.4,2021-08-05

['Update on JellyFi roadmap and progress'],"Hi everyone,
Alexis here from the JellyFi team. We have received a grant from the Aave Grant DAO two month ago now and wanted to give an update on where we’re at right now:
Progress made so far


At the time of the grant the project was know as L2P.finance, this name has been decided during the hackathon we participated in early January of this year. We rebranded everything in order to better match with our protocol’s vision and our product’s core values.


The alpha has been released on the Kovan testnet and is integrated with Aave. It allows lenders to deposit aDai to earn an additional yield on top of the one they are earning on Aave. Borrowers can borrow Dai directly from the protocol once whitelisted. (As of today we are being the borrowers as it helps us run simulation on the platform).


Where are we heading


We started working on the v1 which will contains multiple new features such as:
 → Order book of interest rate
 → New assets to deposit/borrow
 → Possibility to delegate your funds from Aave using the credit delegation feature (this feature might be restricted to high deposit in the beginning as it turns out to be a lot more complicated on the gaz optimisation side).


We’re talking with multiple potential first partners that would be willing to launch a small borrowing pool on mainnet as our goal is to move to mainnet later this year.


As of today the grant helped us pay legal fees and had been such a great help on the bootstrapping of the protocol, we are super thanksful for that! Hope you liked the alpha and if you didn’t check it out yet, please go on: https://app.jellyfi.io/

"['ARC: Reduce flash loan fees, introduce a fee for 1-tx borrows and add a flash loans whitelist']","
ARC Summary:
Reduce the Aave v2 flash loan fees to 0.02% (with 0.01% going to lenders and 0.01% to the protocol), introduce the same 0.02% fee to borrowings that are paid back within the same transaction (a workaround that many use to avoid the flash loan fees) and add a no fees whitelist for flash loan users.

ARC Rationale:
The flash loans market is growing more saturated with sources for flash loaning or flash minting with lower fees - dYdX has no flash loan fees, WETH10 has free flash minting, Maker has voted on a 0.05% starting fee for their flash mint module. With the market gradually trending towards lower and 0% fees, the Aave protocol is currently lagging behind and losing its competitiveness.
DeFi Saver is the largest Aave flash loans user and we have gladly used Aave flash loans by default for all FL-powered features rolled out since early 2020 because of the number of available assets and great available liquidity. However, with the introduction of our Recipe Creator that includes both Aave and dYdX FL integrations, we can see first hand that many users will gladly take the time re-create leverage management transactions using dYdX flash loans to avoid the 0.09% fee, even though leverage management options are available as single click options in our protocol specific dashboards.
In order for Aave to stay competitive in this growing market and maintain its position as a major flash loan provider, we would like to propose three changes:

Reduce flash loan fees from 0.09% to 0.02% with 50% going to liquidity providers and 50% to the protocol.
Introduce a 0.02% fee for all standard borrowings that are made and paid back within the same transaction, a process that is currently being used as a way to avoid the flash loan fees.
Introduce a flash loan users whitelist controlled by Aave Governance where integrators could be voted in to utilize flash loans without any fees as a reward for promoting Aave and introducing other benefits to the Aave protocol and its users.

This change could have an additional positive impact by pushing any integrators to switch to using Aave v2 flash loans from v1, as we’ve seen that ~40% flash loan volume is still done on Aave v1.

 Michael_Padilla:

At the weekly report * I have read that the utilization was growing by 273%, so if it’s growing why reducing the income?


Looking at flash loans volume at a weekly level isn’t very relevant, imho. Major flash loan volume happens in bursts, accompanying highly volatile market times (leverage adjustment, self-liquidations and liquidations), major farm rotations (refinancing) or major exploits (flash loans being applied to abuse open vulnerabilities).
This chart from AaveWatch shows this pretty well:

Both great points. Thanks for joining the discussion, Emilio!



 Emilio:

I very much agree this should be the goal to strive for here, yes.



 dcota:

In Refinancing operations compounding 0.09% to debt, in one transaction is a significant cost.


Exactly - this specifically is a HUGE issue right now. For example, we had a humongous Maker Vault owner reach out to us to ask about using our tools for refinancing. The protocol fee would’ve been multiple hundreds of thousands in their case, as the flash loaned amount would be their full debt amount. They of course decided against moving forward with the process. This is needlessly lost business for the Aave protocol, in my opinion.



 Dydymoon:

I really like the idea of a whitelist that allows free flash loans for integrators.


This specific point is something I would assume will cause most controversy, so we would agree to have it left out if the rest of the proposed changes depend on it. However, if the community agrees, we’d love to see it included. It would allow us and other similar integrators to utilize Aave flash loans without any second thoughts, exclusively, wherever applicable.

"['ARC: Reduce flash loan fees, introduce a fee for 1-tx borrows and add a flash loans whitelist']","I agree with everything but the whitelist. We don’t REALLY want to give preferential treatment to certain users in the protocol, do we? We have other ways to compensate value added. The protocol should not discriminate on fees whatsoever.",23,29.6,2021-06-21
"['ARC: Reduce flash loan fees, introduce a fee for 1-tx borrows and add a flash loans whitelist']","Appreciate the response, pakim.
The whitelist is definitely not something we’d consider required for proceeding with the proposal.
It was just one idea for a way to drive certain trusted integrators to stick to Aave flash loans no matter what. For example, even with the fees reduced to 0.02% from 0.09%, there’s no reason why we wouldn’t allow our users to have dYdX flash loans utilised by default where applicable (e.g. for ETH, DAI and USDC), so in this sense the whitelist would allow Aave flash loans volume to remain higher or at least more stable, due to constant use within certain apps, which could be an important metric for the protocol.
I can understand your point about the protocol not discriminating against anyone when it comes to fees, though perhaps also consider that currently the same fee is paid to the protocol by a person using Aave flash loans to perform an exploit and by a different person using Aave flash loans to better manage their leveraged positions in DeFi Saver or similar apps.
Again, just to highlight this once more, the whitelist is definitely not something we’d want to insist on including in the proposal if the Aave community disagrees.
By the way, if convenient, please see my post that now showed up above yours, as it was previously temporarily hidden by a spam filter.",22,24.4,2021-06-21
"['ARC: Reduce flash loan fees, introduce a fee for 1-tx borrows and add a flash loans whitelist']","Thanks for the the thoughtful reply.
If we are concerned about flash loan volume, then can I suggest a more radical solution? Why not simply lower the flash loan fee to zero? According to the weekly governance reports, flash loan fees make up roughly about 1% of Aave’s revenue, which is many times lower than it used to be. As the ecosystem matures and offerings are diversified, this revenue will only decrease. This is not a source of revenue that Aave should be concerned about. However, Aave does have a chance to remain the market leader in flash loans and strengthen its image by simply removing this flash loan fee. Oh, and of course we wouldn’t need a whitelist if flash loans were simply free for everyone!
EDIT: Decided I have more to say. I also disagree with the 0.02% fee you propose for flash borrowers. The fact that we can do everything in one transaction from smart wallet applications is a modern miracle that creates a more even playing field for ordinary users. The entire ecosystem is becoming vastly more efficient, as can be evidenced by Uniswap and Curve’s protocol improvements. In my opinion, Aave must keep up with this efficiency, if not strive to be a market leader in that efficiency.",23,24.6,2021-06-21
"['ARC: Reduce flash loan fees, introduce a fee for 1-tx borrows and add a flash loans whitelist']","Thank you Nikola for putting in the time and effort to keep/make the Aave flash loans competitive.
I do agree with the Pakim, why not reduce the fees to 0 where users/protocols have (almost) free alternatives? If the loan fee is reduced to 0.02%, it would still make more (financial) sense for a protocol to use dYdX.
However, as far as I know dYdX only supports ETH, USDC & DAI. So perhaps this is where Aave can charge fees, as it offers a unique service. So perhaps charge 0.02% (or more) on those assets that other protocols don’t support? This would make it a no-brainer for protocols & users to use Aave for flash loans.",17,23.4,2021-07-20
"['ARC: Reduce flash loan fees, introduce a fee for 1-tx borrows and add a flash loans whitelist']","Flashloans are a technology that I find incredible. However, I am disappointed that this ARC did not go to a governance vote and remained at the discussion stage. So I have to re-launch this discussion.
I looked at the weekly reports for the last 3 weeks (at the time of publication W27, W28, W29. Available here: Aave Weekly: Protocol Performance & Governance Update ). The flashloans have generated an average of $102,636 over the last 3. Knowing that the protocol revenue averaged $11,300,127 over the last 3 weeks, after a quick calculation we realize that flashloans represent about 0.91% of the protocol revenue.
This is a totally negligible revenue in my opinion.
So I agree with @pakim249  and @tobias , we should reduce the flashloans fees to 0% to stay competitive against Dydx, Cream or Unilend, whether on Ethereum, Polygon, and soon Arbitrum. However I don’t agree with this whitelist logic, and a 0% fee drop would settle this disagreement.
AAVE being currently the largest DEFI protocol by TVL, this fee reduction would allow any user to borrow for free (for the time of a transaction only) the highest possible amount of tokens (within the limit of the number of tokens available for borrowing), any protocol, and with a diversity of available tokens.
I’m going to digress slightly from the basic topic but I think this is important too.
We also know that the AAVE Pro Market (now its official name is AAVE Arc) should be available soon. In a logic of allowing all players to take advantage of the DEFI, it would be interesting to allow players present on this market to make flashloans. However, I am still not sure if we should lower the flashloans fees to 0% on this market from the beginning. As this market is regulated, we would also have to check if this would be possible from a legal point of view.",17,23.4,2021-07-26

Ultimately, there is no reason that flashloans should have a fee attached, flashloans bring no risk or inconvenience to the lenders, so why should borrowers have to pay for it? Especially when other protocols offer the same service free of charge.

There is still risk involved when capital leaves your contract, although it so small that is negligible. Despite that, people using liquidity for a profit should pay the liquidity providers.

['ARC : Propose an AAVE x CURVE Alliance'],"Abstract:
Aave and Curve are two of the main DeFi protocols in constant evolution and growth with synergies between. One way of increasing these synergies would be to give each protocol some voting power in the other governance.
A few weeks ago, i posted an ARC about a strategy using Curve to increase the revenues earned by Aave DAO. However, to benefit from the Curve system in the most efficient way, it requires to lock CRV.
Aave DAO is accumulating some CRV with the ecosystem collector, but not enough to boost the treasury from the ecosystem collector considering it’s now around 11.8M$ (or 753.3M$ including the ecosystem reserve). So how could the DAO get more CRV?


Buy CRV using part of the funds from the ecosystem collector, but this would require approximately 850k$ to get the maximum boost on the Curve pools.


Propose a token exchange between AAVE and CRV that increase the synergies created between both communities over the last year.


I would like to support the second option, especially because it would allow both communities to diversify their treasury without selling either Aave & Crv or spending additional stablecoins for this deal.
Treasury state:
AAVE:

Stablecoins: 1.3% of the DAO treasury worth 9.8M$
Ecosystem Reserve: 98.4% of the DAO treasury worth 741M$ in AAVE tokens
ETH/BTC & Governance tokens earned with the ecosystem collector including: 0.23% worth 2.05M$ (including CRV: 0.007% of the treasury worth 53K$)

CURVE:
Curve DAO also mostly hold $CRV with 123.9M tokens worth 191M$, there is probably other addresses with stablecoins & other tokens, but I couldn’t find it.
If Aave DAO propose to exchange 2M of CRV (currently worth 3.06M$) it would cost around 10710 $AAVE from the ecosystem reserve (0.41% of the ER) at the current rates.
Purpose:
Aave and Curve are two main protocols in Defi. Both communities have aligned interests to see this exchange approved:
•	Collaborate on a shared vision through governance in each other’s communities: The token exchange makes Aave and Curve governance stakeholders in one another’s communities. Each community will have influence in the other’s governance process, enabling them to best represent their interests and to collaborate
•	Develop synergistic features: This could help create new Aave pools on Curve for the other money markets and using Curve pools as a collateral on Aave while earning Curve rewards for example.
•	Positive alliance: This exchange can increase the synergies, the TVL and the revenues for both protocols. If Aave can vote to get more CRV distributed to Aave pools through the gauges, it should raise the Aave pools APR and so, increase the capital deposited in the pool which increase Curve revenues. Adding AAVE to the Curve war would also increase the difficulty for other players to increase their gauges.
Benefits for AAVE:

Be a part of Curve governance (Vote on governance proposals, gauges vote to increase the CRV distribution on Aave current and future pools)
Increase Aave DAO revenues by using Curve to deposit the treasury on boosted pools
Earn trading fees in 3CRV tokens by locking CRV 4 years
Earn EPS & other airdrops for veCRV holders
Diversify the treasury

Benefits for CURVE:

Be a part of Aave governance (Vote on governance proposals, create AIPs)
Support of the “CRV lockening” by AAVE → Increase % of locked supply
Possibility to earn more AAVE (+BAL) by staking on the safety module
Opportunity to create a pool AAVE/StkAAVE or AAVE/sAAVE/StkAAVE
Use the AAVE tokens as a collateral
Diversify the treasury

['ARC : Propose an AAVE x CURVE Alliance'],"Hello @Dydymoon , very good idea. If this proposal goes through (and I hope it does), it would significantly improve the synergies between AAVE and Curve.
Personally I agree with the proposal to exchange tokens between AAVE and CRV rather than selling tokens from the ecosystem collector.
However, I have some remarks to make.
From the point of view of benefits, either from Curve’s or AAVE’s point of view, you say that this would allow each to take shares in the governance of the other. However, to take shares, other than owning tokens, you have to vote, during the proposals on Curve as well as during the AIPs on AAVE.
It would be necessary to lock the CRVs for veCRVs, but for how long? 4 years? (which would allow AAVE’s governance to have a maximum of voting power). Or less time?
How exactly would it work in a vote? Let’s take the example of a proposal made on Curve.
Would AAVE governance have to vote for each proposal made on Curve?
Would the governance have to vote only on the Curve proposals that concern it (in any way)?
If there are several proposals in a week on Curve, should we make a summary of the proposals in an AIP (or via a snapshot) on AAVE so that the multisig can then vote on Curve with the veCRVs?
If we do a recap of the proposals on Curve in an AIP or snapshot on AAVE, how often should we do it? Every week? Every 5 days?
Also, would it be possible to use a tool like PrimeDAO that would allow DAO2DAO interactions?
Apart from these few questions I find this idea very interesting. Can’t wait to see what other community members think about it.",46,104.2,2021-07-26
['ARC : Propose an AAVE x CURVE Alliance'],"Hey, thanks for the questions and good feedback !
In my example yes the CRV would be locked 4 years, as it allows to earn the best return possible on curve (lock 4 years is 1:1 CRV/veCRV vs 1:0.25 for lock 1 year) but the lock time can be voted
On the technical side, not sure how the votes could be handled, but my guess would be :


The Aave DAO doesn’t needs to vote on every Curve proposal, but only the one that would concern the protocol, and probably same for Curve.


I imagine that it would be quite complexe to make an AIP for every vote so Snapshot seems to be the fastest and correct way to get the community voice for a vote, so one snapshot vote / Curve proposal, before the governance vote with the address that hold veCRV
(Maybe something can be dev to automatically post a proposal on snapshot as soon as a CIP is live & opposite too for an AIP). Maybe @Emilio can bring more details on this


If every vote is posted automatically, i’d say one recap every 1-2 weeks should be good

Knowing that an adaptor for CRV-aware LP tokens and gauge boosting is in the works for the AMM market*, having CRV in the treasury to boost LP rewards could be strategically useful to attract more depositors by reducing the opportunity cost of being in the Aave AMM market instead of something like convex or yearn which also offer good returns on Curve LP tokens.
I also like the ability for the DAO to boost CRV rewards towards the aave pool in the weekly CRV gauge vote, as this could allow to increase the amount of deposits in Aave by further incentivizing Aave-based pools on Curve.

These two are interrelated. In order to ensure sufficient liquidity, I suggest we not lock all CRV for 4-yrs but rather lock it in tranches of various maturities. This would require different addresses as lock duration is pegged to each wallet, but seems like an easy obstacle to overcome.
Further, i fully support using the vote to boost aave based pools as this will lead to mutual benefits of liquidity (both on mainnet and where ever deployments overlap).

Not sure about using different addresses as it would cost a lot in fees to transfer the reserve factor on several addresses,  considering most of the fees are received on V2 address.

I totally agree about considering to use part of the funds on Convex, however as the protocol is still a bit new, we should limitate the exposition. However, if we can exchange that much CRV, we could use some CRV on Convex as cvxCRV to accumulate CVX until we need to extend the Aave boost/voting power on Curve.

['Proposal: Add Support for BOND (BarnBridge)'],"Summary
Add BOND to Aave v2.
Abstract
BarnBridge is building a suite of applications that allows users to mitigate risk across various use cases throughout DeFi. These applications rely on differentiated user profiles, referred to as tranches, in order to create markets for risks such as interest rate fluctuations and asset price volatility. Currently, SMART Yield has over $180M in TVL, while SMART Exposure and SMART Alpha are slated for Q2 and Q3 of 2021, respectively.
The BOND token is used to govern the BarnBridge DAO and allocate protocol resources. Additional functionality is being worked on, related to backstopping certain new features currently under development.
Motivation
BarnBridge is one of a handful of DAOs noted for its sizable allocation of its own native asset (see: open-orgs.info). It currently holds over 30% of the total BOND supply.
Adding BOND to Aave would provide a mechanism through which the DAO could finance growth, decreasing the need for excessive token distributions. Example use cases include: funding projects building on top of BarnBridge applications, paying salaries to key protocol participants, and hosting bug bounties that earn yield until paid out.
BarnBridge earns fee revenues from both deposits of underlying assets and redemptions of derivative assets.
By adding BOND as collateral, the DAO and individual BOND holders can borrow against their position, increasing stablecoin demand and utilization on Aave v2. Additionally, BOND holders can lend out their position for a yield on Aave v2. Given BarnBridge’s direct role as an Aave liquidity provider, the addition of BOND to Aave v2 creates more synergies between AAVE and BOND holders.
To start, it may make sense for BOND to have a conservative LTV and liquidation threshold which can be fine tuned further down the line.
Rationale
BarnBridge will continue to grow as a distributor of Aave v2 stablecoin markets as its SMART Yield integration gains further traction. There are currently ~$109M worth of stablecoins deposited into Aave v2 through SMART Yield. This liquidity is provided without any expectation of being used, meaning BarnBridge is a pure liquidity provider for Aave. BarnBridge is also actively building an integration with Aave’s Polygon market. Future BarnBridge products, including SMART Alpha senior tranches for assets like wBTC and ETH, stand to provide Aave with relatively safer collateral given their ability to mitigate price drawdowns.
Oracle
A BOND/ETH Chainlink feed is available.
Liquidity and Holder Base
BOND has been trading for more than 7 months. BOND is primarily traded on Gemini and Uniswap. Uniswap holds $1.9M of liquidity in the BOND/ETH pool and $23.1M in the BOND/USDC pool.

Add dQUICK as a lend/borrow option on AAVE Polygon


TL;DR

dQUICK is the staked QUICK token and would provide a great opportunity to provide as a borrow/lend option to collateralize on AAVE and bring roughly $80M in aum to AAVE-Polygon
Quick and AAVE are both their respective category leaders on Polygon, the synergism would bring additional utility, visibility, and/or aum to the respective platforms

Contract Address : 0x6c28aef8977c9b773996d0e8376d2ee379446f2f
Project Website: quickswap.exchange

Abstract

AAVE has managed to make a strong statement for the Polygon/Matic Community, growing the user adoption to new heights by providing great APRs through a borrowing/lending platform. As a category leaders on Polygon, AAVE and Quickswap could together grow synergistically further through having dQUICK being a lending/borrowing option on AAVE. At the time of writing there are over 100k QUICK staked on Quickswap which equates to $80M+ in aum that could be brought over to AAVE, fueling further growth and visibility to all users that use Quickswap as their main DEX. This list of users is considerable and growing by the minute everyday as the go-to DEX on Polygon. Recently Quickswap hit $800M in single day volume which not only trumps all other L2 dexes by a considerable and very wide margin, but even ranks among the top of all dexes L1 or otherwise. This level of visibility and adoption presents a great opportunity to onboard new users to AAVE.
Quick has helped AAVE users make the initial move over to the Polygon network through maTOKEN pools and bonus incentivized rewards distributed through LP token staking. AAVE has helped bring new users to Quick by coming to Polygon and bringing mass adoption. Now AAVE and QUICK have the opportunity to create an even better experience both, and often the same, user bases by introducing dQUICK borrowing/lending.

Token Security

Quick is a Standard ERC-20 minted on the MATIC Network.
The Circulating Supply is 220,000 / 1,000,000 and the remainder is being distributed through LM over the course of 4 Years. Only around 50,000 QUICK was set aside for the team with the rest being earned through LM.
The biggest Individual wallet holds 2.1661%, The only 2 other wallets being the distribution Contract and the dQUICK “dragon’s lair” Contract.

Audits

QuickSwap itself does not have a direct audit but this is not an issue since it is an identical fork of UniSwap V2.

Hello I’m a Quickswap community member, I fully support this proposal.
dQuick is receiving 0.04% of all the swaps happening on Quickswap.  The current yield on this asset alone is hovering around 20-50% APR (past 7 days >50%) with over 107,000 Quick, nearly 50% of circ supply) staked in the Dragon’s Lair making it an ideal productive asset as collateral.
A Certik audit is stated by QuickSwap to be underway.
Benefits for Aave:  Aave would be the first platform to support dQuick deposit; a yield bearing asset with $90mm currently staked.
Risk Mitigation:  Quickswap is a Uniswap fork.  However a Certik audit is underway for double assurance.  To date Quickswap, and the in particular the Dragon’s Lair have not been exploited.
There have been issues with the info page lagging due to the volume of transactions.  A temporary fix has been installed and the info page is back up-to-date with the Polygon blocks.  A longer term solution is currently planned.
The Quickswap founders are Nick Mudge and Sameep Singhania.  They are advised by Lunar Digital Assets and Polygon.  Quick tokenomics can be found here:  Quick Tokenomics.  TLDR:  96.75% to be distributed to the community.  There are no admin keys, no upgradeable contracts and the wallet is multi-sig with Nick, Sameep, LDA and Polygon as signators.

MATIC - overview
MATIC is the ecosystem token of Polygon Network (previously Matic) - a 100% EVM compatible L2 scaling solution with current TVL of more than $500M and 200+ dapps deployed across DeFi, NFT, Gaming and DAO space. With the recent rebranding Matic has now expanded in scope and vision and have transformed into Polygon with the aim of becoming an L2 aggregator - thereby providing a developer with all L2 solutions - POS/Plasma chain (mainnet launched April 2020), zk and Optimistic Rollups and Validum chains (part of the roadmap - as seen on website).
The MATIC token lies at the heart of the Polygon ecosystem with multiple use-cases. Primarily the MATIC token is used for paying gas fees on the Polygon network. It runs the ecosystem, supporting top Dapps. Additionally you can participate in the Proof-of-Stake consensus of the blockchain as a validator node and earn 12-14% APY in MATIC tokens.

Positioning of MATIC token within the AAVE ecosystem
Matic token is currently one of the most liquid altcoins on CEXs with daily spot volumes over 100M. The recent Coinbase listing was another achievement - further positioning MATIC as one of the premier altcoins.
Secondly, the whole NFT/Gaming boom has definitely made dapps like Decentraland, Decentral Games, Aavegotchi, Cometh, Polymarket, Quickswap household names in the space.
MATIC can play a unique role in the AAVE ecosystem in following ways -


Lending MATIC
Since MATIC is primarily a CEX traded coin, most of the speculation and activity remains confined there. Holders don’t have an additional source of revenue other than price speculation. With MATIC as a collateral on AAVE, holders will rush to seek yields, in turn boosting AAVE’s liquidity.

Borrow MATIC
In today’s high gas fees environment Ether is becoming scarcer by the day. DEX traders can depost Ether on Aave and can borrow Matic on lucrative interest rates. The borrowed Matic can be then provided in single pool dexes like Bancor on L1 and QuickSwap/ComethSwap on L2 to capture liquidity pools of a growing DeFi ecosystem on Polygon.

In addition to the above present incentives, Polygon aims to become a L2 solutions aggregator. Heavy R&D is being done on Polygon SDK that will support Optimistic and ZK rollups and also give the ability for developers to spawn stand-alone or shared-security chains.
Benefits for AAVE
AAVE would be the first platform on L1 to support MATIC tokens as collateral → attracting CEX liquidity into DeFi. The Aave community would be supporting an Ethereum scaling solution, that’s building on the best features of L1 combined with UX ease of L2 to onboard the next 200M users to the blockchain world.
Also with the recent push by Aave in moving their liquidity to Polygon (Matic) as their preferred L2 scaling platform, users will benefit from mutual synergies.
History
Matic team has been making valuable contributions to the Ethereum ecosystem for a long time, even before it’s public surfacing as Matic Network. This includes working on implementations of Plasma MVP, developing the WalletConnect protocol and the Ethereum event notification engine Dagger.
MATIC token has now been listed over 30 exchanges globally (most recently Coinbase), and is trading against more than 50 base pairs. In terms of market cap MATIC is valued at $1.63B and FDV of $3.26B. 24H trading volumes of >$250M make it one of top 30 traded coins across DEXs and CEXs…
Polygon POS/Plasma hybrid chain is a production ready L2 scaling solution that is 100% EVM compatible, decentralized with 88 validators and battle-tested with 200+ dapps building on it. Average txn/day around 200k and 260k+ wallet addresses. These numbers are increasing at a faster rate than competitors owing to the NFT craze and DeFi initiatives launched by dapps on Polygon.

Risk Assessment and Parameter suggestions
Matic token has undergone extensive security audits by Quantstamp. Here is an analysis based on Aave’s Asset Risk Framework 3 to quantify MATIC’s risks and the resulting model parameters suggestions.

MATIC’s Overall Risk is B+
 



MATIC Smart Contract Risk: B
Matic token was introduced in 2019 as a governance and utility token for Matic blockchain. The code has audits from Quantstamp which can be found above. The token plays a central role in the Polygon (previously Matic ecosystem) as it is used to pay gas fees. Currently MATIC fuels gas fees of around 600,000 transactions daily, more than 24M transactions and 380,000 wallets till date.
MATIC Counterparty Risk: B+
MATIC as a governance token for Polygon PoS network is used to pay 95+ validators today for securing the network. $700M MATIC tokens are staked on the Polygon PoS network ensuring security and decentralization. In addition to this, MATIC holders amount to more than 300,000 on chain across Polygon and Ethereum.
MATIC Market Risk: C
MATIC is one of the leading altcoins and ecosystem projects. Token is heavily traded across all top-exchanges with more then $5B market cap and 24Hr volumes nearing PoS chain’s TVL. MATIC has experienced up-side volatility, similar to most L1/L2 ecosystem tokens.

['ARC : Add LP Balancer v2'],"+1 to moving the safety module to Balancer V2. This has already been suggested here: ARC: Migrate ABPT Safety Module to Balancer v2
I wanted to discuss an idea that would probably require more effort on the technical side but would be very powerful IMO. Instead of AAVE adding new BPTs for every new pool created, AAVE should “see through” the BPT and consider instead the underlying tokens in the pool which would be used in a liquidation event. That is, when liquidated, the liquidation contracts first withdraw the liquidity using the BPT and then liquidates the underlying tokens in the pool.
For example, if I had a BPT of a WETH/DAI Balancer pool that could be used to redeem 1WETH + 2000 DAI, AAVE would consider my collateral the same way as if I had directly lent 1 WETH + 2000 DAI.
This way any pool (coming from Balancer’s trusted factory) that has only AAVE-collateral tokens like WETH and DAI would immediately be accepted as collateral on AAVE, without the overhead of going through the listing process.",20,134.0,2021-07-13
['ARC : Add LP Balancer v2'],"While we move the pool to V2, can we seize the opportunity to enable the stakers of the BPT token in the Safety Module to vote?

Paragraph Summary
Paxos Standard (PAX) was launched in 2018 and is a USD stablecoin that is 100% backed by US dollars held bankruptcy remote. Paxos issues PAX and both the company and token are regulated by the NY DFS. Full PAX attestations are completed monthly and posted to www.paxos.com/attestations.
PAX is used in a variety of use cases including a means of payment for other blockchain - based assets, trustworthy store-of-value, settlement of assets with fiat currency outside of traditional banking hours, and being lent / borrowed on known CeFi institutions like BlockFi and Celsius. Paxos would like to extend the functionality to the DeFi space through listing on Aave.
Motivation
Only PR commits are to list PAX asset.

Paragraph Summary
PAX Gold was the first and is the largest digital gold token. PAXG launched in 2019 with the mission to make the ownership of physical gold safer, cheaper, and more convenient. Since then the token has grown to over $160M in market capitalization and has been listed on a variety of institutions including FTX, Binance, Kraken, BlockFi, itBit, and Celsius.
We have seen an enthusiastic customer base in particular for being able to use digital gold as collateral and earn yield on CeFi platforms like BlockFi and Celsius. Some users however cannot, or choose not to, use CeFi institutions and we would like to ensure DeFi users can experience the same benefits of using gold as collateral and/or to generate yield.
Listing PAX Gold will provide a new trustworthy, secure, deflationary method for users to store value in the crypto ecosystem and help DeFi users build a diversified digital portfolio.
Motivation
Only PR commits are to list PAXG asset.
Specifications
1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?
The AIP submitter, Paxos Trust Company, is the sole issuer of the PAX Gold token. Paxos Trust Company is a regulated financial institution and qualified custodian.
2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token
PAX Gold was launched to provide a safe, affordable, and convenient way to own investment-grade gold. Each token is fully backed by one troy ounce of London-good delivery gold bars held in Brinks vaults in London. Users can redeem gold bars directly or in smaller quantities through our partner Alpha Bullion.
3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?
Gold is an ideal and proven asset for collateral because it has relatively low volatility and is deflationary by nature. From what we understand, most gold borrowers are institutions borrowing to create liquidity or maintain PAXG markets through healthy arbitrage.
4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO, products; and how it overcame stressed conditions
PAXG is available for trading on Uniswap and many centralized exchanges
5. How is the asset currently used?
Primary use cases are buy/sell, trade, hold, send/receive, use as collateral, and borrow.
6. Emission schedule
PAXG tokens are minted/burned based on client demand. The process for minting and burning has been approved by the NYDFS and is regularly audited by a third party. Full monthly attestations available on the paxos website. Market cap fluctuates as users purchase and redeem PAXG.

Enzyme Finance (formerly Melon) – Medium

PARAGRAPH SUMMARY
The Enzyme community and the core team would like to add $MLN as a reserve asset to Aave to further fortify alignment between the two communities.
Firstly, Enzyme is already integrated with Aave lending pools. Enzyme teams is also currently working on accommodating the borrowing functionality to enable leveraged strategies for Enzyme’s users. Hence, Enzyme naturally drives traffic towards Aave.
Secondly, $MLN can be considered as a high-quality collateral: it has a long trading record on numerous CEXs and AMMs, it is liquid, and has a high degree of token distribution. Users of Aave platform would have a greater choice of lending $MLN using it as a collateral as well as borrowing against it.
SPECIFICATIONS
1. What is the link between the author of the ARC and the Asset?
The author is an active user of both Aave and Enzyme platforms. The proposal has been reviewed and vetted by Mona El Isa, Enzyme co-founder (username ElisaFly). Enzyme core team is in support.
2. A brief high-level overview of the project and the token
Enzyme is a decentralised asset management infrastructure built on Ethereum. It allows asset managers to build on-chain investment Vaults that utilise and allocate to the newest innovations in DeFi. Because all transactions occur on the Ethereum blockchain, compliance, accounting, and investor management services are rendered programmatically and at a dramatically-reduced cost to their traditional finance counterparts.
Enzyme has recently rebranded from Melon Protocol. The protocol has been on mainnet since Feb’2019 and was the first DeFi protocol in history to decentralise its governance. Enzyme v2 was launched to mainnet in Jan’2021 and is a completely re-architected protocol with modularity and extensibility at the core of its design.
Since the v2 release Enzyme has seen very strong growth: the TVL has increased by nearly 600% in less than 4 months to reach about $40m. High profile managers like The Yang Express, Techemy Capital, Rhino, Apophis and others have had great traction and continue to attract new users.
Enzyme’s token is MLN, which serves dual purpose: 1) it’s used to pay fees to the network by users, and 2) it’s used to incentivise developers to build on Enzyme. There is currently a well-supported proposal to enhance the token’s economic model, put forward by Tom Shaughnessy of Delphi Digital. Details can be found here.
3. Emission schedule
Up to a maximum of 300,600 new MLN tokens can be minted each year to fund development, Council costs and ecosystem growth.
4. Token & protocol permissions, minting, and upgradability
Enzyme Council has the authority to update the protocol and mint new tokens as per the above.
Enzyme Council is composed of the Technical Council and the User Representative Council. The members operate the DAO using a Gnosis Multisig amongst other tools. The list of current members and operational policies can be found here.
5. Market data

Market Cap: $77 mil;
24h Volume: $5 mil;
Exchanges: Uniswap, Balancer, Bancor, Sushi, Kraken, Huobi, HitBTC, Bittrex, Bitfinex, OKEX. etc
Maturity: trading since Feb’2017.

6. Other specs

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
Enzyme’s smart contracts are fully tested and audited before any main-net deployments are made. Most recently, v2 was audited by PWC amongst others. Importantly, v2 features a unique upgradability approach which allows users to stay in control. Enzyme has an upcoming audit scheduled for July 2021 with Open Zeppelin and receives ongoing audit services from Chain Security all year round.

['ARC: Proposal to Add MLN as a Reserve Asset'],"RISK ANALYSIS
This report is based on Aave’s Risk Methodology and sighted by Alex_BertoG, from Aave risk team.
Summary

The overall score falls within Aave’s risk framework for integration on Aave as only assets with a risk rating above D can be integrated in the protocol.
However, MLN currently does not qualify as collateral due to a low maturity of its smart contracts
As it stands, MLN is not suitable for Aave v2, but may be a better fit for the next iteration of Aave.
It is suggested to wait for the Aave v2.5 release and re-evaluate the risk parameters as MLN will require an exposure ceiling.

Smart Contract Risk: D

V2 of the platform was launched on 11 January 2021. As of writing, the platform secures ~40mil TVL and has had ~8,500 transactions. V2 has an audit from PWC (here). Another audit with Open Zeppelin is scheduled for July. Additionally, Enzyme has been running a top-10 bug bounty on ImmuneFi since 29 March 2021 (link).
The assessment takes into consideration only v2, hence it scores high risk.
As per Aave’s methodology “currencies with the highest smart-contract risk D+ and below, cannot be used as collateral”.

Counterparty Risk: C

As of writing, etherscan shows 5,250 holders of $MLN.
The platform is permissionless and non-custodial. Anyone can create a new vault/portfolio.
Enzyme Council operates a Gnosis Multisig that has control over updates to the protocol and minting new tokens.

Market Risk: C


Market Cap, Volumes, Liquidity. $MLN has a relatively high market capitalisation with medium-level daily volumes. Liquidity on Bancor and SushiSwap is reasonable, although significantly lower than that on CEXs, (specifically Kraken and Huobi, and to a smaller extent on Bittrex and Bitfinex).

Volatility. MLN price experiences high volatility since inception, suffering from large spikes and retraces, which is problematic for a collateral asset.

['Proposal: Allow repay() with aTokens'],"Problem
Aave lists some pausable tokens, including USDT, USDC, WBTC, GUSD*, BUSD* and TUSD*. This means a central admin can pause them at any time, halting all transfers. When a token is paused, it will be bad news for Aave users on both sides. Depositors will be unable to withdraw their underlying token, and borrowers will be stuck with their collateral locked, since they cannot repay their loan.
*Could be paused with an implementation upgrade.
Idea
Let’s add a new repay() function that allows repayment with the correct amount of aToken rather than the underlying. With this in place, when a token is paused we can expect a market to develop for the aToken (e.g. on Uniswap). Depositors will now be able to exit their position by simply selling their aToken. And borrowers will be able to exit theirs by buying the aTokens and using the new repay() function.
Another minor benefit: stkAAVE farmers who borrow and lend the same token will be able to exit their positions more easily.
This would be a major improvement to the platform, giving users much more confidence in using a pausable token on Aave. In fact, this change will create an entirely new reason to hold aTokens: they’ll be transferable and there’ll be a market for them even when the underlying token is paused! This could be a major draw for folks who otherwise hold large balances of a pausable token.

['Listing Proposal: Add CEL (Celsius Token) - ARC Asset Onboarding'],"Hi AAVE Community,
The Celsius team would like to call upon all of you loyal AAVE users to support the listing of our CEL token as a collateral asset. We are confident that having CEL on AAVE would facilitate tangible growth in both of our ecosystems.
Link between the author of this AIP and the Asset?
John Amorosana works under the Partnerships and Strategy arm of Celsius to foster the growth of the Celsius Partner ecosystem, while also working to grow the reach of the CEL Token and Celsius services through various deployment, listing strategies, and in-house product suites.
Brief high-level overview of the project and the token
The Celsius Network is a leading retail savings platform for interest-bearing and borrowing accounts with fiat on-ramp, as well as a market-leading lending provider. Celsius Network operates on a community-first mandate, giving 80% of its revenue back to its users in the form of additional earnings on saving and borrowing. Combining attractive interest rates, low fees, and a strong community, the platform has experienced considerable growth since inception with over 500K registered users and $10B in assets held in the platform.
What distinguishes Celsius Network from other lending and borrowing platforms?


The CEL token is the platform token for the Celsius ecosystem, offering holders increased reward rates on deposits, lower rates on loans, and in the future CEL token holders will also have special access to new products and services.


Celsius has the largest cross-chain inventory of any crypto lender, with a current customer asset pool of $10 Billion, distributed across 45 of the most liquid assets and altcoins.


Celsius returns up to 80% of its revenue to users in rewards, while the other ~20% funds project expansion. This business model challenges conventional banking by prioritizing the Celsius customer community.


Celsius charges customers no fees on deposits, withdrawals, and loan origination.


Celsius customers can withdraw their funds at any time without penalty or fees


Celsius has in-house expertise in De-Fi and staking, enabling us to earn yield for our users and source hard to borrow assets for our customers.


CEL Token Economics
The CEL token is an ERC-20 token that runs on the Ethereum Network. Utilization of the CEL token affords each Celsius user group unique benefits:

Holders: Celsius customers that hold the CEL token qualify for various ‘bonus reward tiers’ based on the ratio of CEL relative to their overall account balance:

Screen Shot 2021-03-26 at 7.44.00 AM1150×454 80.7 KB



More details behind how this dynamic drives the economic model are described here:
CEL Token Flywheel w/ Formula & Math Defined

Earners: By accepting rewards in the form of CEL tokens, earners receive up to 25% more rewards on all deposits of non-CEL tokens.
Borrowers: By paying interest with CEL tokens, borrowers receive up to a 25% discount on interest payments.
Institutions: By paying interest with CEL tokens, institutions borrowing tokens from Celsius receive a 25% discount on their interest payments.

More details on the token can be found here: CEL Token Explained | Cryptocurrency Services - Celsius
Positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why it would be a good borrow or collateral asset.
CEL Token finds its foothold within the AAVE ecosystem as a collateral asset with both deposit and borrow capabilities. Due to the nature of the CEL Tokenomic Flywheel explained in the link above, combined with the ratio of Celsius users who choose to earn in CEL (> 58%), there is a rapidly growing demand for both CEL Token deployment and acquisition. As Celsius crosses half a million users and over $10 billion in assets, the consistent growth and traffic for CEL Token would be complemented elegantly by AAVE’s platform, allowing Celsius and AAVE to establish a symbiotic relationship - empowering the users of both platforms to thrive financially, as well see palpable platform growth, security, and longevity for both parties.
As a supplemental point, Celsius has launched an internal initiative towards financial transparency and auditability by third parties with the aim to have over 90% of our financial transactions settling on an open distributed ledger. Our goal being that any individual, regardless of if they are a Celsius user, have the ability to understand Celsius’ financial position at any given time. This on-going incentive is aptly named “proof of community”.
As a step in this direction, we will provide AAVE and its community with its ERC20 addresses to enable all AAVE users the opportunities to self-audit transactions on chain. The clarity this provides to both the community and your own internal risk assessment includes:

Close the gap on some of the information asymmetry
Allow AAVE, its team, and the community to have visibility into the “ownership concentration”

It is an amalgamation of both the CEL Tokenomics, the parallel growth of two industry leading platforms, as well as the ability to move forward with transparency, hand-in-hand, that we believe CEL would be a great collateral asset on AAVE.

When Celsius launched its product in June 2018, the CEL Tokens from the ICO were locked for ICO investors for 6 months, in order to stay as compliant as possible in an uncertain regulatory landscape. Additionally, the decision was made to lock all employee CEL tokens for 1 year from ICO investors unlock date. Due to a lack of clarity regarding the classification of tokens as a security, Celsius also decided to forego exchange listing for a year after product launch in compliance with Rule 144 of the securities act. The first listing of CEL on a centralized exchange occurred in August of 2019.
All of these factors presented major challenges for CEL trading and the correlating price appreciation. However, the choices made by the Celsius executive team also prevented the speculative trading and price manipulation common among other tokens released during this time.
Though this path was uncommon and met with resistance it also protected the Celsius community and allowed the product to mature to the point of natural price support through the functionality of CEL utility as laid out in the original white paper. As a result, today CEL has experienced steady sustained growth through organic demand and community utilization as was originally intended.
To summarize
CEL Tokens delayed price appreciation was the result of:

Post ICO lock for 6 months
Employee lock for an additional 12 months
Voluntarily forgoing exchange listings for 1 year (in compliance with rule 144)

The above prevented speculative trading, but also allowed for the product to catch up to the utility vision laid out in the whitepaper which ultimately created a sustainable foundation of organic market supply and demand to enable future growth.
Additionally, another challenge we had experienced occurred in 2019. As our company grew across all facets of the business, including AUM, users, and partnerships, we noticed that our token price did not correlate to the internal growth, and price dropped more and more. In November 2019, we realized that this stagnation in token price may be correlated to a market sentiment that we were withholding transparency surrounding the token and Celsius’s actions. So we opened up our doors to the fullest extent and showed the community how we were buying back tokens on a weekly basis to pay back interest. We showed the community our wallets, and encouraged everyone to follow us along in our journey. These actions directly resulted in a noticeable price appreciation, and allowed Celsius to scale efficiently, successfully, and transparently.
How the asset is currently used.
CEL token offers holders multiple benefits including:

Emission schedule
2018 ICO: 700,000,000 CEL
*At launch, there were 700 million tokens (slightly less as any tokens not sold were burned).
50% of the tokens (~325 million) were sold between the presale and public sale, and were distributed shortly after the close of the public sale.
An additional 50 million tokens were placed into a smart contract, with 25m tokens being released to the Celsius Treasury when CEL Token’s price in the secondary market stayed above an average of $1.50 for ten (10) days (meaning the price of CEL has increased 5x from the time of the Crowdsale).
An additional 25 million CEL Tokens will be released in three separate distributions only if the CEL Token price in the secondary market remains above an average of $5, $10, and $15 for thirty (30) days (meaning the price of CEL has increased 17x, 33x, and 50x from the time of the Crowdsale).
Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability
Celsius cannot produce any more CEL Tokens. Once they were minted, the only functionality in the burning of tokens. All were minted in our Token Generation Event (TGE) in March 2018.
Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)
Total Supply: 695,658,160.9671 CEL
Fully Diluted Market Cap: ~$3.4B
Circulating Supply: 383,306,566 CEL
Market Cap: ~$1.9B
24h Volume: ~$8,000,000
30-Day Volatility: 0.818
90-Day Volatility: 1.07
1-Y Volatility: 1.08
Maturity: CEL has considerably less selling pressure due to demand from new customers who sign up, purchase and deposit our utility token. Further amplifying the demand, Celsius purchases CEL tokens in the open market on a weekly basis to pay interest payments to customers who have elected to pay interest rewards in CEL token.
The demand for the CEL Token has improved drastically as we now have over half a million users. As we gain more users, some percentage of those users purchase CEL tokens to benefit from the loyalty tiers, and some percentage of users choose to have all rewards paid in CEL token. These dynamics help to power demand loops for our token. .

['Listing Proposal: Add CEL (Celsius Token) - ARC Asset Onboarding'],"Thanks for submitting this application!
I’ve been using Celcius (+ holding CEL) for the past few months and generally satisfied with the experience. Only comment I have is, I believe centralized crypto services tokens (such as CEL, NEXO, FTT, etc) can present potentially much greater risk to lending platforms than their volatility and liquidity profiles would suggest.

Ownership is highly concentrated
Risk of information asymmetry
Possibility of positions becoming “too big to fail” like the FTT borrow position on Cream Finance

Something for the community and Aave risk function to consider when evaluating the feasibility of onboarding and appropriate risk parameters.",112,297.4,2021-02-22
['Listing Proposal: Add CEL (Celsius Token) - ARC Asset Onboarding'],"First off, awesome to hear you’re a happy Celsian!
Your take on CeFi institutions is totally valid, and one that we’re constantly trying to account for even in how we operate our own accounting practices. As a further out point, we have an initiative internally to make our books more auditable by third parties, considering 90% of our fin-ops settle on a distributed ledger. We want to have a way for people to be able to understand Celsius’s financial position at any time. You might have heard references to this project under the name “proof of community”.
That said, considering this isn’t yet ready, something we can do is provide you with our ERC20 addresses so you’re able to see on chain our activities. While this wont expose our user and institutional liabilities to you as funds route through our pooled wallet, there are some things this might be immediately useful for in your risk assessment:


Close the gap on some of the information asymmetry


Allow your team to have visibility into the “ownership concentration”


Expanding on point 2, (don’t hate me for saying this, i know its all about permission-less finance) but as a way to mitigate against the “too big to fail” risk vector, you could put in parameters for “size of trade/borrow/lend” on value that moves from 2-3 hops from the base erc20 address.

['Discussion: Give depositors the choice to disable lending of the assets they deposit on aave'],"Idea: Give depositors the choice to disable lending of the assets they deposit on aave
Context:
The current state of things on aave is that deposits are automatically made available for lending. (for the assets that are accepted as collateral). I believe that for certain assets, especially for wBTC and ETH, users are not depositing on aave to lend out their assets, but only for the ability to borrow against them. For example, the deposit APY on aave for wBTC is of 0.06%, so it seems very unlikely that users are depositing their wBTC on aave in the goal to gain that 0.06% APY. For those users, the fact that their bitcoin is available for lending or actively being lent out might represent additionnal risk that they do not want to take on. The deposit APY on wBTC is probably also artificially low on wBTC because all depositors are automatically having their wBTC made available for lending.
Possible positive effects:
It’s possible that removing this risk for users that do not want to take it would drive higher demand for borrowing on aave with BTC or ETH collateral.
If most depositors chose not to enable lending unless the deposit rate is below 1% APY for example, this could push up the deposit APY to a rate more reasonable like 1% and create a new market for people that actually just want to lend out their bitcoin, not borrow against it.
Fundamentally, I also believe it makes sense to give depositors the choice to control what happens with their assets.
What do people think about this?",50,755.0,2021-02-03
['Discussion: Give depositors the choice to disable lending of the assets they deposit on aave'],"I don’t know why no one ever came up with such an idea. This is brilliant and would be so good tbh. I mean like you said, they probably don’t want to lend anything but just borrow against some assets. Also I think for some kind of tax purposes this would be really helpful as one action won’t happen, the lending which is, for example in Germany kind of bad because then you have to hodl 10 years to be tax free. With an implementation like this, that wouldn’t happen. Really into this feature. Nice that you came up with that.",41,143.2,2021-02-03

Provides more risk management to users and can even raise the yield on common collateral types. I don’t see much of a downside and it’s something I’ve wanted for a while so I could use my LINK as collateral without giving liquidity to short positions. The 0.01% yield on LINK is simply not worth the risk of lending in my opinion.
I think the ideal implementation for the protocol would be to lend deposits by default, promoting liquidity, while allowing users to opt-out and disable lending for their address. I am not sure how this would affect aTokens from a technical perspective, but I imagine the balance could be fixed to a static amount. So the determination if a deposit is lent or not would be a on an address by address basis, keeping the fungibility and flexibility of aTokens.",29,145.8,2021-02-09
['Discussion: Give depositors the choice to disable lending of the assets they deposit on aave'],"Following up on this, I still believe this is a much needed feature for both greater risk management of collateral funds and the ability to opt-out of giving shorts liquidity (which would give a higher yield to those who choose not to opt-out), In my opinion this proposal seems like a win-win for all collateral depositors.",13,22.6,2021-06-25

['Proposal: Add support for Neutrino USDN (USDN)'],"Hello Aave community,
I’m Sasha Ivanov, founder of the Waves protocol and co-creator of the Neutrino protocol.
Rational
I would like to suggest adding support for Neutrino USD (USDN) on Aave as a collateral asset. The addition of USDN as an asset for lending and borrowing would create new lucrative options for Aave users, especially those interested in earning on stable assets. USDN is one of the few stable coins with auto-staking, that is it provides a native APY to its holders. Therefore using USDN on AAVE as an asset you can borrow would create arbitrage opportunities and should be beneficial for the AAVE TVL.
What is USDN
Neutrino USD (USDN) is an algorithmic multi-chain stablecoin pegged to the US dollar and backed by WAVES. Leveraging the staking model of the Waves protocol’s underlying consensus algorithm, USDN staking yields a sustainable reward of up to ~10% APY.
The core numbers:

Date of deployment: November 2019 (on Waves), October 2020 (ERC20), June 2020 (BCS)
$750,000,000+** is the total value locked (TVL) in the Neutrino smart contract in dollar terms
Variable collateralization ratio in the range of 150-250%
$45,000,000+** is daily trade volume on various exchanges
$560,000,000+** is total liquidity on Сurve.fi 3Pool 

$400,000,000+ is total market capitalization, making USDN a top 11 stablecoin and a top 5 algorithmic stablecoin on the market
Number of transactions: on Ethereum 36,089, on Waves 771317
Number of holders: on Ethereum 1,174, on Waves 31914


The main feature of USDN is staking and generating rewards from the locked underlying asset (WAVES).
Why would it be a good asset for borrowing or collateral ?

More profitable DeFi strategies (including arbitrage and leverage trading) will be available thanks to integrations and partnerships with Curve, 1inch, Uniswap, SushiSwap, YearnFinance, Ellipsis
USDN is a stakable asset (and auto-staked by default with a ~10% APY), so it’s wrapped aUSDN version will be even more interesting for users and we expect more liquidity & volumes for aUSDN too.
More users coming from the Neutrino and Waves communities.

Token (& protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability
The USDN contract is not upgradable. Minting is possible only by exchanging $1 worth Waves to 1 USDN on the smart contract.
Emission schedule
There is no emission schedule. $1 in WAVES can be swapped for 1 USDN, and vice versa at any moment.
How is the asset currently used?
USDN can be used in most dApps, including Curve, Ellipsis, Yearn, Uniswap, SushiSwap, as well as on Waves applications, such as Waves.Exchange and Swop.fi.
А Stress tests
USDN is permanently pegged to USD, as a corresponding amount in WAVES is locked in the smart contract as collateral (currently collateralization is 155%). Two recent occurrences when USDN was depegged from USD in Curve’s USDN-3CRV pool only proved the stability of the 1 to 1 peg, as they created opportunities for arbitrage traders whose activities, in turn, led to the restoration of the 1 to 1 peg.
Risks
USDN Smart contract Risk: C+
Initially, USDN was represented by a set of five interacting smart contracts written in the programming language Ride and deployed to Waves blockchain, launched in November 2019. The Waves smart contracts underwent a security audit by the Beosin security agency. Since then, USDN has been extended via its cross-chain capabilities onto Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. The porting of USDN to other ecosystems is an example of advantages of cross-chain capacity of the Neutrino protocol. However, this also increases the overall complexity of the system, making security audits a more demanding task. The Ethereum USDN contracts are more recent and have fewer transactions in comparison with the Waves-based token.
USDN Counterparty Risk: B-
USDN is an open-source decentralized stablecoin supported by the Waves Association, a non-profit organization with an outstanding track record, and developed by a decentralized cohort of development teams. To ensure that USDN is properly priced within various DeFi protocols, including money markets, synthetic assets and insurance coverage solutions, ChainLink price feed for USDN is already available. With a centralization risk of C+ and trust risk B, this evaluation yields an average of B- for the counterparty risk.
USDN Market Risk: B
At the time of writing, USDN is the world’s 11th biggest stablecoin. The total market capitalization of USDN has reached $400 mln MC. Liquidity is provided on DEXes, such as Uniswap, Curve, 1inch and on a number of leading crypto exchanges with an average daily volume of $35 mln and an impeccable record of price stability that sustained multiple price dumps. In the event of substantial market instability, the so-called emergency oracles of the Neutrino system can unilaterally trigger an emergency shutdown of the smart contract operation. To further stabilize the tokenomics of USDN, the Neutrino system includes the so-called Neutrino Token (or Neutrino System Base Token - NSBT) which ensures stability of reserves on the Neutrino smart contract and is used for protocol governance. For the entire period of existence, USDN has been growing steadily, including the amount of collateralized USDN, the amount of WAVES locked in the smart contract, while NSBT seamlessly supported and complemented this system.

On the other hand though, V2 will open up the possibility of easily bootstrapping new markets, which may very well bring the possibility of creating a separated market for stkAAVE not covered by the Safety Module. So if a shortfall event happens, the other markets are not impacted by the slashing of the staked AAVE.
Would love to hear the communiy opinion on the topic.",69,78.8,2020-10-24
['Adding staked AAVE as collateral?'],"I think it is a great idea but personally don’t know all the technicalities behind it. By combining the capability of staking (StkAAVE) with the use of collateral actually would boost the incentive to stake and secure the platform. I understand there are risks but currently you either have staking or not with the use of collateral. So if users want to use Aave as collateral they are not staking, so the question would be, would enabling staked Aave as collateral actually incentivize more users to stake in the Protocol (this reducing individual staked rewards) and would that be healthy for the ecosystem? And, would this help reduce the risk of the platform since you would likely get more users to stake Aave vs. users who want collateral and are not staking at all?
Again, I like the idea in combining rather than one capability vs the other.",68,53.6,2020-10-24

First Id like to thank the team on behalf of the community for all the hard work over the years, and congratulate everyone on the success, below are some points I felt needed to be brought to attention, perhaps some are wrong but I did my best to read as much as I could before summarizing my thoughts as best I understand them. This is not a proposal, Im just hoping to open a discussion.
Financial risks; I understand the thought process to diversify risks into seperate daos with seperate backstops however if theirs s shared market between them (usdt, Dai, etc) then we are at risk of any of these crashing and blowing through all layers of backstop. I liken this to the insurance industry, local providers (home auto etc) purchase insurance from a national provider, they diversify their risk across a nation (assuming natural disaster only hits one location) National Insurance providers buy Global insurance to further diversify (risk is spread further incase natural disaster effects entire country) great system until their is an international pandemic. (note; a backstop for this was presented 3 years ago as an investment insurance policy to Pension Funds as they are the only industry who fades international pandemics)
Underexposure/UI
Separate market tabs and poor UI make navigation difficult, the website prompts a wallet connection while browsing tabs this is excruciatingly painful while browsing or showing the platform to new users.
uniswap is already missing a button from the v1 market page. adding more markets will exacerbate this issue. Essentially burying new markets from eyes of the market. Shouldnt we be highlighting this?
One market to rule them all
Can we tranche this model on a smaller scale? Can new coins be individually backstopped by whomever proposes the market until a milestone health metric is reached where the backstop gets returned to original investor and the market gets added to the main pool. We can attach some metric for utility strength (dom, mc, investor sentiment) I dont see the diversity in pooling a handful of high risk coins into one market. If anything this increases risk, the same with diluting high risk markets with stablecoins etc. who knows how long tether will be stable.
New coins backstopping themselves would operate similar to an ico in which the MM will fund or crowdsource the backstop the the new market they wish to create. Doing this they can even present a 0% borrow apy to give users a chance to try a new coin without investing too much. this would still benefit aave as they would still need to deposit collatteral in the main market to take the loan from the new market. I dont think there even needs to be incentive in the mm for this as their incentive is in the growth of the market of the currency they wish to promote. As our metric rises based on TBD factors the backstop % can slowly decrease over a period of time. This would allow Highlighting on the main page new coins with much more exposure.

Paragraph Summary
NMR is a token used in the Numerai Tournament and Numerai Signals for staking and payouts. Data scientists (users) stake NMR on their models and earn/burn based on performance in the live stock market. Numerai uses the stake weighted Meta Model of user models to allocate capital in the Numerai Hedge Fund.
Being able to borrow NMR on Aave would enable users of Numerai to more accurately express their true confidence in the models by allowing them to better manage their currency exposure when staking. Being able to lend NMR on Aave would enable everyone else to fully unlock the time value of their NMR.

Motivation
Numerai’s mission is to build the world’s last hedge fund. We aim to replace the legacy capital allocation industry, where redundant hedge funds work in isolation and secrecy, with an open and decentralized network of data scientists and data providers that work together in a non-zero-sum way. This is accomplished via staking with NMR which provides a “skin in the game” mechanism allowing Numerai to trust anonymous models in a sybil resistant way. The performance of the overall system improves over time as models that perform well gain more control while models that perform poorly lose control.
The problem with staking NMR is that users are exposed to undesired currency risk of the underlying NMR position. Users with a higher currency risk tolerance have a higher stake than they would if they were only exposed to the performance risk of their models. Users with lower tolerance to currency risk have a lower stake than they would otherwise. See this and this example of users discussing this issue on our forum.
Borrowing NMR to stake (or short) will allow users of Numerai to manage their currency risk when staking. A new user could borrow NMR with a stablecoin as collateral to stake, avoiding risk altogether, or borrow and short NMR as a hedge. By managing undesired currency risk, users of Numerai will be able to better express their true confidence in their models, which will ultimately improve the performance of the overall system.
Lending NMR will allow non-users to unlock the full time value of their NMR. For example, non-data-scientist supporters or those performing poorly in the tournament can earn a yield on their NMR without having to participate. By giving everyone a way to earn yield and add value to the network, we make Numerai a more open and inclusive system.

Specifications
1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?
I am an employee of Numerai tasked with bringing liquidity and lending to NMR. Numerai is the creator of NMR and currently the primary use of it. Numerai holds a Treasury of non-circulating NMR that it uses to raise funds and reward data scientists submitting to the Numerai Data Science Tournament and Numerai Signals service.
2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token
Numerai is a quant hedge fund powered by a decentralized network of machine learning models. NMR is used for staking and payouts in the Numerai Tournament and Numerai Signals. In the Numerai Tournament, users build machine learning models to predict the stock market with free obfuscated financial data that Numerai provides. In Numerai Signals, users create models with their own data instead. In both tournaments, users stake NMR on their models to earn performance-based rewards. The staked models of Numerai are combined to form the Meta Model which controls the capital of the Numerai hedge fund across the global stock market.
3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?
We see NMR as a good borrow asset on Aave because of strong existing demand from potential borrowers and lenders. Users who borrow NMR can use returns from staking in the Numerai Tournament to pay the loan interest. Users who are unable to generate return will self select out of the tournament and be disincentivized from further borrowing in the future. A broad base of supporters and ex-users who are already long term holders of NMR make up a robust and stable lending pool.
4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components Numerai was founded in October 2015 and began running and actively developing the Numerai Tournament from 2015 to 2017 using BTC to reward top performers, but poorly performing models could not be properly punished which led to widespread overfitting and spam. We created and airdropped NMR to our community in 2017 and switched the Tournament over to staking rules as described in the whitepaper, which better aligned user incentives with Numerai’s performance.
In 2019, tournament staking logic was extracted from NMR contracts into the Erasure protocol with Erasure Bay and the Numerai tournament as the first two applications running on it. We also upgraded the NMR contracts to version 2.0 which made it permissionless (removed all special admin access, disabled upgradability), disabled minting, and cut the total supply from 21 million to 11 million by burning from our own Treasury. Migrating the tournament to the Erasure Protocol allowed us to rapidly iterate on staking and payout rules in order to tune incentive alignment.
In 2020, we created Numerai Signals as a second tournament to bring external data into the system. In 2021, we worked with our community to create the Numerai Council of Elders DAO with the mission of allocating part of the Numerai treasury for the public good of the Numerai community.
The master plan of Numerai is to monopolize intelligence, monopolize data, monopolize money, and to decentralize it all.
5. How is the asset currently used?
NMR is currently used for staking and payouts in the Numerai Tournament and Numerai Signals, and as a burn token for Erasure Bay. It is also used for bug and development bounties to the community and fundraising for Numerai as detailed in the next section.
6. Emission schedule
All NMR that will exist has already been minted. Numerai keeps a treasury of non-circulating NMR that it uses for fundraising, rewarding data scientists, bug bounties, and other discretionary usages. For the majority of people, NMR can only be bought, sold, and burned from the currently circulating supply. In 2018, we allocated 3M NMR to fundraising, of which 130K NMR remains. Thereafter, the fundraising allocation will be considered exhausted and Numerai will no longer use NMR for fundraising.
7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?
All NMR has already been minted. NMR used a delegate contract that originally allowed Numerai to upgrade the token at its discretion, but minting and upgrading was disabled in July 2019 as part of the NMR 2.0 migration.
The Numerai Treasury is controlled by a multisig wallet. Current signers include Numerai team members.
The Council of Elders treasury is also controlled by a multisig wallet. Current signers include key community members.

Initial (very early) Discussion: Tokenised commodities as collateral on AAVE Governance


    Hi @joshman91! 
I had not heard of either Bullionix or Icecap Diamonds before, but thank you for sharing as these are both interesting examples of NFT commodities. I can see that Bullionix has a DGX token like you pointed out which represents a gramme of gold. I believe that chainlink can be used alongside commodity NFTs to ensure that market rates are accurate. 
Non-fungible tokens in general are possibly a hurdle for AAVE. The assets that can be deposited and borrowed on AAVE to this date are …
  

As far as I know there hasn’t been much discussion on the topic on this forum but I haven’t kept up with developments in the background of which I am sure there have been some. Further developments with NFTs and what they are/purpose they serve have taken place for example and so the idea of what they would look like on AAVE now might actually be quite different.

Maybe we can imagine a kind of decentralized auctioneer like the oracles like link and even a special NFT stablecoin that can be collateralised =>

Then, depending on the price determined, the person who owns the NFT has the option of requesting the equivalent in “stablecoin art” and Aave to authorize the deposit of this famous “stablecoin art” in order to borrow stablecoin, aave, eth or any other desired coin
Let’s imagine that this art stablecoin would be accepted by NFT sales platforms in addition to weth or stablecoins so we could know how much art stablecoin there is in circulation, in collateral, etc… of course NFTs can be traded in all currencies and coins but it would be a kind of gateway if one wants to be able to collateralize his NFT.

['ARC:Add TUSD Liquidity Mining Rewards'],"Summary
Hello community members! Last month, AAVE added rewards for lenders and borrowers of DAI, USDC, USDT, GUSD, WBTC and ETH in the incentive mechanism of AAVE. In the long run, AAVE could provide further incentives for other markets to boost users’ supply and engagement in community governance. In this ARC, we propose adding TUSD to the asset list of the liquidity mining program.
Background
TrueUSD(TUSD)  is one of the world’s most trusted stablecoin, independently attested live on chain for 1:1 USD reserves, with billions in monthly volume, nearly instant minting, no fees, and direct-to-bank redemption.
Up to date, TUSD has been listed on more than 70 leading exchanges and live on trending DeFi platforms of well-known public chains. It has gained support from leading OTC desks as well. TUSD also supports near-instant minting and redemption services through the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN) and PrimeX by PrimeTrust.
Rationale
The highly compliant and transparent stablecoin TUSD has been listed on various DeFi platforms and ranked high by rating agencies, with rapid expansion recently. Holders can participate on DeFi platforms with TUSD and enjoy high yields. Not only has it been listed on a well-known public chain, but its market cap keeps hitting new all time high in a short period. In just a fortnight, its market cap doubled, exceeding $1.2 billion. With more attention from the market, more users are crowding in and holding TUSD.
In fact, TUSD has joined AAVE quite early, with over $23.6M market size in its V2 market, maintaining its one of the most stable assets on AAVE. AAVE and TUSD have been mutually-beneficial partners. Many TUSD-holders participate in the governance of AAVE, following the latest development of AAVE, creating a highly synergetic community. So far 2% of the total TUSD circulation is on AAVE, and the climbing space is huge.
We propose AAVE provide liquidity mining rewards for users who stake TUSD by distributing stkAAVE to TUSD-holders. It will incentivize TUSD-holders to actively participate in AAVE market and its governance. We are optimistic about the further connection between TUSD and AAVE.
Specifications
The liquidity mining rewards could use the same 50%/50% lenders/borrowers distribution as  DAI, USDC, and USDT. Please vote for the following incentive schemes.

Add more stkAAVE in each block to include LM rewards for TUSD lenders and borrowers
Keep the existing LM reward distribution unchanged while restructuring the current LM rewards distribution to include rewards for TUSD holders.

We think both options are beneficial, and we hope community would support this ARC

"['ARC: Disable ‘old’ KNC, activate new KNC']","Summary:
Kyber Network Crystal (KNC), Kyber Network’s governance token, has migrated to a new smart contract address. The old KNC has been renamed KNCL (Kyber Network Crystal Legacy) to differentiate it from the new KNC.
Exchanges have mostly migrated from KNCL to the new KNC and therefore liquidity for KNCL is greatly reduced. In light of this, can we disable lending and borrowing of KNCL on Aave, and activate lending and borrowing of the new KNC since the Aave pools cannot automatically be migrated from the old to the new KNC pool?
There is currently roughly 1.3M KNC (now KNCL) on Aave with 166k of this supply borrowed by Aave users. Users can withdraw their KNCL and migrate it (ie. convert it) to the new KNC through a very simple procedure on Kyber.org | KyberDAO's default interface for KNC Staking and Voting
If users continue interacting with KNCL on Aave they are exposed to continuously diminishing liquidity and therefore borrowers might find it harder to repay their debt and the same risk applies to liquidations.

['Revisit Excessive Stable Borrow Rate Design to Become Consumer Friendly'],"During the most recent macro uptrend, the unified perspective of people in governance was to increase the level of disdain for users of the platform and try to suck them dry of as much interest as possible. This occurred in various ways, and was implemented in a way that assumed a permanent bull run and a user base that would be happy to pay exorbitant fees in perpetuity. I propose specifically revisiting the increase of stable borrow rates for V2, and developing a solid structure for those to occur across Polygon as well that does not actively decentivize potential users of the protocol.
Now that the delusion of the most recent run up has come crashing down, I think it is time to fix some of the mistakes that were implemented previously. I dont have the risk assessment background to determine a proper structure for this, but I would call on someone within AAVE who does to evaluate alternative approaches.
There is nothing do to relating to V1 at this point, but it is useful in demonstrating the pattern of disdain for borrowers on this protocol - Forcing taxable transactions by removing stable borrow from V1 to “incentivize” migration and making the stable borrow rate level on V2 uncompetitive and exorbitant is not the path to long term success and creating loyal users.
Increasing baseline stable borrow rates for users of V2:



Base stable rate oracle update and improvements in Aave V2 Risk


    The Aave V2 protocol implements a more aggressive IR for stable and variable rates compared to V1. Specifically, the risk parameters have been set as follows: 
USDC — USDT

DAI — TUSD

Borrowers are taking this opportunity to borrow at a lower risk leading to a high share of stable borrows in V2. This is problematic as the stable rate only rebalances under stressed conditions, losing some of the risk management benefits of the variable rate.

I was wondering if someone would be able to explain to me how the connection of a wallet to the aave protocol works ?
Which information about our wallet does Aave see ? and store if it’s the case ?
And does the browser can see some info as well ? in case of a malware ?
I would like to connect my ledger wallet, but I want to be sure in advance that no one would be able, by any means, to access some info that would allow them to empty my ledger wallet 
Thanks in advance,

['Brainstorming: Exposure ceiling'],"The Aave protocol has some specific risk management characteristics. Compared to other competing technologies, it features:

Custom liquidation penalty per asset
Custom Loan To Value (aka borrowing power) per asset
Custom Liquidation threshold (aka Maintenance Margin) per asset

These risk parameters greatly help in mitigating liquidity risk. A higher liquidation penalty for less liquid assets means higher chance for liquidations to be profitable, which greatly increases protocol safety. A lower LTV than the maintenance margin ensures that no borrowers can be liquidated right off the bat, and provides a soft protection against market volatility (soft because there isn’t any constraint for borrowers to withdraw some of the assets and have a riskier position if they wish to do so).
One thing that the Aave protocol is missing is an adequate strategy for debt ceiling.The Debt ceiling concept was initially introduced by Maker and is a powerful way of handling protocol exposure to a certain asset.
The debt ceiling specifically helps protecting against the following:


Economic attacks: Pump and dumps, even potentially in one transaction using flashloan/flashminting, might temporarily increase the price of an asset even by orders of magnitude, allowing attackers to borrow more than they are allowed to. The immediate drop of the price after the attack is completed leaves the protocol insolvent.


Supply attacks (aka infinite minting): Some permissioned/upgradeable tokens might be attacked in a way where a malicious actor might be able to mint an infinite amount of tokens. Bugs might cause that too (see the recent $COVER infinite minting attack).


Concentration risk: The protocol might become overexposed to a certain asset that might fail for reasons not strictly related to attacks.


In Maker each asset can mint up to a certain amount of DAI. Once the ceiling is reached borrowers will need to wait until the governance increases it. This introduces some UX friction:


Users that deposited the asset and didn’t immediately borrow might not be able to do so at a later time depending on the state of the debt ceiling


Users can’t borrow more once the ceiling is reached


Users can always, anyway, introduce more of the asset in the system as a way to protect from liquidations. These frictions are relatively minimal compared to the safety that the debt ceiling provides to the whole system.
Achieving the same result in liquidity markets like Aave is extremely complex, and impossible to do completely onchain. Since all the deposits of a user are aggregated to calculate the total borrowing power and a user can borrow both stable and volatile assets, there is no way of having onchain at any point in time the exact amount each user has borrowed with a specific asset. Even calculating that offchain can be rather complex due to the nature of the cryptomarket and the way the protocol works (at the very least there would be multiple ways of doing that, each with certain drawbacks).
Some projects already attempted/are in the process of implementing an equivalent or similar approach to the debt ceiling:


BentoBox is moving away from the liquidity market/aggregated borrowing power idea to introduce lending pairs. Although this would technically allow for an exact debt ceiling like Maker does, the individual lending pair approach comes with a whole host of different UX problems (eg liquidity segregation, need for multiple transactions to deposit/borrow the same asset, need two pairs for the same asset for the ability to long/short, and so on) that makes the solution not particularly attractive.


Cream.Finance introduced a supply cap to their forked implementation of the compound protocol, by adding a check on the mintAllowed() function once a certain amount of tokens have been deposited. This solution also comes with some drawbacks: Legit holders of a certain asset won’t be allowed to add more of it to protect against liquidation (something that Maker always allows) and they would be forced to deposit a different asset to increase their maintenance margin. This is a big problem especially for certain entities/institutions for which keeping exposure to a specific asset (eg WBTC) is mandatory. Also due to the nature of how cTokens work, the supply cap does not completely cover infinite minting risk (an attacker might still airdrop minted underlying to the cToken contract artificially inflating the cToken:underlying exchange rate). Moreover, this doesn’t work well with stablecoins (you never want a supply cap with stablecoins as their most relevant utility is not to be used as collateral but to be borrowed).


Although the Aave protocol, compared to the Compound protocol, is technically capable of a true supply cap (since the accrual of the interest in the aTokens is separated from the actual amount of underlying available in the token) i personally believe it’s not the best solution, as i think the possibility of adding more collateral to prevent liquidation is something that should always be allowed.
What I am proposing is a different way of approaching the problem that i call “Exposure Ceiling”. The exposure ceiling uses the LTV (borrowing power) risk parameter to drop the borrowing power of a certain asset when it’s time to reduce exposure.
The implementation would introduce a depositCeiling configuration parameter. Given a token X, The deposit cap would specify a certain amount of the total supply of X deposited after which the LTV of X would automatically drop to 0. By doing so, a user would still be allowed to:


Borrow using X as collateral when the total aToken supply is below the deposit ceiling (being 1:1, the aToken supply closely tracks the amount of underlying in the system)


Always refill the system when needed to prevent liquidation using X, since X maintains its liquidation threshold


Not allowed to borrow more when the aX total supply is past the deposit ceiling.


This solution would cover most of the needs, although it is bypassable: Supposing X is past the deposit ceiling and is being attacked with infinite minting, an attacker might use a legit currency Y (where Y has still borrowing power), borrow from the system, deposit X and then withdraw Y - the attacker factually used Y to initiate the loan, then replaced Y with X to keep the maintenance margin.
This requires that one limitation is introduced. Specifically, users who deposit multiple assets will be required to first withdraw assets that are past the deposit ceiling, if they are borrowing. If they aren’t borrowing, there won’t be limitations. See how this prevents the scenario above:


User deposits Y, borrows Z


User deposits X, his maintenance margin increases but not his borrowing power.


User tries to withdraw Y, he’s not allowed to. The system will require that he withdraws X first.


Debt is still covered by Y


This potentially leaves open a window for abuses if users that are close to liquidation increase their maintenance margin using an infinite minted asset. I believe this is a remote possibility:


Assets that get infinite minted quickly drop to 0. Therefore the most important protection that is needed is immediately after the infinite minting takes place. After that is passed, the governance and the emergency admins have the capability to act accordingly (for example by freezing the reserve so that X can’t be deposited anymore).


It does not increase, anyway, the total debt of the system.


So what do we get compared to the most precise implementation of debt ceiling:


Protection against infinite minting attacks


Limited protection against economic attacks (although the concept can be extended to also consider the exposure in USD, see final paragraph).


Limited protection against concentration risk: Since there isn’t a direct correlation between the total supply and the price of an asset, even by reducing the exposure cap, the protocol might still become overexposed if the asset’s price increases significantly (in this case too, the exposure in USD can improve this).


In terms of additional UX friction:

Users that deposited when the deposit cap was not hit will not be allowed to borrow if the deposit cap is passed
Users will not be allowed to borrow with an asset that is past the deposit cap
Users that are borrowing using multiple assets and want to withdraw (lowering their maintenance margin) will be required to withdraw first the assets that are past the deposit cap.
Users are always allowed to refill their position with the asset
Users are always allowed to deposit for lending

1 and 2 are in common with the most exact debt ceiling implementation. The 3 I believe is due to the nature of the system and I don’t feel like it is a dealbreaker, when we factor in the additional safety this feature provides to the whole system.
4, in my opinion the most important one, is preserved. 5 is a great side effect, that is especially important with permissioned stablecoins.
Potential extensions of the idea:


Implement also an exposure cap in USD: when the supply*price is past a certain threshold, the LTV drops to 0


Hard supply cap: We can have a soft exposure cap and a hard one: users that deposit when the soft cap is reached are still allowed to deposit for lending and/or increase the maintenance margin; once the hard cap is hit, no more deposits are allowed.


This (long) thread is meant not to be a guideline for implementation. The goal is to bootstrap a discussion on this much needed feature and a brainstorming session with the community and especially the users.",75,1895.0,2021-01-18
['Brainstorming: Exposure ceiling'],"This is an excellent proposal, and it’s definitely in the best interest of anyone contributing to the AAVE safety module to read, understand, and support this!
I’m curious to get the AAVE team’s thoughts on the implementation details of an exposure cap (price*supply) as opposed to a supply cap.
It seems to me like implementing an exposure cap would be strictly better from a risk management perspective, but would be much harder to implement. Only implementing a supply cap would not address an economic attack where an asset price gets artificially manipulated higher. If this were to happen, the attacker could borrow with no limit until the asset price decreases or people deposit the asset up to the supply cap.
The implementation challenge is determining when each cap would be hit. A supply cap would be much easier to calculate as it would only need to be checked at the time of deposit, whereas an exposure cap would need to be checked on deposits, borrows, or withdrawal of any asset used as collateral. How feasible and efficient would it be to implement all of these checks, and are there any other benefits/drawbacks to an exposure cap that I’m missing?",50,100.0,2021-01-18
['Brainstorming: Exposure ceiling'],"Great question. If this idea is proven to be sound, the implementation would be straightforward and not really gas intensive;
currently the protocol calculates the total borrowing power (LTV) maintenance margin (liq threshold), total collateral and borrowed amount in a function called calculateUserAccountData()  (protocol-v2/GenericLogic.sol at 3782bfda1a9d0c9fa4c1bd26e69f1f3b3eed88ce · aave/protocol-v2 · GitHub)
The idea would be, for each asset the user has deposited as collateral, to fetch the totalSupply() of the corresponding aToken; if the total supply is past the exposure cap, the ltv of the asset is considered to be 0 in the calculation of the average, specifically here

github.com


aave/protocol-v2/blob/3782bfda1a9d0c9fa4c1bd26e69f1f3b3eed88ce/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/GenericLogic.sol#L196

vars.reserveUnitPrice = IPriceOracleGetter(oracle).getAssetPrice(vars.currentReserveAddress);if (vars.liquidationThreshold != 0 && userConfig.isUsingAsCollateral(vars.i)) {  vars.compoundedLiquidityBalance = IERC20(currentReserve.aTokenAddress).balanceOf(user);  uint256 liquidityBalanceETH =    vars.reserveUnitPrice.mul(vars.compoundedLiquidityBalance).div(vars.tokenUnit);  vars.totalCollateralInETH = vars.totalCollateralInETH.add(liquidityBalanceETH);  vars.avgLtv = vars.avgLtv.add(liquidityBalanceETH.mul(vars.ltv));  vars.avgLiquidationThreshold = vars.avgLiquidationThreshold.add(    liquidityBalanceETH.mul(vars.liquidationThreshold)  );}if (userConfig.isBorrowing(vars.i)) {  vars.compoundedBorrowBalance = IERC20(currentReserve.stableDebtTokenAddress).balanceOf(    user  );  vars.compoundedBorrowBalance = vars.compoundedBorrowBalance.add(






This automatically drops the borrowing power of the user. So whenever the user borrows, his total collateral and the ltv is calculated and validated on the fly.
Example: An user has 50 ETH worth of collateral, 25ETH worth of Asset 1(LTV 75%) and 25ETH worth of asset 2(LTV 50%). The average ltv of the user is 62.5%
If we introduce these changes, supposing the asset 2 goes past the exposure ceiling, the user still has 50ETH worth of collateral, but his ltv is now 37.5% ((0.75+0)/2). Which is the equivalent of having 25 ETH worth of collateral with LTV 75%.
Another change is required on withdraw: to verify if a user has an asset past the exposure ceiling, the calculateUserAccountData() should track this with a boolean that is then returned as an additional parameter. In validateWithdraw() protocol-v2/ValidationLogic.sol at 3782bfda1a9d0c9fa4c1bd26e69f1f3b3eed88ce · aave/protocol-v2 · GitHub, it’s possible to add a require: if the calculateUserAccountData() returns that the user deposited assets that hit the exposure ceiling and the asset the user is trying to withdraw hasn’t reached it yet, the tx reverts.
I expect this implementation to add around 2-3k gas per user deposited currency on calculateUserAccountData() (so if the user has 10 different collaterals any borrow/withdrawal would cost 20-30k gas more), and likely another 5K gas flat on withdraw.",45,134.0,2021-01-18
['Brainstorming: Exposure ceiling'],"This seems like a very well thought out implementation of the exposure ceiling feature. I cannot see any drawbacks to the implementation other than the additional gas costs required which seem like a worthwhile tradeoff given the added safety and UX improvements.
That said, the main drawback I see with supply caps more generally is that they don’t take into account the value of the assets deposited. For instance, a supply cap doesn’t seem to fully protect against P+D attacks since the value of the asset would increase (potentially by orders of magnitude) and permit additional borrowing even without any new supply being added to the market.
This is solved by implementing an exposure cap denominated in USD. I would be curious to hear how this would be done technically and what the potential tradeoffs are.",34,21.8,2021-01-22
['Brainstorming: Exposure ceiling'],"While this mechanism is a good way of avoiding recursive lending and other adversarial borrower behavior, we think there are a few nuances that appear to make this tricky to implement. Firstly, borrowers who are near liquidation accounts (e.g. need re-up deposits to count towards “debt ceiling” even if collateral ceiling is hit) will need to be able to save their positions. While this is mentioned in the article, we have observed it to be a key safety mechanic during times of duress. Proper implementation of this mechanic is therefore systemically important.
The current implementation of liquidationCall checks healthFactor  through calculateUserAccountDataVars. This iterates through each reserve and calculates totalCollateralBalanceEth by multiplying the token quantity by the reserve collateral’s base LTV (which would be the same for all accounts). With the exposure ceiling, this would need to be changed, and the total increase in computational load seems non-trivial as it would require extra state per account (e.g. there will be a large gas increase).

“Example: An user has 50 ETH worth of collateral, 25ETH worth of Asset 1(LTV 75%) and 25ETH worth of asset 2(LTV 50%). The average ltv of the user is 62.5%
If we introduce these changes, supposing the asset 2 goes past the exposure ceiling, the user still has 50ETH worth of collateral, but his ltv is now 37.5% ((0.75+0)/2). Which is the equivalent of having 25 ETH worth of collateral with LTV 75%.”

When total deposits of asset X hit their debt ceiling value DebtCeiling[X], LTV of future deposits of X will be 0. You also want to make sure that it applies on FUTURE deposits, not current ones. In the example Emilio gives above, it doesn’t matter if the avgLiquidationThreshold is unchanged as the new drop in totalCollateralInETH would lead to accounts immediately being liquidatable.
Perhaps having a rolling maxNetSupplyChange value that checks on deposit whether or not the total deposit amount reaches this value (this value can be kept very high for stablecoins such that users are always allowed to deposit). The idea is that the collateral assets for which this debt ceiling is useful will probably have very low utilization. Not allowing users to deposit more would force them to deposit a different collateral which helps mitigate the exposure to the asset as well as decrease calculation overhead on user withdraws, repays, etc.",32,61.4,2021-01-27
['Brainstorming: Exposure ceiling'],"Hey @wfu thanks for digging into it.
Actually the calculateHealthFactor uses the liquidationThreshold and not the LTV to calculate the health of the user position (protocol-v2/GenericLogic.sol at 09d084eeb09adf58db66fed5c3972fb0dda9b395 · aave/protocol-v2 · GitHub) and the function calculateHealthFactorFromBalances protocol-v2/GenericLogic.sol at 09d084eeb09adf58db66fed5c3972fb0dda9b395 · aave/protocol-v2 · GitHub.
This means that dropping the LTV does not affect the health factor of existing users.
The borrow function, on the other hand, calculates the borrowing power using the LTV (protocol-v2/ValidationLogic.sol at 09d084eeb09adf58db66fed5c3972fb0dda9b395 · aave/protocol-v2 · GitHub).
Which means that any individual asset with LTV = 0 will not participate in the borrowing power of the user. But if the asset had maintenance margin (liq threshold) and was used to borrow before, its collateralization capabilities are unchanged. This is actually the exact reason why we decided to split ltv and liquidation threshold in Aave V1",32,11.4,2021-01-27

['Gauntlet’s Market Risk Assessment'],"Recently, we published a formal analysis of the financial risk to participants in the Aave V1 and V2 protocols. The report expounds on methodology minutiae and specific results of our research. This post should serve as a TLDR and also give members of the community an opportunity to give feedback and suggestions about other market risk implications to the Aave protocol.
Background
At the time of writing, Aave has over $7, $8, $10 billion in TVL (thanks @Anjan-ParaFi!). With growth of this scale, mitigating financial and market risks is increasingly important as billions in customer funds are on the line.
Within decentralized finance (DeFi), borrowing protocols have four main risk factors:

Security risk
Governance risk
Oracle risk
Market risk

This post will focus on market risk, but we discuss how the Aave protocol addresses each of the other risk factors in our formal report.
Defining Market Risks
There are four primary sources of market risk within the protocol:

Extreme downward price movement: Shocks to market prices of collateral that cause the contract to become insolvent due to under-collateralization
Asset illiquidity and liquidator inaction: Loss of liquidity in an external market place, leading to a liquidator being disincentivized to liquidate defaulted collateral
Cascading liquidations: liquidations lower external market prices which in turn lead to further liquidations (i.e. a deflationary spiral)
Slashing of the safety module: Insolvency of the safety module due to extreme events where multiple collateral types concurrently fail to be liquidated

How do we test if the Aave protocol can be resilient to each of these market risks? Simulated stress tests!
Simulated Stress Tests
The main tool that we use to perform simulation-based stress tests on Aave’s Ethereum smart contracts is agent-based simulation (ABS). ABS has been used in a variety of stress test contexts, including to estimating censorship in cryptocurrency protocols, detecting fraudulent trading activity in CFTC exchanges,and stress testing frameworks from the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve. These simulations, while powerful, can be difficult to make both useful and accurate as model complexity can make it hard to match experimental results. Careful design, tuning, and infrastructure architecture can help avoid these pitfalls and has made ABS invaluable in industries such as algorithmic trading and self-driving car deployment.
Please take a look at our report to learn more about our simulation environment!
Many elements of our simulation are designed to study the aforementioned market risks.
Extreme downward price movement
We use a multi-asset correlated Geometric Brownian motion (GBM) to simulate price trajectories. The two most important aspects of this model are asset volatility and asset correlation. In order to properly simulate market capitulation and extreme price drops, we train models on historical data with various volatility regimes. Below is the price of ETH on Black Thursday with the cumulative liquidation value on the Aave V1 protocol. Both the price path and the delay in liquidations are key inputs to our simulation.

1496×1000

With the abundance of cryptoassets available on the Aave protocol, it is important to quantify and understand asset correlation, which can give insight into possible contagion and correlated liquidation and insolvency risk. These are the correlation matrices for Aave V2 in March 2021 (Top) and Aave V1 in January 2021 (bottom).

1600×1529


817×773

Asset illiquidity and liquidator inaction
Asset illiquidity can lead to liquidator inaction because the liquidator will need to give up large amounts of profit to trade out of collateral and borrow asset positions. Below is a visualization of optimal liquidator trade sizing with respect to expected slippage in different volatilities and order sizes.

1008×650

In addition, extreme network congestion will also lead to liquidator inaction. In order to simulate gas congestion and transaction delay, we construct modified and truncated normal distributions from 3 month trailing gas price data. At each time step in the simulation, we sample from the probability distribution to define the liquidator behavior.
As we increase ETH volatility in our simulations, we also increase the mean, standard deviation, and skew of the gas price distribution. Below are the daily gas percentile curves for February 2021 and generated gas curves.

1600×887

1440×720

Cascading liquidations
The deflationary spiral that can occur as a result of large liquidations is reproduced in our simulation by training market impact models. These models are trained on order-book (for centralized exchanges) and AMM (for decentralized exchanges) data. After a trade occurs (i.e. selling of liquidated collateral), we capture the impact that it has in the short-term and long-term.
Two factors that can affect the market impact are asset volatility and the size of the trades. We define the scaled liquidity of an asset as the average daily traded volume of the asset divided by the total collateral on the protocol. This is a snapshot of the market characteristics of each of the assets on Aave V2 in March 2021. 
1600×1173

Slashing of the safety module
The Aave protocol has a safety module denominated in the native AAVE token which serves as a backstop for protocol insolvency. Yield seeking investors can purchase AAVE, stake (lock) it within an insurance pool, and earn a pro-rata portion of AAVE rewards (currently 550 AAVE per day).
If an Aave market reaches a state where its liabilities (outstanding liens) are greater than its assets (collateral), then the AAVE safety module covers the shortfall of all markets voted by the community.
Our assumptions for safety module slashing are very conservative: we only consider the staked Aave safety module and do not use the liquidity provided by the 80/20 Balancer pool. In addition, we make the assumption that most centralized liquidity will disappear in a slashing event. In simulation, whenever there is an insolvency on the protocol, we sell Aave into the market and model the impact with only DEX liquidity.
Metrics
We will first define metrics that will help us answer these questions in a quantitative manner.

Insolvent account: Any account where the total borrow value in USD is larger than the total collateral value in USD.
Net insolvent value: When looking at a single account, this is the net insolvent value of the account at the end of a simulation run divided by the total collateral value of the account at the beginning of the run. When looking at the entire protocol, this is the sum of the net insolvent value of all accounts divided by the total collateral value of all accounts.
Net insolvent value percentage: When looking at the entire protocol, this is the sum of the net insolvent value of all accounts divided by the total collateral value of all accounts.
Asset net insolvent value percentage: This is the sum of net insolvent value divided by the total collateral value pro-rata supply percentage for all accounts that supply a given asset as collateral. Because of the many-to-many nature of collateral and borrowed assets on the Aave protocol, attributing insolvency statistics to specific assets can be convoluted.
Slashing run percentage: This is the percentage of simulation runs that end with greater than 1% of the total value (in Aave) of the safety module slashed to cover insolvencies and with greater than 10% drop in total value (in USD) of the safety module.

Results
Our baseline results for almost 6000 simulation runs showed that the protocol is resilient based on our metrics (<1% net insolvent value percentage of the entire protocol and <5% net insolvent value percentage of every asset). The graphs below show the percentage of users who will have any insolvency and the net insolvent value percentage of each asset in our initial simulation runs.

1008×1008

1008×1008

The initial simulation runs also serve to identify which assets’ parameters could have the largest impact on the health of the protocol. We chose YFI to study the impacts of various borrow parameters and liquidation parameters. Below is a graph of YFI asset net insolvent value percentage as a function of correlated asset volatility and loan-to-value ratio. Note that the insolvent value percentage is monotonic in both loan-to-value and volatility scalar, as one intuitively expects.

1590×1375

Next is a graph of YFI asset net insolvent value percentage as a function of correlated asset volatility and liquidation threshold. Note that the choice of liquidation threshold is only important at high enough volatilities: at low volatilities, changes to the threshold do little to change net insolvent value.

1594×1379

This is a graph of YFI asset net insolvent value percentage as a function of correlated asset volatility and liquidation bonus. Note that this measures the likelihood of correlated cascades (e.g. the y-axis is the volatility of an asset highly correlated to YFI with different liquidity levels). This figure illustrates that correlated assets admit a `safe region’ in terms of liquidation bonus where net insolvent value stays relatively low. Unlike the previous figure, we see that there is a much stronger dependence on liquidation threshold even at lower volatility scalars.

1555×1379

This is the total collateralization of the Aave protocol as a function of correlated asset volatility and liquidation bonus. Note that the total collateralization ratio of the system is inversely related to the net insolvency value at high volatility levels when the liquidation bonus is above 115%.

1600×1304

Finally, this is the percentage of simulation runs that ended with significant slashing (>1% Safety Module sold and >10% decrease in USD value). Note that we only observe significant slashing at high liquidation bonus and volatilities and that there is a `safe region’ of moderately sized liquidation bonuses.

1599×1386

In section 6.3.1 of the formal report, we give a more mathematical explanation for why the liquidation bonus has this relationship with protocol safety.
Conclusions
In this report we conducted a market-risk assessment of the Aave protocol via agent-based simulations run against the Aave contracts.
We stress-tested the liquidation mechanism under a wide range of market volatility and sizing scenarios to ensure that the protocol can prevent borrowers from becoming under-collateralized in most of these cases.
We also used historical market data from centralized and decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges to ensure that assumptions about volatility and slippage are representative of real-world conditions.
We found that the protocol can withstand aggressive borrowing parameters even in extreme asset volatility and network congestion situations. However, variations in the liquidation bonuses of the protocol lead to more drastic and unexpected results, and liquidation bonus should not be the primary tool used to adjust protocol-wide market risk.
We also studied the relationship between borrower behavior as a result of borrowing parameter adjustments to understand the returns of both AAVE holders and lenders on the Aave protocol as a result of parameter changes. As market conditions change,
the optimal parameters and suggestions will need to dynamically shift as well.
Our results suggest that monitoring and adjustment of protocol parameters is crucial for reducing risk to lenders and slashing in the safety module.
The community can expect us to be more active going forward with parameter suggestions and liquidation analysis in the near future!",38,567.6,2021-04-27
['Gauntlet’s Market Risk Assessment'],"I have read through the report from Gauntlet and I must commend them on the work that they have done. Clearly it is a good start in assessing one part of the risks that Aave is exposed to. I also see that there has been tremendous and impressive work by the Risk Community in Aave. I have read what I have been able to find in this risk documentation and other areas. It is clear that this is a topic genuinely considered and taken seriously.
I do have some questions about the overall risks and it would be really helpful if someone knows the answers. I am from a background in money and risk (I am an actuary) but I am fairly new to Blockchain so I am sorry if I am asking anything silly.


Is there an overall Aave Risk Register that records the risks that have been identified with their likely occurrence and impact and the approach taken to mitigate, avoid, accept or transfer? Both in terms of the protocol and our customers.


The report lists four categories of risk: Security risk, Governance risk, Oracle risk, and Market risk and others are mentioned elsewhere. But are there others that are not covered by these categories? For example Regulatory risk, Reputation risk (both for Aave and for Crypto in general), Ethical risk, Operational risk, etc. I can also see other categories have been considered by the Risk Community too. Has any work been done to create a list of all the risk categories and thought given to how to manage the categories?


What levers have been identified for controlling risks? Are these documented and who has control over them? What is the consensus mechanism for moving these levers?


Is the Gauntlet software open source so that others can check their findings and perform peer reviews on their results? Using open source software tools encourages decentralization and promotes trust.


There are types of risks borne by customers that are not borne by Aave for example Insurance Risk if they stake in the Insurance Pool. Should we consider if we have a duty of care towards customers to identify, manage, and communicate these risk and if so how do we approach their risks? For example has there been any modelling to understand the expected Insurance Pool return? How much do returns vary? Is this positive in the long-run? If so do we know what this is and should it be communicated to customers? If it is negative what needs to change? What is the probability of large losses? Do customers understand what they are investing into and can they cope with possible losses?


Does the Aave Community know what its acceptable risk tolerances are both in terms of the Protocol and in terms of customer outcomes? What level of liquidations in terms of numbers and amounts, over say a one year time horizon is acceptable? Has this been communicated to customers so they know what risk they are taking on? There seems to be focus on ensuring the protocol survives – which is obviously a good outcome and completely the right place to start. But it is kind of the minimum to achieve as a foundation.


Has any consideration been given to varying the Risk Thresholds by size of the customer’s deposit? Perhaps it should start high and reduce as the size of the deposit increases?


Has any thought been given to vulnerable customers? For example people who are in difficult personal circumstances and or who do not know what they are doing and could lose money that they need. Or customers who may suffer from personal, mental or addiction issues? Is Aave producing good outcomes for these customers and their families?


Thank you very much for taking time to read my questions and hopefully there are answers to at least some of them. There has been a lot of impressive work by the Aave Risk Community and it is clear that you take this area seriously and want to provide good outcomes. I am more than willing to help with finding answers if needed and if there is any scope to do so.",23,54.6,2021-05-30

Within the correlation analysis, did you take into account the shift higher in correlation that typically occurs with periods of heightened market volatility?


In the report, you used correlation metrics and trailing volatility to estimate the price trajectories for assets that were either not liquid or not created during the historical Black Thursday market event. Given new information from the most recent drawdown we just had, did the assets you simulated in this way line up with what actually occurred?


In the conclusion of the report, you suggested that ongoing monitoring/adjustment of protocol parameters is crucial for reducing risk. Have you considered what an appropriate program or methodology for monitoring and adjustment would look like? What guardrails or triggers would you suggest putting in place to ensure that we are optimizing parameters during periods of high volatility/increased correlation?

['Poll Sentiment: Double AAVE Token Utility: Protocol AND BORROWER Protection'],"Right now, the AAVE token can be staked and it serves as backend insurance for the protocol. It provides utility to the protocol, but not to the borrower.
What if it didn’t have to be that way? What if it could provide protection to the protocol while also providing protection to the borrower ?
Proposal to allow staked AAVE to be activated as liquidation protection:
Allow users to opt in to using staked AAVE as liquidation protection:
In the event that a user’s health factor falls below 1, approve up to X% (TBD) of the collateral value to be used as liquidation protection. In the event that the health factor falls below 1 even with the added collateral value, the staked AAVE is slashed and taken by the treasury as part of the liquidation.
This could even have the long term potential of adding to yield for stakers if, for example, any slashed staked AAVE from liquidation protection were distributed as part of ongoing yield for stakers vs. just from the existing treasury.
If this is a conceptual direction that people like, I wouldn’t mind a risk assessment from someone with expertise in that area, but wanted to gauge interest in this both from a borrower / staker standpoint.
My thoughts are if it is “opt-in” it’s not really that relevant to the borrower even if they don’t like it because they can simply use the platform as they have been. The stakers I would imagine would enjoy the potential for extra (potentially sustainable) yield / dividend.
I’m interested to hear thoughts on risk / desirability from a protocol standpoint. If the concept is generally agreeable, a deeper dive on what level of protection (vs collateral) is best from a risk lens and if this is feasible within the existing contracts would definitely be needed.

['ARC: Add Support for RAI'],"ARC: Add support for RAI

Summary
Reflexer Labs has designed a new type of stable asset RAI, a self-stabilizing asset backed credit facility. This proposal aims to introduce RAI to the Aave community and propose RAI’s addition to Aave Money Markets.

Background on RAI and Stable Credit Facilities
After its launch in February, over $100m worth of RAI has been minted and more than $300M worth of ETH have been deposited in the protocol. RAI has managed to stabilize using its on-chain PID controller and is now undergoing a governance minimization process with the intention to harden the protocol.
 DeFi Lego

Fork of MakerDAO’s Multi-Collateral DAI (MCD)
Governance-Minimized in the Long Run
Algorithmic (PID) interest rates

Self-stabilizing asset-backed credit facility

Like MakerDAO, users can unlock credit from their ETH
Unlike MakerDAO, debt/credit is not fixed at $1. Rather, it fluctuates based on supply and demand.
RAI’s PI controller updates the system’s moving peg to balance demand for debt vs. credit

 Reserve asset for DeFi, alternative to “stablecoins”

More decentralized than dollar coins like USDC & USDT
Independent of USD inflationary monetary policy
Avoids being targeted by dollar coin regulation like the “Stable Act”
Backed by pure ETH, no centralized collateral.


Motivation
Introducing more trustless, stable assets into Aave money markets will benefit both Aave and the ecosystem as a whole. The addition of RAI will diversify the protocol’s exposure to stable assets beyond traditional dollar-pegged stablecoins and provide enough bandwidth to grow the protocols TVL.
Currently, $670m (~75%) of the stable asset liquidity on Aave is centralised (USDC, USDT, TUSD, BUSD, GUSD) while only $166m (~25%) is decentralised (DAI, sUSD). While this isn’t inherently a negative, introducing more decentralised, stable assets adds to Aave’s composability and resilience.
RAI also stands to benefit from being able to expand its utility and liquidity across the largest lending protocol in the space, allowing for more experimentation to occur in the ongoing journey towards entirely trustless and decentralized stable-credit.

Benefits to Aave Community
The Aave community would benefit from adding RAI as a collateral asset in several ways:

Increased stable asset liquidity and protocol TVL in general
Introduction of more decentralised, non-dollar pegged stable assets to the Aave protocol
An expansion of the Aave community, introducing the Reflexer & RAI communities to Aave, growing a stronger commnuity.


TL;DR
Add RAI to Aave’s Money Markets in order to expand the protocol’s decentralised stable asset offering.

Specifications
1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?
_  (Fire Eyes DAO) is working alongside the Reflexer team to communicate and coordinate this integration. _  is a DAO navigating token economic and governance systems across the DeFi ecosystem (including Aave!).
2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token
RAI is a decentralized non-pegged ETH-back stable asset meant to act as pristine collateral in DeFi.
3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?
Other stablecoins are either centralized or pegged to the dollar. RAI is neither of those and aligns perfectly with the ethos of trust-minimized finance.
4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are the live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?
RAI launched in February and has amassed over $100M in liquidity with $300M in value locked. RAI is governance minimised by design, as well as currently moving towards a grants DAO.
5.How is the asset currently used?
RAI is currently used as a trust-minmized alternative to other stablecoins. The goal is to drive adoption of RAI to be used as collateral in money markets, other synthetic assets, and more.
6. Emission schedule
There is no emission schedule. Similar to DAI, RAI minted on demand when users lock ETH into the protocol.
7. Token & protocol permissions and upgradability
Right now the protocol is almost fully upgradeable. This includes anything from oracles, the contract that collects stability fees, the contract that liquidates positions, the one that auctions collateral etc. This is managed through a multisig with a 6 hour delay on any governance action. Managed by the Reflexer core team. The multisig manages the full system and will do so until rai is gov minimized.
On the other hand, the contract that keeps track of debt and collateral in all Safes (CDPs) cannot be upgraded.
8. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)

Market Cap: $100M
24h Volume: $10M
Volatility: Very Low
Maturity: Early-Mid

9. Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)
10K followers on Twitter, 5K members on Discord, Github is highly active.
10. Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens

Date of Deployment: February 13th, 2021
Number of Transactions: 40,000+
Number of Holders: 2,000+

['Listing Proposal: Add BZRX (bZx Protocol Token)'],"Listing Proposal of BZRX on AAVE
Summary: Listing BZRX token on AAVE
Hello AAVE family,
We are the bZx team and would like to propose AAVEngers to support the listing of our token, BZRX, on AAVE’s platform as a collateral asset. We believe having BZRX on AAVE would open up several exciting opportunities for both BZX and AAVE.
bZx’s presence on AAVE would provide additional TVL to AAVE and an opportunity to earn additional fees as bZx holders would be able to come to AAVE to collateralize their assets.
The reason bZx’s presence on AAVE will attract more users to the platform is because bZx is one of the original pioneering protocols in the Defi space. Over the years, bZx has established a strong and loyal community that believes in the principles of DeFi and who would love to be able to use the AAVE platform to collateralize their assets.
About bZx Protocol
bZx is a protocol for tokenized margin trading and lending. It is a financial primitive for shorting, leverage, borrowing, and lending that empowers decentralized, efficient, and rent-free blockchain applications.
bZx Protocol allows anyone to build applications that enable lenders, borrowers, and traders with the most flexible decentralized finance protocol on Ethereum.
Products built with bZx
Fulcrum: fulcrum.trade
Torque: torque.loans
Token Economics
The bZx Protocol is an Ethereum based lending and margin trading platform that differentiates itself by following a three token strategy iTokens, pTokens, and BZRX tokens. While it continues to use three tokens, BZRX is its primary token, and the bZx Protocol is also designed to use the same.
iTokens and pTokens
iTokens and pTokens are powerful financial primitives. iTokens are tokens that continuously increase in value from earning interest, while pTokens represent short and leveraged positions. These iTokens and pTokens can be composed into novel financial products, used as collateral for loans, or listed on any exchanges to enable margin lending and trading instantly.
bZx Protocol (BZRX) Token
BZRX, being the primary token of the Protocol,  will be used for voting on governance decisions on the future direction of the Protocol. There is also a function–also not yet activated–to give BZRX token holders rights to the bZx insurance fund. The insurance fund comprises 10% of the interest earned by lenders–taken as part of the smart contract’s design. The insurance fund protects lenders in case borrowers become unable to pay back their loans.
Growing DeFi and BZRX
The decentralized finance ecosystem has become progressively more active and experimental, culminating in various token economic incentives for activity and governance.
The new BZRX token functions as a vote in the bZxDAO, the first trias politics model of dApp governance. Complex protocols that cannot be governance-minimized require sophisticated checks and balances to ensure the protocol upgrades can proceed safely while also safeguarding critical protocol parameters. In the proposed BZRX Token Model v3, fee sharing is paired with governance to incentivize participation and align incentives.
Technical Considerations
BZRX has an active Chainlink ETH pricefeed with 16 data sources, which can be utilized to price the market on Aave, making listing BZRX a breeze.

['The Maker Direct Deposit Dai Module (D3M)'],"Greetings Aave! Sam from the MakerDAO smart contracts team here. I am pleased to introduce the proposed Maker Direct Deposit Dai Module (D3M) in cooperation with the Aave team. This module will allow the Maker protocol to enforce a maximum variable borrow rate for the DAI market on Aave. It does this by calculating how much DAI supply is required to drop the interest rate down to the desired level and then minting that amount against the returned aDAI. All of this is performed by a fully automated vault with a target interest rate specified by Maker governance.
Why is this useful?
As I’m sure you all know, one of the biggest problems for Aave’s users is the unpredictability of the stablecoin borrow rate. Due to the volatile nature of DeFi, the interest rates can surge to double digits and remain there for weeks. By enforcing a maximum borrow rate, users will be able to take on leverage without fear of being stuck paying high interest rates. In exchange, Maker will be able to earn interest on the demand surges.
How this works
The D3M is deployed like a special aDAI vault with a specific target borrow interest rate - say 4%. Whenever the variable borrow rate on Aave DAI goes above 4% anyone can call the vault’s exec() function to re-adjust the amount of DAI in the pool. In this case it will calculate the amount of DAI needed to be minted to hit the target interest rate and put that into the Aave’s lending pool. This will continue to add DAI until either the debt ceiling is reached or the 4% target is hit.

direct-deposit2780×1373 83.3 KB

In the reverse direction, when the variable borrow is under 4% and we have previously added liquidity, the exec() function will calculate how much liquidity to remove to bring the target interest rate back up to 4%. It will continue to remove liquidity until either the vault debt is fully paid back or the pool runs out of liquidity. In the event the pool runs out of DAI liquidity the module will wait until it fills up again and continue to unwind.
To the end user this will all be performed in the background. They will just magically get the benefit of predictable interest rates.
Code
For the technically inclined, I have submitted a Maker Improvement Proposal (MIP) for inclusion in May’s governance cycle. You can read about the MIPs process here.
Aave / Maker Alignment
Beyond the immediate benefit of having a stable borrow rate, I feel this is a great first step for both protocols to join together in future collaboration. Aave and Maker are currently dominating their respective market segments. By joining together we can become an unstoppable force securing the future of DeFi. I invite you all to join us over on the Maker forum.",59,1121.6,2021-04-07
['The Maker Direct Deposit Dai Module (D3M)'],"I support the idea of D3M and posted the specifications in the MakerDAO forum. The idea behind D3M in short is that D3M is a Vault in MakerDAO that allows to mint DAI directly to Aave Protocol and hold aDAI as a collateral in the D3M Vault.
Essentially this means that DAI liquidity shortages in Aave Protocol could be covered by D3M Vault across different Aave markets including the cross-chain markets such as Polygon - where supply of DAI is critical for the adoption of Aave Protocol in these new markets.
The beauty of the D3M is that the Vault simply acts as amongst one of the depositors and the amount D3M supplies is based on MakerDAO governance and based on the MakerDAO community risk assessment over Aave Protocol meaning that risk-averse culture both in Aave and Maker would increase the liquidity and adoption both for Dai and Aave Protocol. The better Aave community handles risk (and Maker community assess risk), the more liquidity can be obtained from D3M over the long run.
Bringing Aave and Maker community is a win-win for DeFi adoption on Ethereum and L2s where lot of usage will be in the future. D3M is the first initiative to strengthen these two communities closer together to ensure strategic upside in highly innovative space.",51,180.0,2021-04-07

['The Maker Direct Deposit Dai Module (D3M)'],"Thanks for the reply!
A few moments ago I realized that as well; so basically DAI is collateralised by the assets that people provided as collateral to Aave. Under the assumption that all collateral assets have perfectly working liquidation mechanisms and if we ignore platform risks (bugs etc.) then what Aave does is essentially a risk-free operation, right? Thus, someone should fund all of these borrowing activities to make a small fee. So far Aave relied on private individuals to provide stable coins (relatively inefficient and volatile) and will now use Maker to do that automatically. Is that correct?
This is actually absolutely huge, isn’t it? I mean Aave would always have low and predictable rates for borrowers that only reflect the risk of bugs or issues related to liquidations. Is that correct?
It would mean that Aave has already solved the “stablecoin deposits” part of the equation as a platform. And could continue to work on use cases that make borrowing more attractive.
Is that a correct assessment?
I was also wondering why there is such a strong inflow of DAI to Aave recently? Does it have anything to do with this?

It would mean that Aave has already solved the “stablecoin deposits” part of the equation as a platform. And could continue to work on use cases that make borrowing more attractive.


I think it’s pretty huge. Aave can get predictable rates and Maker can get additional Dai supply earning interest. It’s a win-win.



 Vlad:

I was also wondering why there is such a strong inflow of DAI to Aave recently? Does it have anything to do with this?


Probably the stkAAAVE liquidity mining.

Thank you very much for the help!

['ARC: Aave Community Grants Program'],"Co-authored with Shreyas Hariharan (@HelloShreyas)
UPDATE – May 28, 2021
The proposal was ratified on-chain earlier this month, the grants DAO has been funded and we’ve started receiving applications.
Proposal: Aave - Open Source Liquidity Protocol
Aave Grants DAO home page and application portal: https://aavegrants.org/
UPDATE – April 20, 2021
Nick Cannon (@inkyamze) and Calvin Chu (@calchulus) have agreed to join the committee as the last two reviewers! We were thrilled to receive a lot of interest in helping out and will be mindful of who applied and try to loop them in to contribute where possible.

Summary
We want to start a community-led grants program to fund ideas submitted by the Aave protocol’s community, with a focus on empowering a wider network of community developers. We would like to share our proposal and receive feedback from the community.
ARC Rationale
Aave has an ecosystem reserve of ~$1.1B or ~3m AAVE as of 4/9/21, which is available to fund growth and community initiatives, part of which could be used to fund grants. However, it is currently not easy for the community to allocate from the reserve to fund proposals.
To promote inclusivity and a more visible and transparent avenue for funding development in the Aave ecosystem, while maintaining the decentralized nature of the ecosystem, we propose a community-led grants program. We are still looking for a good name (if you have fun suggestions in the spirit of Aave, please suggest it!), but for the purpose of this ARC, we’ll refer to it as Aave Grants Program or AGP.
The goal of the program is to provide resources to grow the Aave ecosystem in a way that can scale over time. There are many great ideas for improving the Aave protocol bubbling up in the Discord, community forum and other places. We hope to initiate a community-led, transparent process for connecting those developers/creators/innovators with resources needed to go from idea to funded development.
Given the difficulty of decentralizing grants administration, we propose establishing a committee which has the power to administer grants on a discretionary basis. The focus will be on disbursing grant funding effectively and quickly to individuals and teams working to improve the Aave ecosystem.
Proposal Description
Our proposal is inspired by the Compound and Uniswap grants programs, which have both received approvals to deploy $1m and $750k per quarter, respectively.
We propose to run the pilot grants program over two quarters. We request a max grants budget of $2m and a max operating budget of $250k. The operating budget will be used to pay the lead, reviewers, lawyer, and other administrative costs to set up the grants program.
There will be two types of grants that the grants committee can approve:

Rapid grants: <$100k

Simple process to apply for a grant to AGP
Grant decision expected within 10 days


Community grants: $100k-$500k

Applicants post a proposal on Aave’s governance forum
Based on feedback and discussion, the committee can decide to approve these grants



Contributors can also seek grants over $500k but they will not go through the committee. They will have to be posted on Aave’s governance forum and approved through an on-chain vote.
The expenses will be priced in USD terms at the beginning of each quarter. The reviewers will ensure that all unspent funds will be returned to the Ecosystem Reserve at the conclusion of the pilot. If the program is underfunded because AAVE’s token price falls significantly, the committee may request the underfunded amount from governance. After running the pilot program for two quarters, the community can vote to continue, modify, or discontinue the program.
Applications will be reviewed and funded on a rolling basis. The applications approved and funded within each quarter will form a funding round which will be tracked, supported and documented.
Documentation of results will be made available to the community at the end of each round, at which point we will solicit feedback from the community. The idea is to start with a rough MVP and evolve through community feedback. We expect to learn a lot about how to do this right in the first 2 quarters and anticipate making changes to the grants program over time through subsequent proposals.
Committee Members
We propose a committee of 8 members: 1 lead and 7 reviewers. The lead will be the organizational backbone of the program and ensure that things move smoothly and efficiently. The lead will likely dedicate a significant amount of time to the program.
Reviewers will process applications, ensure that the lead is acting in good faith and is effective in their role, and will operate a 4 of 7 multisig which disburses funds to grantees. The reviewers will also hold the program accountable to its goals and objectives and return any excess funds to the Aave Ecosystem Reserve. Reviewers are likely to dedicate a smaller amount of time to the program.
Both the lead and the reviewers will serve for a period of two quarters. After two quarters, the grants program and the committee member positions will be up for renewal. This will be put up on the governance forum for a discussion and subsequent on-chain vote.
Members may be replaced during the pilot program, for example, if they find they are not able to dedicate sufficient time to the program. We aim to be as transparent as possible and get feedback on the Aave forum if there are any changes to the committee during the program.
We’ve had some initial discussions with people who have expressed interest in helping and have added 5 reviewers so far (in addition to Shreyas, who will be the lead). We have two open reviewer slots for the committee. If you are interested in being a reviewer, please reply to this thread with your interest with some basic info on yourself, including:

Describe your involvement in the Aave ecosystem
What skills/experience do you bring to the committee?
Can you commit ~5 hours a week?

We would love to have more members on board committed to growing the Aave ecosystem! The committee so far is composed as follows:
Lead: Shreyas Hariharan - Llama
Shreyas is the founder of Llama, which helps DeFi protocols and DAOs manage their treasury. He has actively worked on treasury spending, allocation, and reporting. He is working on a treasury strategy for Uniswap and serving as a reviewer for Uniswap grants. As an Aave community member and token holder, he is excited to help grow the Aave ecosystem through the grants program.
Reviewers:


Aleks Larsen - Blockchain Capital

Jose Maria Macedo - Delphi Digital

Imran Khan - DeFi Alliance

Maggie Love - SheFi

Corbin Page - ConsenSys Codefi

Nick Cannon - Gauntlet

Calvin Chu - Independent

Budget
We request a max grants budget of $2m to distribute grants and a max operating budget of $250k over two quarters to pay the lead, reviewers, lawyer, and other administrative costs to set up the grants program. This will be funded by the Aave Ecosystem Reserve.
Payments to the lead will be approved by the reviewers and made at the end of every month (i.e., if the program begins on 4/20/21, the lead will be paid on 5/20/21, and the again on 6/20/21 and 7/20/21 based on hours worked). Payments to reviewers will also be made every month based on hours worked.
Any changes to the AGP including renewal of the program at the end of 2 quarters, total quarterly budget and committee compensation will require full quorum.
Committee Compensation
We suggest compensation for the lead roughly in line with the initial Uniswap and Compound proposals - $100/hr for a maximum of 40 hrs/week. This compensation will be allocated to the AGP multisig from the Aave Ecosystem Reserve as part of the overall funding for the program.
The time commitment for the reviewers is likely to be far lower. The compensation for reviewers will be $100/hr for a maximum of 5 hrs/week.
Priorities
To help inform the types of grants which are most likely to get funded, we highlight the following target areas:

Protocol development (including core Aave protocol development, development of higher layer protocols which use the Aave protocol)
Applications and integrations (front-ends and other applications that use the Aave protocol)
Developer tooling
Community (marketing and educational)
Committees, sub-committees, and DAOs that serve the Aave ecosystem
Code audits
Events and hackathons
Bounties

What does success look like?
We will evaluate the success of the program against the following criteria:
Measurable criteria:

Growth in the number of grants applications received quarter-over-quarter
Growth in the number of projects, ideas, and events funded
Growth in community engagement (e.g. increased activity on forums, Discord, etc.)
Growth in Aave pools driven by applications funded via grants (e.g. increased TVL, borrow activity, and unique addresses due to apps funded by grants)

Subjective criteria:

Improved sentiment and goodwill within the community
Improvement to the Aave protocol’s brand and positioning in the market

Timeline / Process
We will organize grant recipients into two 3-month funding rounds. Applications will be accepted on a rolling basis and any grants disbursed during a given 3-month period become part of the corresponding round. Round 1 will be for three months from the day the grants proposal has been approved. For example, if the proposal is approved on 4/21/2021, Round 1 of the grants program will be from 4/21/2021 to 7/21/2021 and Round 2 of the grants program will be from 7/22/2021 to 10/22/2021.
If approved, starting immediately after a proposal is ratified, AGP will begin accepting applications on a rolling basis. The grants committee will determine on how funding is to be disbursed (e.g. milestones, upfront, etc.) on a case-by-case basis. In general, the goal will be to align long-term incentives with the interests of the Aave community and AAVE holders.
At the end of each round, the committee is responsible for sharing all the grant recipients along with amounts and descriptions as part of a transparent quarterly review process. The end of the Round 2 marks the end of the pilot. At that point, the community will decide based on the results of the first two rounds whether or not to continue funding AGP (in the same or an amended form).
Most grants will have 1-2 milestones and recipients will receive about half the grant upfront and half on the completion of a milestone. For more complex projects or larger grants, there may be several milestones and payments could be split across these milestones. AGP will get progress updates from teams and assess the completion of these milestones. This ensures downside protection for the AGP in case the project is unsuccessful or needs to pivot.
The grants will primarily be focused on projects working to improve the Aave protocol. However, a small portion of the budget (5-10%) may be allocated to select projects with a wider scope (e.g. ETH scalability).
If AGP has distributed all grants but has more promising projects to fund, it can propose increasing the budget to governance. However, it is entirely up to the Aave community to vote on whether to increase the budget.
Conclusion
If feedback is positive, the AGP will move to a governance proposal and if ratified, will begin accepting applications for grants on a rolling basis shortly after its approval.
Should the pilot be successful, we could scale the program over time to accommodate more capital-intensive grants (including protocol work) so that it can ultimately become a primary engine of funding in the Aave ecosystem.
We are AAVE holders and are committed to the success of AGP and of the Aave protocol. However, this is an experiment. If it does not work, hopefully we’ll have learned how we can implement this better and can help others pursue alternative approaches.

['ARC: Aave Community Grants Program'],"This is a wonderful idea. The way you structured the Grant Program is super efficient and transparent.
I also salute the potential amount destined to the Program. This demonstrates a powerful engagement from the Aave protocol to empower external builders. This move worth thousands words.
While we are detailing solutions to promote external contributions to the Aave ecosystem, I would like to mention the Aave referral program that had been stop after migration from v1 to v2. Some projects will not get a grant from Aave while they already provide value to the ecosystem. I think they should be rewarded for that.",78,155.4,2021-04-15
['ARC: Aave Community Grants Program'],"This is an awesome idea and very well put together by @aleks-larsen and @HelloShreyas. I’m honoured to be part of the committee and serve this awesome community
As I expressed privately, I believe grants are a core tool in helping protocols scale their teams and BUIDL faster. At Delphi Ventures, we see a lot of projects that shouldn’t have a token but rather be built on top of existing protocols like Aave. However, there’s no scalable business model for developers wanting to contribute to protocols, especially considering the opportunity cost of skilled devs is starting their own projects or joining an early stage one and owning a lot of the supply.
I think a scaled up grants program could help achieve this goal by giving skilled buidlers a real alternative to starting their own project, with less upside of course but also less risk. In order to do this, grants need to be able to be larger and they also need to be programmable, including granular objective and subjective criteria (with subjective conditions being ratified by the grants committee). This kind of granularity makes it much easier for the community to dispense larger grants while knowing they’ll only have to dispense the entire amount if the team delivers. Grants could be provided for stuff like:
*building out Aave on another protocol
*building leveraged trading functionality on top of Aave
*building out a yield aggregator / yield farming product using Aave for leverage
etc etc
In order to minimize execution risk for these bigger grants, the grants could be vested over time based on specific milestones being achieved. These milestones would be verified by a tokenholder elected and accountable grants committee. For example: For a $1M grant, $200k could be released upfront, $200k upon delivery of product to test-net, $200k upon delivery to main-net and then $400k vesting linearly based on the team continuously maintaining the product (this could be cancelled via multi-sig vote if it was determined team wasn’t adequately maintaining the project)
This is obviously a longer-term vision but just wanted to put out there to get the community’s thoughts. Very bullish on the Aave Grants Program excited to see the current Grants Program in action and also to keep improving it over time :)",74,144.6,2021-04-15

We can assist with technical due diligence regarding integrations, ETLs, and data visualization. From the non-technical side, we have just initiated grant batch #2 from the Compound Grants Program and there have already been plenty of learnings that would be applicable to a similar program for Aave.

['ARC: Aave Community Grants Program'],"Hello everyone - my name is Nettra. Glad to be here and to see this!
This is such a great program and looks really well thought through.
My thoughts on this:

Aave is quickly becoming a household name, at least among the defi and blockchain-informed.
My aspiration is for decentralized, open-source protocols like Aave to fully enter the mainstream, to truly serve and enrich the lives of the mass ‘market’ but better since we know that decentralized finance is actually capable of serving those historically excluded from legacy institutions. In addition to bringing in underrepresented groups, I am also excited for Aave to touch underrepresented industries in this space. This means exploring how decentralized finance can touch industries that did not consider themselves to be financial industries, linked to art, culture, education.

I’d like to do my small part in this by participating in this reviewer group. I believe the reviewer group will do its job better if it includes diverse viewpoints along gender, geography, industry experience and expertise.
Here are some things about me that might address those points.

I identify as a woman, I grew up in Cambodia, a country where many are still unbanked and regulation around cryptocurrencies is still unclear.
I have lived and worked in the United States (California, Massachusetts, New York, Indiana), France, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.
I am also an artist and have sold art on OpenSea.
I have worked in technology for 10 years.

I have:

served as a mentor, judge and advisor to entrepreneurship programs and startups, including two crypto startups, one as early as 2017 [1]
managed a global entrepreneurship network for young changemakers - recruiting + community-building [2]
worked with VCs to improve their decision-making processes (conducting experiments, observing 7 consecutive months of investment committee meetings and analyzing five years of dealflow) - I would use this insight to design our decision-making process to be self-improving [3]
peer-reviewed research and symposia proposals for management, entrepreneurship and innovation journals and conferences such as eGov-CeDeM-ePart, Technology & Innovation Management (Academy of Management Division), Babson Entrepreneurship Research Conference, Academy of Management Review, Journal of Business Venturing [4]

My involvement with the Aave community:

I have deposited funds and borrowed on the Aave app
I speak about Aave in my weekly Clubhouse room Crypto Beyond Currency
I attend Aave’s Clubhouse events
I attend Aave’s weekly Zoom calls
I interact on Twitter
I am on the Discord

I would very much LOVE to work with the committee to design a process for us that would allow us to achieve our human goals and vision.
Four of them for me would be to:

help usher in a wave of applications for decentralized protocols
contribute to a zeitgeist shift of our rights around sharing in the profits, and being protected from the downsides (data ownership and protection) when we choose to interact with service providers
educate the wider public and developer community about what we can do with the cool aave infrastructure and services by funding co-designing events (including potentially research symposia around the new opportunities around protocol governance)
have fun and make good memes

Five hours a week is hard for me at the moment as I am a Business School lecturer and researcher and have other commitments. But I can start off with 10 hours per month and increase that to 20 hours per month. I also see my research and teaching focus shifting to becoming synergistic with this commitment.

Paragraph Summary
UMA has a strong and rapidly growing community focused on creating derivatives on ethereum for anyone to access anywhere. This proposal is to add UMA token as an asset on AAVE V2 for users to lend and borrow against.
Motivation
By lending and borrowing UMA on AAVE, it enables UMA tokenholders to collateralize their UMA tokens to gain exposure to other assets or to obtain more UMA and use it to continue to govern UMA protocol and increase their ability to provide price data to UMA’s optimistic oracle.
Specifications

What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?

I am an employee of Risk Labs which is an LLC setup on behalf of the UMA Foundation to grow UMA protocol.

Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token

UMA token is used to operate UMA’s optimistic oracle. Owning UMA gives you the ability to contribute price information to UMA’s Optimistic Oracle and govern UMA protocol (and receive rewards for doing so).
About UMA Protocol
UMA is an open-source protocol that provides the infrastructure for developers to create and manage decentralized financial products, like derivatives, on the Ethereum network that anyone can use, no matter where they live.
UMA enables developers to create synthetic assets via two core components:

Priceless financial contract templates
Optimistic oracle service

Together, these two components enable the creation of fast, efficient, and secure synthetic derivatives on the Ethereum blockchain.
UMA’s goal is in its name; Universal Market Access. Unlike traditional derivatives, UMA’s derivative contracts are self-governing and secured by UMA’s optimistic oracle.

Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?

UMA’s presence on AAVE would provide additional TVL to AAVE and an opportunity to earn additional fees as UMA holders would be able to come to AAVE to collateralize their assets.
UMA is a community-led protocol that enables anyone to easily create secure derivative products on Ethereum. UMA protocol has a current TVL of around $109 million.

Provide a brief history of the project and how it overcame stressed conditions

UMA currently secures around $109 million of money in contracts built ontop of UMA. UMA has never been compromised and is designed in a way that is very secure by minimizing oracle usage and ensuring the cost to corrupt UMA is always greater than the amount of money that can be stolen from it. View below for more information on the economic guarantees UMA provides for contracts built on top of it.



docs.umaproject.org



How UMA solves the Oracle Problem | UMA Docs
The DVM embraces the fact that any on-chain oracle can be corrupted — for a price.






How is the asset currently used?

UMA token is used to operate UMA’s optimistic oracle, known as the Data Verification Mechanism (DVM). Owning UMA gives you the ability to contribute price information to the DVM and govern UMA protocol.
The benefits of owning UMA include:


Earning rewards for voting on price requests from financial contracts using the DVM


Earning rewards for governing the UMA ecosystem by voting on parameter changes and approving system upgrades. System upgrades can include supporting new price identifiers or collateral types


Voters who participate and vote correctly earn an inflationary reward (currently 0.05% of total network token supply), distributed pro-rata by stake.


Emission schedule - UMA Token Release & Treasury Update | by Hart Lambur | UMA Project | Jan, 2021 | Medium


Token permissions and upgradability - UMA is governed by UMA tokenholders. All upgrades / changes are voted on by UMA tokenholders. Votes are aggregated by UMA’s Data Verification Mechanism (DVM) whereby it will then implement the proposed changes (if applicable).


Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)


UMA has a market cap of $1,477,703,740 and is listed on major centralized exchanges (Coinbase, Binance, Gemini, OKEx, Huobi, etc.,). The 24-hour volume on coinbase is over $11 million. View more here: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/uma#markets

['Proposal: Disable MKR borrowing'],"Hi Everyone,
Aaron from the MakerDAO community here. Recently we tried to enact staking rewards into the protocol in order to incentivize MKR holders to participate more and move their MKR from more speculative ventures but unfortunately MKR voters did not approve.
Another primary concern is that the way the protocol is set up, there is no lock mechanism nor staking incentive to ensure protocol safety, therefore it is possible that a large amount of MKR is loaned out for a borrower to come along and attack the system. Since Aave is the largest lender of MKR, this could pose an existential threat to the protocol.
Short/Medium term solution
With all that being said, I wanted to ask/propose whether the Aave community would be willing to consider disabling the ability to borrow MKR while leaving lending intact. This would still allow for flash loan and collateral revenues while also helping Maker out. As a side note, I notice from your analytics that not much revenue comes from MKR borrowing anyways. If for some reason this is unpalatable to you or your Risk team, I would be willing to present the MakerDAO community with a compensation proposal for this transaction. With our communities hopefully building a collaborative relationship in the future I hope that you will consider this proposal.
@LongForWisdom makes an additional good point below that disabling borrowing might actually bring Aave more business as MKR lenders would feel safer bringing their MKR over as collateral, thus borrowing other assets.
Should Aave disable MKR borrowing?

Next Steps

['Proposal: Disable MKR borrowing'],"In general i agree with this proposal, since it’s an important topic for one of the most relevant defi protocols on ethereum. I also think that most likely many MKR borrowers are afraid to provide liquidity to Aave and therefore borrow for this exact reason, which of course impacts borrow demand.
I have a question, if the community approves, what would your timeline for submitting the proposal be?
I’m asking because there is an important protocol update coming, that besides many other new features specifically designed for security, implements a borrow cap. The borrow cap would be a win-win for both Aave and Maker - it can be set right below the threshold that would be considered dangerous for the MKR governance, while still allowing the Aave protocol to earn MKR governance power. I voted abstain for now, until i understand what the timeline would be for this",58,116.6,2021-05-26

['Proposal: Disable MKR borrowing'],"Just wanted to follow up and express support for this from the Maker side.
I think most of those using Aave with MKR as collateral are using it to get credit to be used elsewhere in the ecosystem. I don’t believe that preventing MKR borrows would impact this usecase significantly, but it would help us all breathe a little easier on the Maker side.
A couple of notes:



 Emilio:

The borrow cap would be a win-win for both Aave and Maker - it can be set right below the threshold that would be considered dangerous for the MKR governance


The level that is dangerous for Maker can change unpredictably depending on the level of support on various executive votes. Furthermore, if Aave aims to set the borrow limit just under the safe value, any combination with other lending protocols could allow a malicious actor to borrow more MKR than the ‘safe’ value. Personally it would be fantastic to see the borrow cap set at 0, but I understand this may not be feasible for Aave.
On the other hand, if Aave did set the borrow limit to zero for MKR, we would be able to refer anyone that wanted credit on their MKR to Aave with confidence that it isn’t negatively affecting the security of the protocol, this may lead to additional borrow demand for Aave on other assets.
We currently have this situation where people ask ‘Can we borrow DAI on Maker using MKR’ to which the answer is no, as this has historically been deemed an unacceptable risk for the protocol. However, we are unable to refer them to a place where they can lever up on MKR safely - Aave could be this place, if it implemented a low-or-zero borrow limit on MKR.",37,32.4,2021-05-26
['Proposal: Disable MKR borrowing'],"Thanks @Aaron for the proposal. First and foremost, It’s good that MakerDAO and Aave communities are working together on solving topics that are important for both of the protocols. I think this an example how communities can be more inclusive and sets an example for the whole ecosystem.
For this particular topic, I think Maker’s system could be redesigned in a way where borrowing MKR would not create a threat to the Maker system since limiting borrowing MKR on Aave Protocol would not solve the issue, rather would drive more yield on lending out MKR in centralized platforms or OTC market where the borrowing market would go towards.
My suggestion is that the Maker community should consider on how to change the current system in a way that would mitigate the attacks on the Maker system. I agree also that the borrowing of MKR is not primary use-case at Aave, and there is even larger discussion on whether these tokens should be borrowed out, occasionally we see MKR borrow volumes increase in case of so called yield farming opportunities.",34,76.8,2021-05-26
['Proposal: Disable MKR borrowing'],"@LongForWisdom thanks for joining the Aave forum! i understand your concerns - of course there is still the possibility of aggregating the MKR liquidity from multiple lending protocols, although this is something that disabling borrowing on aave only wouldn’t necessarily prevent, unless Aave becomes the “place to go” to borrow against MKR. If that is the case as you are suggesting - ie making aware the MKR holders that the best place to borrow against MKR is aave - we can imagine MKR liquidity across other lending protocols might dry up - in that case, a safe borrow cap, consistently below the margin of risk - eg 0.1% of the total MKR supply (i’m not completely aware of the MKR governance dynamics so that might be still too high - just to give an idea, can be lower ofc) would help?
To be clear, i’m personally 100% in favor of the proposal - i simply believe that for Aave, acquiring governance power on other DeFi protocols is critically important and would be a shame missing out on this opportunity.",33,31.6,2021-05-26

We are in the unfortunate position that due to governance roadblock and developer badwidth, that option is not possible at this time. Thus I have come to you and the community as a workaround.

 Emilio:

Can you explain what you mean by acquiring governance power? Is Aave intending to use lended funds of users to vote in their protocols? Sort of a proxy delegate?



 Emilio:

Aave already is the “place to go” ",34,76.8,2021-05-26
['Proposal: Disable MKR borrowing'],"Aave acquires a certain part of the interest repaid by borrowers, based on a parameter called reserve factor. For MKR, it’s set to 20% (so 20% of the MKR repaid by MKR borrowers is accumulated by Aave). These MKR accumulated are automatically reinvested in Aave in the form of aMKR, so they start generate interest as well. This is true for all the assets listed on Aave - you can see the collector contract here InitializableAdminUpgradeabilityProxy | 0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c, the governance currently holds 3.37 aMKR.
So by disabling borrowing, the main disadvantage for the aave governance is losing this constant stream of MKR - which i personally believe is valuable beyond its market value, so an asset worth acquiring for the governance itself.
Same happens for all the other defi protocols listed - YFI, CRV, UNI, SUSHI and so on.",33,61.6,2021-05-26
['Proposal: Disable MKR borrowing'],If that is the deal breaker I would be willing to propose to the Maker community an annual MKR compensation based on total MKR held on Aave or something similar. Based on historical revenues as a percentage of borrow to lend ratio we could mint that amount of MKR and send it to the treasury annually averaged out. Just spitballing ideas. If Maker governance isn’t willing to meaningfully change tokenomics to curtail existing incentives then I’m open to more creative ideas.

[' Proposal: Adapt contracts slightly to improve DeFi composability'],"
Summary
The Enzyme core dev team would like to propose a minor code addition by AAVE to support stkAAVE Liquidity Mining natively on Enzyme.
Aave incentive contracts currently only contain claiming functions in which the caller specifies the recipient to address, who will receive the claimed rewards. Unfortunately, this poses a security problem for abstractly-designed smart contract claimants that do not have fully-trusted originators of claiming txs. This is the case for Enzyme vaults.
By adding an additional claiming function to the incentive contract that uses msg.sender instead of to, the tx originator no longer needs to be trusted.
This simple addition - that can reuse the exact same claiming logic as the current claiming functions and will not require any changes to storage layout - will increase composability opportunities with Enzyme and similarly architected protocols.

Background
Enzyme is a decentralised asset management infrastructure built on Ethereum. It allows asset managers to build on-chain investment Vaults that utilise and allocate to the newest innovations in DeFi. Because all transactions occur on the Ethereum blockchain, compliance, accounting, and investor management services are rendered programatically and at a dramatically-reduced cost to their traditional finance counterparts.
Amongst other things, Enzyme Vaults can interact with AAVE by lending. We are currently also working on accommodating the borrowing functionality to enable leveraged strategies as part of our Sulu release.
In order to keep providing our users with superior asset management tools in DeFi, we want to open up the liquidity mining option for them as soon as possible. Our users rely on having the latest DeFi functionality in Enzyme to reach their full potential.

Enzyme Growth & Traction
Since our v2 release (end of January) Enzyme has seen very strong growth in Enzyme’s TVL.
TVL has increase by nearly 1,750% during this period (less than 5 months) to reach about $100m.
This is an outperformance of nearly 1650% vs ETH in dollar terms.
High profile managers like USF Fund, The Yang Express, Techemy Capital, Rhino, Apophis and others have had great traction and continue to attract new users.

Use Cases
There are many different use-cases for Enzyme Vaults. These include;

Yield farming strategies (eg; utilising our Curve pool integrations)
Meta-Yield farming strategies (eg; building strategies around strategies)
Long/short Vaults (with the use of our Synthetix adapter)
Passive strategies (eg. ETFs or Indices)
Robo strategies (eg. using Enzyme SDK)
Market Making strategies (eg. leveraging native integrations with Uniswap, Curve, etc)


Proposal

Add function claimRewardsToSelf(address[] calldata assets, uint256 amount) to the liquidity mining incentives contract, which reuses the logic of claimRewards() but uses msg.sender instead of to



Benefit for AAVE

Increased AAVE adoption by the Enzyme user base and other similarly architected protocols
Tapping into a new and extremely fast-growing community
A closer collaboration between our two projects & communities
Enzyme contracts have been audited by PWC, Chain Security and some of the leading auditors in the space who sit on the Enzyme Council
Opening up the possibility for new and novel use-cases to be built around AAVE

As part of our investment strategies we are looking forward to the ability to leverage via borrowing from Aave. It would be of a great help if our depositors were able to get stAAVE rewards as the regular users of Aave. In fact I believe more portfolio managers would be interested in allocating to Aave via Enzyme if the rewards were harvestable.

['Proposal: Add support for 1INCH Token'],"Summary:
This is a proposal for adding borrow/lend support for the 1inch token (1INCH) on Aave
Background:
The 1INCH token will be used to govern all 1inch network protocols, taking governance in the DeFi space to a new level. DeFi is a rapidly evolving space, but most governance modules are not designed to upgrade and change protocols quickly to respond to changes in the market. Therefore, we are introducing what we call the instant governance feature, which enables the community to vote for specific protocol settings under the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) model, in a transparent, user-friendly and efficient way.
In the 18 months that the 1inch aggregator protocol has been live, it has processed over $12B in volume. Moreover, 1inch’s latest protocol has a TVL of over $700M.
The 1inch Foundation, located on the Cayman Islands, can mint new tokens, based on proposals made via DAO governance. Once a more advanced DAO governance functionality, which similar to that of Compound, has been implemented, only the DAO will have the authority to issue new tokens.
Why a1INCH:
1INCH, the native token of our platform, is already a well-traded asset with an average daily trading volume in excess of $100M and tradable on most major exchanges, including Binance, Huobi, OKEX, Poloniex and Coinomi.
Our community consists of experienced DeFi traders and amasses over 90,000 active wallets that use our smart contracts. We believe that the addition of our token to Aave will step up activity on the platform and provide a vast number of opportunities to the communities of both products. A natural next step is to now create a lending market, and we can’t think of a better place to do that than the Aave community. Being able to borrow and lend 1INCH tokens would facilitate:

users’ increased exposure to synth assets and their market presence.
creating interest bearing a1INCH, which can be both staked in other protocols and loaned out to DAOs with unsecured loans via Credit Delegation.
creating leveraged 1INCH trades.

Benefits for Aave:

1inch has a very active community which would bring more users and liquidity to Aave.
1inch earns native yield through liquidity mining on the 1inch exchange.
With deposit rates so high, it becomes financially attractive for people to borrow funds with 1INCH as collateral.
More multi-platform initiatives in the future between our protocols. The 1inch aggregator already supports liquidations from Aave and synth assets swaps.

Extra:
Aave platform could stake 1INCH tokens in st1INCH, same way as stored DAI inside CHAI a while ago. This would allow to have additional earnings for liquidity providers.

['ARC: Move Control of Price Oracle to Governance V2'],"The Price Oracle is a critical part of the protocol and is used throughout to define the price for all assets. For example, when a position is liquidated, the value of the collateral is compared to the borrow balance using prices taken from this oracle.

Current owner of Price Oracle
This is the mainnet contract for Price Oracle V2: 0xa50ba011c48153de246e5192c8f9258a2ba79ca9
The Price Oracle V2 contract is Ownable and its owner is currently 0xb9062896ec3a615a4e4444df183f0531a77218ae which is a proxy with implementation set to Gnosis Multisig. As you can see here, the owners of the multisig are 5 EOA accounts which I assume are members of the core team. Any three of these 5 people together can transact with the price oracle freely without any delay or timelock.

What can the owner do?
Among other things, the owner of Price Oracle V2 can run the following restricted function of the price oracle:
/// @notice External function called by the Aave governance to set or replace sources of assets
/// @param assets The addresses of the assets
/// @param sources The address of the source of each asset
function setAssetSources(address[] calldata assets, address[] calldata sources)
    external
    onlyOwner

This function can be used to replace the price feed source for any asset on Aave. For example, the current price feed source for BAL is set to Chainlink BAL/ETH feed.

Can the owner compromise user funds?
Yes. A malicious owner can perform the following simple attack:

Replace the price feed for an asset with a dummy contract that returns an arbitrary price of zero.
Find a position where the collateral is the asset whose price is now zero.
Liquidate the position (now possible since the collateral is worthless).
Receive the collateral after liquidation.
Change the price feed back to its original value.

Here is a different attack:

Replace the price feed for BAL with a dummy contract that returns a huge number.
Give 1 BAL as collateral to the protocol.
Borrow a huge amount of any other asset (now possible since the collateral has immense value).
Change the price feed back to its original value.
Disappear with the borrowed amount and abandon the 1 BAL.

In other words, any three of the 5 people in the core team multisig can compromise user funds.

Proposal
Giving the core team access to user funds may be acceptable in new/small projects that don’t have proper decentralized governance. Aave is neither new - the governance system is mature - nor small - the TVL is currently over $18 billion.
No matter how much we trust these 5 people, they should not have access to $18 billion of user funds. People can be hacked, human error on their behalf can put the funds at risk. I don’t believe any existing DeFi project with comparable TVL currently gives its core team access to user funds. I also don’t believe the community is fully aware of this. I personally discovered this by accident and was thoroughly surprised.
The proposal is to move control over the Price Oracle to the governance. If this proposal is not accepted, the responsible bare minimum would be to add a time lock preventing immediate changes to the oracle.",23,124.6,2021-05-11

['ARC: Move Control of Price Oracle to Governance V2'],"@talkol, thank you very much for taking the time to review the protocol configuration and permissions. After the launch of V2 a few months ago, a multisig had ownership over the price oracle contract for technical and security reasons.  over the last six months, chainlink made multiple updates to the oracle–including, importantly, the OCR (Offchain Reporting) which required a major rearchitecture of the price feeds (as well as numerous change on the price feeds themselves).  Such updates would have been extremely difficult for community governance to implement, and ensuring the safety of V2 is of the utmost importance.  chainlink has confirmed that it does not have any further updates planed in the immediate future.  for that reason and given the commitment to complete decentralization of the protocol, ownership of the price oracle contracts was moved to the short executor of the Aave governance.  you can find the transactions here - V1 Ethereum Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | Etherscan and V2 Ethereum Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | Etherscan",17,133.4,2021-05-13
['Gasless Voting on Aave'],"Hello everyone,
Today I would like to talk about gasless Voting on Aave.
Why?
Because the voting system is extremely important and relevant to the whole DAO we need more people to be involved in votings. The problem is that probably most small holders won’t vote because of high gas fees on chain.
That’s why I would like to recommend and take a look at Bancors try with gasless votings.
See here full explanation: UPDATED: Gasless Voting via Snapshot - BIP Discussion - Bancor Governance Forum
Implementing something similar would probably get us more votes for pending AIPs. And the more people are voting the more realistic the votes can and will be. As not a few single whales are gonna decide which way Aave should go.

The issue with gasless voting is that requires some level of trust. Essentially you can create an offchain system (like the one of snapshot) that collects the voters preference through message signing instead of submitting transactions, which does not cost anything. The issue comes when you try to submit the result onchain, because there is no guarantee that the centralized party will submit the result correctly (either because of malicious behavior or bugs). Due to that, some systems in the past tried to use a dispute mechanism on proposals submission, so that if there is a malicious attempt to submit tampered results onchain the vote can be invalidated.

Second issue is that in my opinion average token holders don’t get informed enough about AAVE ecosystem and might see voting as a chore. My suggestion is adding a small incentive funded from the AAVE reserve on top of the first proposition to incentivize voting.

2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token.

Rocket Pool is an Ethereum 2.0 Proof of Stake infrastructure service.
rETH is a redemption token representing staked ETH.
Without a stake pool service, only wealthy network participants who meet the 32ETH threshold are rewarded for validating transactions.
Rocket Pool democratizes participation in network validation by providing a service which lowers the wealth threshold.
Abstracting staked ETH as rETH participants are able to retain commodity properties of their stake (transfer of ownership).

3. Provide a brief history of the project.

2017 - Rocket Pool proof of concept based on the specifications released for Casper in the Mauve paper by Vitalik Buterin.
Today there is a great team working on Rocket Pool passionately alongside a fantastic community. Both have helped Rocket Pool run two public betas with over 50,000 ETH (testnet) staked and hundreds of users participating over the last 1–2 years.

Summary
JPYC is ERC20 token as Prepaid Payment Instruments for Own Business. we are going to propose a JPY-pegged stablecoin, legally dealt as a Prepaid Payment Instrument in Japan. Starting from Bitcoin and Ethereum, there are thousands of rising payment methods via cryptocurrencies leveraged by blockchain technology from around the 2010s, but large fluctuating prices have been the cause
of difficulty in buying and selling goods. From this point of view, several projects appeared featuring USD-pegged stablecoins with fiat money and cryptocurrencies used as collaterals. As opposed to that, JPY-pegged stablecoins have been far from practical use.
JPYCoin (hereinafter referred to as JPYC), will expand the target of customers compared to ICB, which is for business use only, and streamline the cryptocurrency payment in buying and selling goods, for the public use as a Prepaid Payment Instrument.
Overview


About price maintenance mechanism
JPYC is a Prepaid Payment Instrument and basically 1 JPYC is equal to 1Yen. Through the price maintenance mechanism, users are released from the payment method leveraged by blockchain with the traditional price fluctuation risk, and able to use as a payment for the procurement of goods.
Below are the mechanisms to support the users’ healthy economic activities.


When 1 JPYC < 1 Yen（under 1 Yen）
When the price of 1 JPYC is continuously under 1 Yen on average for a long time period at decentralized exchanges like Uniswap, the issuer tries to increase the secondary distribution price, by depositing to the Legal Affairs Bureau more than the amount required by the Payment Services Act, more than 50% of Unused Base Date Balance, or receiving a financial institution guarantee as required by the law. At the moment, we deposit 200% of the amount under the law and 10 million Yen to the authority. Once the deposit sum is increased, we will notice after the deposit via our website or other media.


Thereby, if we should go bankrupt, bankruptcy remoteness is still effective, which is why we think we can protect the rights of JPYC users, but we cannot guarantee the principal.
When JPYC > 1 Yen（over 1 Yen）
When the secondary distribution price of 1 JPYC is over 1 Yen, we believe the price will be stable approaching 1 Yen by our continuous selling at a ratio of 1 JPYC to 1 Yen. Besides, regardless of above when the average price of the secondary distribution has been over 1 Yen for a long time and we deposited over the amount required by the Payment Services Act (hereinafter referred to as excessive deposit, including financial institution guarantee), in order to prevent the decrease in capital efficiency due the excessive deposit, the portion of the deposit might be withdrawn, the amount determined by us that the average secondary market price is not less than 1 Yen within a range of 30% or less.

When the large parts of initially issued JPYC is distributed in the market
We will 100 million JPYC initially, but there might be some possibility that that amount of JPYC cannot meet the market needs because of the increasing JPYC needs. After the predetermined percentage of JPYC has been supplied to the market, we will proceed to the next phase and additional JPYC will be issued to maintain the appropriate amount of JPYC to meet demand. More details will be provided later in 2.4.

Positioning within Aave Ecosystem
JPYC will have a positive impact on AAVE; the JPYC community has grown to over 500 members in less than a month. The JPYC community has grown to over 500 members in less than a month, and with the release of UniswapV3, there are even more users looking for it. In addition, the support from AAVE will provide a gateway to connect the JPY economy with crypto.
JPYC will be rebranded and significantly upgraded to release JPYC Apps, which implements the “goods purchase function” and “JPY→JPYC” and “ETH→JPYC” functions.
AAVE is the first ERC20 stable coin to be pegged to JPY in Japan, providing an opportunity to further engage Japanese users.
Project History
JPYC is a Japanese yen stablecoin issued by Japan crypto asset market founded in November 2019.JPYC is a stablecoin issued in January 2021.
We have issued a stabled coin that is designed to be exchanged for goods. By issuing it as a prepaid means of payment, we have already had discussions with the FSA.
Market, Social and Contract Data
JPYC is already tradable on UniswapV3, Quickswap (Polygon), and Honeyswap (xDai); UniswapV3 had the 17th highest liquidity among UniswapV3 with $10k traded in less than a day.Currently, there are 236 holders and about $20k in circulation.
Security Considerations
JPYC has undergone extensive code reviews and an audit by TECHFUND (linked above).
If you have any questions, please feel free to ask anything.

Summary
FXS is the governance token of the Frax stablecoin protocol. FXS currently has a $110 million market capitalization on approximately $20 million of daily volume. The FXS token currently governs over $300 million of value within the Frax protocol. FXS is not currently listed as an asset on any decentralized money market protocols. The Frax community has expressed demand to leverage against FXS and lend / borrow FRAX, making Aave the ideal market for both assets.  Frax is already integrating with Aave and is currently the 4th largest aUSDC holder and growing, demonstrating a strong synergy between the communities.
v2 of the Frax protocol was recently announced and introduces a lending module that can be built directly onto Aave. This would enable the Frax protocol to supply large amounts of FRAX to Aave on demand. The first step towards this integration is the addition of FRAX and FXS as assets on Aave.
Overview
FRAX is a fractionally algorithmic stablecoin with a dynamic collateral ratio that adjusts based on the market demand for FRAX. Currently, each FRAX is collateralized by approximately $0.87 USDC and $0.13 of the Frax governance token, FXS. When the price of FRAX is at or above $1.00, the protocol gradually lowers the collateralization ratio of USDC to FXS. When the price of FRAX is below $1.00, the protocol gradually increases the ratio. FRAX can always be minted or redeemed by the protocol for $1.00 of assets, which counterbalances significant price deviations from the $1.00 target. Frax emphasizes a highly autonomous approach with no active management of the price stability function. FXS is integral to the functioning of the Frax system, both as a volatility sink and stabilizing token within the protocol. FXS holders participate in the governance of the protocol.
The Frax community recently approved the investment of system collateral, currently approximately $96m USDC, into yield bearing USDC. Accordingly, the protocol began supplying USDC to Aave to earn a return on this collateral. Frax already has over 15,000,000 aUSDC and will continue increasing deposits on Aave, demonstrating a strong synergy between the Frax and Aave communities.  Frax is currently the #4 largest holder of aUSDC. Continued growth of the Frax protocol and system collateral could lead to Frax becoming one of the larger suppliers of USDC to Aave.
Positioning within Aave Ecosystem
The Frax community is very active and looking for venues to lend and borrow FXS. Aave should enjoy increased revenue from the lending and borrowing of FXS, as well as additional USDC deposits as the Frax collateral pool grows. While Frax is often lumped together with “algorithmic stablecoin” protocols, a closer analysis shows that the Frax protocol is in fact stable and capital efficient.
Frax recently announced v2 of the Frax protocol. v2 introduces algorithmic market operations controllers (AMOs). AMOs are autonomous contracts that build on the base Frax protocol without disrupting it’s operation. The team has proposed incorporating lending AMOs directly into decentralized lending markets. The lending AMO could be built directly on Aave to supply large amounts of FRAX from the protocol to Aave. This would effectively create a FRAX dispenser on Aave, somewhat analogous to the Fed discount window, where borrowers could borrow directly from the FRAX protocol via Aave. A direct integration with Aave will also make supplying FRAX more attractive to other market participants because there is a guarantee of FRAX liquidity directly from the protocol, avoiding the pitfalls of high utilization rates on money markets. This integration could drive significant TVL and fees to Aave.
A direct integration with Frax via a lending AMO contract will offer Aave users the ability to effectively mint and redeem stablecoins on demand via Aave. From a borrower’s perspective, direct protocol integration should keep the supply relatively steady, which should keep borrowing costs low and predictable. This would make FRAX an ideal stablecoin to borrow. To realize this integration, FXS and FRAX need to first be added as collateral on Aave.
Project History
The project launched in December 2020. The project is currently using snapshot voting for governance. The project has deployed Compound Governor Alpha; it is fully functional but awaiting the minimal threshold of FXS to be emitted. There is a 48 hour timelock for governance.
Frax underwent a significant expansion and contraction withing the first 2 months of launch, providing a stress test for the protocol. In a three week period, the supply of FRAX increased over 5x, from approximately 25m to 134m. The supply of FRAX then contracted by approximately 33%. FRAX maintained a tight band around $1.00 throughout the cycle, and as expected FXS experience high levels of volatility during this time. The team has subsequently released updates to the protocol to smooth volatility during expansions and contractions, most importantly the updated PID controller for the protocol. V2 of the protocol also includes an interest rate module, intended to dampen FXS volatility during periods of contraction.
FXS Usage and Emission
Within the Frax protocol, FXS absorbs volatility to keep the price of FRAX at $1.00. When FRAX is minted, FXS is burned in proportion to the collateral ratio. For example, at the current collateral ratio of 87%, $0.13 of FXS is burned for every FRAX that is minted. When FRAX is burned and removed from circulation, and equivalent amount of FXS is minted. Since launch, a net of approximately 450k FXS have been burned.
The entire genesis supply of FXS will be emitted over the next 37 months. 60% of the supply is being distributed to the community via liquidity mining. During the first year, at least 50% of the supply will be emitted. The exact supply emission depends on the collateral ratio of the protocol.  Further information can be found in the documentation linked above.
There are no admin controls on FXS.
Market, Social and Contract Data
FXS has a market capitalization of approximately $108m. The 24 hour trading volume is approximately $20m. FXS has approximately $50m of liquidity across Uniswap and Sushiswap trading pairs. FXS is also listed on Binance, which can account for up to 50% of total daily volume. The 24 hour trading volume is approximately $20m.
Frax’s telegram is the main social channel with 5,600+ members.  The contracts were deployed December 16 2020. There have been 74k transfers and currently 2,591 holders.
Security Considerations
Frax has undergone extensive code reviews and an audit by Certik (linked above). Frax is in the process of undergoing additional audits. The protocol currently has approximately $300m TVL.

I appreciate you taking the time to review.  Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

['Proposal: Add support for FXS'],"Have you looked into FRAX at all or any of the specifics around the project?  We can do better than dismiss a project because it shares the terms “algorithmic” and “stablecoin”.  In 2018 / 2019, a lot of people looked at LEND and wrote it off because of the ICO hangover / bear market.  And yet, here we are.  It’s also worth noting that this proposal is for the addition of FXS, which is the governance token of the Frax protocol.  There are 14 other volatile governance tokens listed on Aave and I do not think FXS is materially different.
FRAX first and foremost is a stablecoin.  The stability mechanism combines collateral (“fractional”) with preset rules (“algorithmic”).  Each FRAX token is currently backed by $0.87 of USDC and interest bearing USDC.  This is a world apart from purely “algorithmic stablecoins”.  I respect other projects desire to innovate and try new things, however I’m not sure that any of those projects have nailed the “stablecoin” side of things.
For FRAX, the result has been a high level of stability around $1.00 since launch.  FRAX has effectively had the stability of fiat backed stablecoins.  These charts are slightly dated now but the stability of FRAX has only increased in the intervening time:

Credit to Warp Capital for performing the following analysis earlier this month. There have been no notable changes or deviations for FRAX since this analysis was performed:
From inception FRAX has maintained the peg of $1, trading within the normal range. Figure 1 illustrates the USD price for the last 30 days of stablecoins from different groups: fiat-backed like BUSD, GUSD etc.; algorithmic with overcollaterization like sUSD, DAI; elastic like AMPL and algoseignorage like BAC, ESD and FRAX. The noticeable divergence is present for BAC and ESD – fully algoseignorage without any collateral. Also, elastic AMPL converges to the peg with the high volatility.

That being said, the only perfect projects are the ones that never launch.  I’m happy to engage in valid criticisms of Frax.  Since launch, one of the better criticisms has been that FRAX is basically wrapped USDC and accordingly it’s not very decentralized.  I think this was a fair point at the start but is less valid now.  There are tradeoffs made with any project.  Frax prioritized stability and capital efficiency at the start, understanding that it’s always possible to further decentralize collateral over time but it would be very difficult to regain user confidence if Frax was fully decentralized but highly volatile and useless as a stablecoin.  The push to decentralize collateral is a huge priority for the team and community but not at the expense of safety and stability in the near term.
Fast forward to the present and the protocol has diversified the collateral into Aave, Compound and Yearn.  Now, freezing Frax’s collateral involves freezing Aave, Compound and Yearn’s USDC.  This is incremental progress but significantly strengthens the decentralization of Frax’s collateral.  With the recent release of v2, the groundwork has been established to add other forms of collateral and fully decentralize the collateral.  If you look at other aspects of Frax, you’ll find a similar story - the team and community understand what needs to be done and are aggressively executing on it.",133,691.6,2021-03-15

Our financial system has degraded so far that arguments that something is “not as bad as it was” is acceptable for something supposed to be a peg. Less valid is still valid.

Introduction
Before moving onto our suggested design, it’s important to understand how the current Safety Module works as well as its flaws.
Aave’s Safety Module is effectively an insurance product, albeit a simple, unlevered one. The current Safety Module insurance model consists of a single pool which underwrites Aave protocol risk, including smart contract risk, oracle failure risk, and liquidation risk. Assuming the recent ARC is passed the Safety Module will be composed of AAVE and Balancer Pool Tokens (BPT) of an 80/20 AAVE/ETH Balancer Pool. In case a shortfall event is triggered by governance, up to 30% of the Safety Module is auctioned off to make the protocol whole. If this 30% isn’t enough, the Aave issuance model will issue Aave and auction it off until the insolvent market is made solvent.
We believe the current design has a few key flaws:

Capital Inefficient:

Insurance relies on leverage for efficiency, meaning each $1 in the capital pool must be used to underwrite >$1 of risk. This in turn can only be achieved by underwriting a diversified set of risks such that not all claims are due simultaneously. Unlevered insurance products will result in low returns for underwriters and high prices for users.
In addition, the unified capital pool bundles different risks together and offers a blended return that will appeal to a narrower capital base.


Systemic Risk:

The unified capital pool means that any new market added to Aave is automatically insured, introducing unlimited contagion and systemic risk.
This in turn will hamper the speed at which Aave can innovate by increasing the costs of potential failed experiments.


Cover demand bundled in: With cover demand being bundled in with the money market product, it’s impossible to determine how much underwriters should be paid as well as what cover capacity actually is. This is unlikely to give users certainty that they’d be paid out in case of a Shortfall Event.
Pro-cyclical: With the Safety Module being denominated in $AAVE and insurance liabilities being denominated in other assets (mostly USD), there is likely to be significant correlation and reflexivity between Shortfall Events and declines in the value of $AAVE, especially considering the potential of a mint.

Note: While pro-cyclicality is a real issue, it is more related to the way the capital pool is managed vs the insurance design per se. Our proposals will thus focus primarily on addressing the first three issues.
In our initial suggested solution, we had self-sovereign, independent aDAOs which each operated and governed their own money-markets, earning the majority of the fees generated. We chose this design because, in the existing design, insurance is bundled in with the money markets such that demand for insurance is impossible to compute separately from money market demand. Without a market-based mechanism to determine cover price and capacity, our design instead offloaded these decisions to independent aDAOs who bore both the risk and reward relating to the money markets they managed. This, we hoped, would incentivize good decisions by the principle of skin in the game, ensuring those making decisions are forced to bear the potential downside if they go wrong.
In our new design, insurance is offered as a separate product on the demand side. This makes it possible to compute cover demand and capacity precisely and thus scale back some of the independence provided to aDAOs.
Based on this insight, we propose two models. The first is a simplified, unlevered version which could act as an evolutionary step towards the second model which we see as the optimal, final form design. In both cases, the demand-side experience is identical: users get access to one-click insurance with a money market style architecture leveraging Aave’s current interest rate model to calculate cover pricing based on utilisation rate. The designs differ in terms of their supply-side experience; In the first case, users can only stake to the Safety Module, underwriting all risks and receiving a blended return based on cover demand. In the second case, users also stake to the Safety Module but are then able to boost these returns by staking to specific contracts, taking on different amounts of risk and being rewarded accordingly.
Unified Insurance Pool Model
We will begin by describing the UX on both the demand and supply-side. We will then go through an example model with some numbers to illustrate our point.
Demand-side UX
A simple UX where the user can gain one-click insurance. Rather than paying for it upfront as with current decentralised insurance designs, the user pays for it on an ongoing basis as the cover rate is subtracted from his deposit APY. The UX steps are as follows:

Aave front-end displays two deposit APY interest rates for each money market: the current, uninsured interest rate and a lower one with insurance.

Similar to the current Aave interest rate model, there could also be stable and fixed interest rates with the latter providing certainty similar to that of buying cover in existing solutions.


If the user selects the insured deposit, he can do so in one click, with the following two transactions happening in the background:

User deposits $USDC, receives $aaUSDC (insured $USDC).
User’s $aaUSDC would accrue value at the insured APY rate (money market APY - insurance cost).
Interest rate paid is determined by the Safety Module’s utilisation rate just as any other money market pool on Aave (see supply-side UX section for more details).
The insurance cost (paid in $USDC) would be used to buy $AAVE, which would then be deposited into the Safety Module as an insurance premium for stakers.


The user’s deposit APY interest is automatically deposited as $aUSDC and his cost of insurance is automatically deducted. The insured user earns the net of interest from $aUSDC deposit APY and the cost of insurance.
If the user wants to withdraw his $USDC, he can also do so in one-click, with the following happening in the background:

User withdraws his $aaUSDC to $USDC.
As $aaUSDC supply decreases, capacity opens up in the Safety Module.
Extra: It would make sense to have automated features such that users can automatically pay back their insurance if the net yield goes negative or below a certain threshold.



Supply-side UX
The supply-side would work similarly to the current experience:

Users would be able to lock their $AAVE into the Safety Module and receive $stkAAVE at a 1:1 value ratio.
Users would see an Insurance Yield based on the current utilization of the Safety Module.
Governance would determine the maximum cover capacity per pool and the global minimum capital requirement (MCR) in relation to the size of the Safety Module.

1003×925
Example Model
To exemplify the above, let’s take a closer look at what this would look like for a user looking to insure their USDC deposit.
First, let’s consider the demand side. The two most important variables for a user looking to insure their USDC deposits are: 1) the USDC money market APY and 2) the insurance cost. The APY would work in the same way as it works in the current Aave model, which depends on the interest rate model and utilization. In a similar fashion, the insurance cost, which is effectively an interest rate, would depend on the interest rate model used. Given that Aave already has an interest rate model, we propose the same model for the insurance pools, albeit with slightly different parameters.
Compared to a money market pool, we see the insurance pool interest rate model working in the following way:
960×282
The previous parameters, which would be chosen by governance, are what determine the insurance pool interest rate model. Compared to the money market parameters, we propose working with a lower R0 to account for the fact that money market APY depends on utilization, which starts at 0.
In the following figure, we show what this interest rate model looks like at the same utilisation levels (money market and insurance pool). The difference between the APY (blue line) and the insurance cost (orange line) is the insured APY (grey line). Notice that at the same utilisation levels, there’s a minimum utilisation threshold from where it makes sense to buy insurance (in this case around 20%), since any lower utilisation level would imply a negative insured APY for the user. Nevertheless, it is possible some users may choose to incur negative insured APY in order to access leverage while being sure their deposits are protected.
1341×731
Note: For illustration purposes, the chart only goes to 75% utilisation. After 75%, interest rates rise sharply which makes visualizing the point more difficult
In practice, it’s unlikely that the utilisation rate for the money market and the insurance pool will be the same at any given point in time. The following table shows what the insured APY (money market APY – insurance cost) looks like at different utilization levels. As was hinted before, it clearly illustrates how the insured APY depends on the utilization levels of the money market and the insurance pool. Cells highlighted in green indicate positive insured yields, while non-highlighted cells indicate the opposite.
1162×620
On the supply side the insurance yield would depend on the utilisation (by all money markets and insured products) of the cover capacity of the Safety Module:
364×552
Lastly, the effective yield for Safety Module stakers would depend on the minimum global collateralization factor (that determines global capacity) and the share of the fees that get distributed to the Safety Module (versus the Aave Reserve).
Discussion
We believe this model mitigates a few of the flaws with the Safety Module that we highlighted in the introduction.
Firstly, contagion and systemic risk are mitigated since users must buy cover rather than have it bundled in, meaning the Safety Module’s liabilities are constrained and can be computed precisely. As a result, permissionless innovation can happen quicker since decisions about listing assets are separate from decisions about insuring those assets. Aave could theoretically list an asset that it chooses not to insure with the Safety Module or that it chooses to insure only up to a certain limit.
The primary drawback of this model is that it imposes a uniform insurance cost across all Aave money markets which doesn’t account for the differing risks posed by the different assets being underwritten. In a rational market, an equilibrium price may be reached at an insurance cost higher than what users are willing to pay for less risky assets but lower than what users are willing to pay for risky assets. This will lead to adverse selection in which riskier insurance demand crowds out demand for less risky assets. While this could be solved via governance defining the maximum cover capacity per pool, this is inelegant as it defers to governance what could be determined via market-based mechanisms.
In addition, while more efficient than the current Safety Module, in its current iteration this model is still unlevered. While leverage could be added and determined at the governance level, the aforementioned flaws of the uniform insurance cost are amplified by leverage since users can now take out even more cover on risky assets. This could be mitigated by governance determining weights but we believe it’s better to use market-based mechanisms where possible.
Segregated Insurance Pools
To solve the issues with the Unified Insurance Pool Model, we propose Segregated Insurance Pools similar in spirit to our original aDAO proposal.
On the demand-side the UX works similarly to the Unified Insurance Pool Model as users still have access to one-click insurance. However, rather than paying a single insurance cost across the entire protocol, each money market pool would have its own insurance cost. This is enabled by a more complex supply-side UX in which $stkAAVE holders can choose to stake into individual pools, earning a higher share of that pool’s fees in exchange for acting as the first tranche of risk capital in case of a Shortfall Event.
We believe this model enables the greatest capital efficiency by using market-based mechanisms on both the demand and supply side to determine cover pricing and returns to stakers. Leverage can still be determined at the protocol level but capacity will be allocated at the insurance pool level.
Demand-side UX
The demand-side would work in a similar way to the previous implementation:

Let’s assume the user is depositing into the USDC pool. If the user selects the insured deposit, he can do so in one click with the following happening in the background:

User deposits $USDC, receives $aaUSDC (insured $USDC).
User’s $aaUSDC would accrue value at the insured APY rate (money market APY - insurance cost). Insurance cost would be determined by capacity in the USDC insurance pool.
The insurance cost (paid in $USDC) would be used to buy $AAVE, which would then be deposited into the $aUSDC Insurance pool, the $stkAAVE pool and the AAVE Reserve at a ratio determined by the community.


If the user wants to withdraw his $USDC, he can also do so in one-click, with the following happening in the background:

User withdraws his $aaUSDC to $USDC.
As $aaUSDC supply decreases, capacity opens up in the USDC insurance pool.



Supply-side UX
On the supply-side, users can take different amounts of risk based on their preference. The UX steps can be seen as follows:

Users can stake to the Safety Module by converting $AAVE to $stkAAVE at a 1:1 value ratio. That means that a user who deposits 10USD worth of $AAVE would get 10USD worth of $stkAAVE back. As fees are deposited into the $stkAAVE Pool, it is possible that the value of $stkAAVE (which represents a share of the $stkAAVE Pool) differs from the value of $AAVE.
Users can take their $stkAAVE and lock it into specific contracts they want to insure with some amount of leverage as determined by governance.

For instance, if the leverage is set at 10x, each unit of $stkAAVE can be staked into 10 different insurance pools.


If a user wants to stake to the $aUSDC contract, the following happens:

User locks $stkAAVE and receives $aUSDCpool tokens issued on a virtual bonding curve.
The fees generated from the $aUSDC Insurance Pool would be shared between the $aUSDC Insurance Pool, the $stkAAVE Pool and the AAVE Reserve at a ratio determined by the community.
The amount of $stkAAVE determines overall insurance cover capacity and maximum capacity per pool, whereas the amount of $stkAAVE in the $aUSDC pool determines capacity for $aUSDC cover, effectively shifting the mechanisms to a per pool, market based capacity computation.
Similar to the aDAO bonding curves, the bonding curve is locked at the minimum capital requirement required to satisfy active cover (MCR) at whatever the leverage ratio is. Users will not be able to withdraw while the bonding curve is locked.


If a Shortfall Event occurs, $stkAAVE holders determine whether or not that event is covered by the insurance policy. Shortfall Events in particular contracts will wipe out stakers to those pools first by burning some of their $stkAAVE

As soon as a Shortfall Event is triggered, stakers to contracts are frozen as to restrict them from exiting before a major insurance event is concluded.


To simplify the UX, contracts can be grouped into indexes based on their risk characteristics such as $Apool, $AApool, $BBBpool, etc. If a user stakes his $stkAAVE into one of these indexes, he is automatically staking into all underlying pools in proportion to their size.
Anyone can permissionlessly add a money-market but it is only listed on the Aave front-end if $stkAAVE holders vote to insure it and it attracts a minimum amount of $stkAAVE.

1600×1136
Example Model
The main difference with this model is that it allows for each insurance pool to have its own interest rate model and its own capacity. As such, important risk parameters could be chosen for each pool specifically taking into account their own particularities. Let’s explore an example for a USDC and a YFI pool. Since USDC is less risky, we could set a higher optimal insurance utilisation level for this pool. The next tables show what the interest rate models could look like for these two assets.
726×190
As can be seen, the YFI insurance pool has a lower optimal utilisation level and a higher Rslope2, which accounts for its higher risk. This would, in turn, make insurance above the 45% utilisation level highly expensive. The next graph depicts the insurance cost for this market at different utilisation levels. What is clear from it is that, at utilisation levels above 45% insurance starts getting highly expensive, which would incentivise users to decrease use of the insurance pool.
1539×675
Let’s compare this to what the USDC graph looks like. What can be seen with the following graph is that insurance cost only starts to spike to highly expensive levels when utilisation hits 90%, the optimal utilisation level for the USDC insurance pool.
1518×589
What the above graphs show is that the flexibility to choose the insurance interest rate model for each market has clear advantages as they can be adjusted for the riskiness of each market.
In addition, this model allows for the size of each insurance pool to be determined by a market-driven approach, as it depends on the amount of $stkAAVE staked to each particular pool and the effective leverage of the protocol. If, for example, the maximum leverage allowed by the protocol is 10x, each user gets to stake his $stkAAVE into 10 different insurance pools. To illustrate this point, let’s assume a user holds 100 $stkAAVE. If he chooses to only stake into one pool, then that pool’s capacity would be increased by 100 $stkAAVE and would be effectively backed by 100 $stkAAVE. On the other hand, that user may use leverage and stake 100 $stkAAVE into two pools (or pool indexes), 100 $stkAAVE each. In this case, each pool’s capacity would increase by 100 $stkAAVE, but they would only be backed by 50 $stkAAVE, meaning that they’re leveraged up to 2x (assuming no other stakers for simplicity).
In this sense, this model not only allows for a tailored approach to pricing dependent on the risk characteristics of each market, but also to sizing, as the capacity of each insurance pool would depend on the amount of $stkAAVE staked to it.
Lastly, with this model, an individual staker’s ($aUSDCpool holder) effective yield would depend on his leverage and the individual yields of the pools he’s insuring. In a similar fashion, the stkAAVE pool’s yield would depend on all the individual pools’ yields and the share of those fees that gets distributed to the main stkAAVE pool.
Conclusion
We really appreciate all the excellent feedback and discussion following our first proposal. We’ve incorporated many of the learnings from those discussions into V2. We’ve also sought to provide an achievable path towards implementation. The simpler unified insurance pool design would act as a first step which would also serve to get demand-side users used to buying insurance. The more complex segregated insurance pool design can be implemented later, providing greater capital efficiency and granularity in cover pricing.
It’s worth noting that, in addition to serving as an insurance product to be used by the current Aave money market users, this architecture allows for Aave to offer a generalized insurance product that could extend beyond its current proposed use case. For instance, this insurance architecture could be used to insure protocols that integrate with the Aave platform, such as Aavegotchi. Going even further, this product could be spun off as its own independent insurance platform (controlled and governed by AAVE holders) that would offer a wide range of insurance covers for any accepted projects. To prevent insurance demand from other projects crowding out Aave money market insurance demand, a minimum share of the Safety Module could be exclusively dedicated to cover Aave, with the remaining being distributed among other protocols.
What’s even more important to highlight here, beyond any particular details of what a full-blown insurance product might look like, is that the Safety Module is a critical and flexible piece of infrastructure of the Aave protocol. Thus, with the above consideration we look to encourage discussion around different strategies to effectively use this potent piece of infrastructure going forward. We believe the Safety Module is a competitive advantage for Aave and its effective use to be a key consideration for the future of the protocol.
We look forward to the community’s feedback on our proposals and will be available to answer any questions.

['Aave Token Architecture V2 Proposal'],"This is very much in line with how we (ParaFi) think about improving the staking incentives. More importantly, it’s a critical improvement to strike a balance between increasing asset coverage in the money market while preserving the security/solvency of the protocol. This can happen by siloing and tranching risk as proposed above.
Introducing insurance at the “point of sale” embedded in the rates also makes a ton of sense.

['Aave Token Architecture V2 Proposal'],"An excellent step forward @JonathanErlich and @jose_delphi!
We spoke about a few issues here and there folks- so there’s still some work to be done- but, folks, this tackles a problem that is exteremely relevant to DeFi:
Proper insurance pricing.
It’s absolutely essential for institutional players to know their cost of insurance and insured capital. And, of course, the next step in DeFi is bringing in TradFi users and institutions. Everyone can benefit from Ethereum, it doesn’t have to be “us VS big bad banks.”
If the banks & institutions can execute their business at a higher efficiency and in a secure fashion, they will come. Our duty is to set up that infrastructure- a more secure, more efficient financial system.
Aave could be one of the core building blocks of that financial system, and with some modifications, this proposal would be a significant step in the right direction.
With that said, there are drawbacks to be aware of, but we’ll have to discuss them more as specific parameters get tested & decided upon.
Love the proposal & what you guys over at Delphi are doing!",41,73.2,2021-01-27
['Aave Token Architecture V2 Proposal'],Great proposal @jose_delphi. My only two questions are how we ensure stakers taking on additional risk with providing first loss insurance are adequately compensated if non-insurance related cash flows (eg flashloans) are directed to the general AAVE treasury? If the insurance demand and premiums are low relative to other cash flow generation could we see a situation where yields are relatively unattractive for insurance stakers leading to low participation?,34,6.8,2021-02-04
['Aave Token Architecture V2 Proposal'],"@srs-parafi appreciate the support and the kind words!
@Zer0dot really appreciate all your feedback here - very helpful stuff. To share with the broader community, the problem you pointed out with the segregated pool design is that insuring a single asset is equivalent to taking on the risks of any other asset that can be used as collateral. To see this let’s imagine  a user deposits a risky asset and borrows a safe asset (quite common as users want to unlock liquidity from longer tail assets and borrow stablecoins). Now, let’s imagine the risky asset dumps such that liquidations cannot keep pace and borrowers using risky asset as collateral are now undercollateralised. Assuming these borrowers mostly borrowed safe assets, the safe asset pools are the ones that will be insolvent. As such, it’s not possible to stake to insure specific markets since the risk isn’t contained in that market.
We are brainstorming potential solutions to this but to be clear this doesn’t apply to the unified pool model which is also our near-term recommendation.
@gyoung cheers sir! To answer your questions in turn:


Non-insurance related cashflows will be directed to the general Aave treasury but insurance related cashflows will be directed to the Safety Module (i.e. to stakers). Staker compensation will therefore depend on the demand for insurance and on the price of insurance, which itself depends on the utilisation rate of the Safety Module. We’re working on modeling out what this might look like given different levels of demand and utilisation and will post results here when we have them.


The short answer is yes, but imo that’s the system working as intended. If there’s low demand for insurance compared to supply of underwriting capital, then yields should be low. In this case, Aave could potentially subsidize the yields with issuance while it seeks other demand sources to insure (e.g. Aavegotchi). That said, we expect the demand for insurance to be significant, especially given recent hacks and exploits facing other protocols.

",26,30.2,2021-02-17
['Aave Token Architecture V2 Proposal'],"@jose_delphi - really appreciate the thought going into this proposal.
To add on to the question from @Zer0dot that you addressed above:
The possibility of risk contagion isn’t just limited to market dynamics in liquidation.  The smart contract risk that’s also insured by the pool presumably isn’t cleanly separable by asset, either.  How has your team thought about this part of the issue?",18,13.6,2021-05-05
['Initial (very early) Discussion: Tokenised commodities as collateral on AAVE'],"AAVE currently supports a number of tokenised fiat currencies as collateral. In this same vein, would users benefit from being able to make use of their tokenised commodities (such as gold) as collateral?
I believe that currencies such as tokenised gold could be a useful form of collateral for AAVE users. Although tokenised gold can be controversial and at the very least a bit polarising, I believe that in the future, the addition of a gold-backed token as collateral on AAVE could be beneficial to users.
Tether Gold (XAUT) currently has a market cap just shy of $100 million, and PAX Gold just below $60 million. It is worth mentioning that the latter appears to have a much larger trading volume than the former. I believe these are the largest (by market cap) commodity-backed tokens on the market right now, and both are erc20 tokens.
The benefits of adding such a type of token as collateral I have thought of are:


Users may prefer to hold such an asset as opposed to a fiat-backed stablecoin, to reduce their exposure to inflation


While commodities such as gold can and are currently used as collateral for loans available through other companies and services, I believe the ability to do so through AAVE would be an improvement in efficiency and ease-of-use


Commodity price fluctuations are less likely to be correlated to that of the general cryptocurrency market, in the case of a market flash crash for example


The drawbacks I have so far considered are:


Borrowing rates may be lower than some of the other forms of collateral currently available on AAVE such as fiat-backed stablecoins


There may be legal limitations to working with commodity-backed tokens on AAVE


In my understanding, commodities investors at large may not yet be comfortable working with cryptocurrencies and tokenised representations of their assets

Although PAXG is the current market leader in terms of listings, their aggregate volume is upwards of $1 million per day, most of their individual markets are fairly illiquid and/or with large imbalance between buys and sells.  The price variance between exchanges is also huge - currently $1,830 to $2,070 (not including Uniswap). Redemption should provide an arbitrage opportunity but due to the high minimum redemption of 430 troy ounces but it doesn’t because it doesn’t seem possible to purchase 430 PAXG (~$832,000 USD at current gold spot) on any exchange at anywhere near the spot price.
Screen Shot 2020-09-05 at 15.02.572186×1072 358 KB
PAXG and XAUT also have transparency issues.
Lastly, scalability and sustainability seems to be an issue with PAXG and XAUT. Neither has a mechanism to collect storage fees, while storing gold in audited, insured vaults always has a cost. The larger the token’s market cap, the larger this cost becomes. If token holders hoard tokens and do not transfer them, no revenue is earned on the tokens with which to pay the storage fees. CACHE Gold solves this problem (as well as others) by implementing a small 0.25% per annum storage fee.
Although nobody likes to pay fees, and fees can be a hassle for developers, we feel it is necessary to maintain scalability and sustainability of the token.  As asset backed tokens gain adoption, platforms and token holders will need to come to terms with the fact that secure storage of real, physical assets has a cost that must be paid.
We agree that gold would be a great addition to lending platforms and it would provide small retail investors with the opportunity to earn interest on their gold holdings - something that has previously been difficult if not impossible to do for most retail investors.",51,30.2,2020-09-05

I had not heard of either Bullionix or Icecap Diamonds before, but thank you for sharing as these are both interesting examples of NFT commodities. I can see that Bullionix has a DGX token like you pointed out which represents a gramme of gold. I believe that chainlink can be used alongside commodity NFTs to ensure that market rates are accurate.
Non-fungible tokens in general are possibly a hurdle for AAVE. The assets that can be deposited and borrowed on AAVE to this date are all fungible. We should perhaps discuss the implementation of NFTs into AAVE further.
My thoughts are that NFTs could possibly be used as collateral on AAVE. In order for this to be made possible however, we will need some sort of accurate valuation for these assets that is resistant to manipulation.
I would draw comparisons to physical works of art being used as collateral. This market has emerged somewhat recently just over the past two decades, from what I’ve read. I found this paper written in 2018 to be useful:


papers.ssrn.com



Art as Collateral by William N. Goetzmann, Milad Nozari :: SSRN





One of the complications that faces this market and which I believe would also face NFTs is valuation. Deloitte have reported extensively on the relationship between art and finance this past decade. It seems that although the industry is working to improve transparency and trust, there are still issues relating to standardisation when it comes to valuation. The consequence of this being that there are still concerns over price manipulation within the market. Deloitte’s 2019 report on art and finance can be found here:

Art & Finance report - highlights in the art market | Deloitte
Since our last report in 2017, external factors such as increasing political and economic uncertainty, rapid technological progress, climate change, and social inequality have dominated the headlines on a daily basis.





Maybe we can overcome such challenges with cryptocurrency? Historic transactions for NFTs will be openly available on the blockchain and I am aware that chainlink is working with NFT valuation per this blogpost: https://blog.chain.link/create-dynamic-nfts-using-chainlink-oracles/

Paragraph Summary
The DEFI Top 5 Index (DEFI5) is an hyper-focused ETF produced by Indexed Finance aimed at tracking the performance of the top decentralized finance protocols on Ethereum. We believe that DEFI5 would make an excellent collateral candidate on Aave.
DEFI5 is currently the largest ETF offered by Indexed, with US$16 million TVL at the time of writing, and is the best-performing DeFi ETF both since inception (558%) and YTD (446%).

Motivation
Unlocking utility for index holders - such as being whitelisted for usage as collateral on lending platforms - is a key focus for the Indexed protocol.
Recently, Indexed started pushing liquidity of its indices towards Polygon in an effort to make indices available to smaller investors who have been priced out of the Ethereum mainnet by gas prices.
At the time of writing, the Quickswap pair DEFI5-ETH has over US$4.2million in liquidity, and DEFI5-QUICK has over US$1.2million. This makes DEFI5 one of the largest assets on Polygon in terms of liquidity and trading volume. Several of the other ETFs offered by Indexed Finance are also traded (and incentivized) on Quickswap.
If accepted, DEFI5 would be the first index token listed as collateral on Aave. Index tokens are well suited for the purposes of collateral as they are designed to be less volatile than individual tokens. Moreover, we anticipate that users will hold ETF-like assets over longer time periods than others, making them more attractive as collateral on platforms that permit them to be used as such.
In short: by adding DEFI5 to Aave on Polygon, newcomers will be able to experience the magic of buying a high-performing DeFi index, depositing it on Aave and taking a loan against it.

Specifications

What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?
I am a full-time member of the core team of Indexed Finance, which produced DEFI5.

Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token.
DEFI5 is one of - at present - six ETF offerings by Indexed Finance, a passive portfolio management protocol. DEFI5 is governed by the Indexed DAO, which has the ability to vote on the membership of a ‘candidate list’ of assets under consideration for inclusion on a four-weekly reindexing cycle.
Weightings of assets within DEFI5 are determined on-chain by a square-root FDV scoring strategy utilizing TWAPs from a Uniswap V2 oracle. After three weekly reweightings (which are adjusted by updating oracle prices for all currently active assets and then updating the target weights of the underlying AMM), a reindexing occurs which considers the FDVs of all candidates, removing and adding active members from the wider list as necessary.
Assets are shifted towards their target weights via incremental shifts as swaps occur between assets in the underlying AMM: the details of which are available here.

Explain positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?
The current active members of DEFI5 are UNI, AAVE, COMP, CRV and MKR (SNX was recently removed by a reindex, and is being gradually phased out by arbitrage via external market forces). These are all blue-chip DeFi assets that are already used as collateral on many lending platforms.

Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?
As one of the initial ETF offerings produced by Indexed Finance upon the latter’s launch, DEFI5 is a ‘core’ ETF governed by the Indexed DAO, rather than a project in it’s own right: however, assets within the pool are wholly owned by holders of the DEFI5 token rather than Indexed.
Since DEFI5 is - insofar as performance goes - at a remove from the goings-on at Indexed itself, the technical challenges faced by the latter are unremarkable in the context of this initial pitch. Happy to talk about them though, if anyone’s interested!
Nonetheless, the Indexed protocol currently has a FDV of US$92 million (circulating market capitalization of US$31 million), and 5,316 members within its DAO.

How is the asset currently used?
As you’d expect, DEFI5 is currently being used as an asset for exposure to the wider DeFi sector without needing to pick a favourite.
It is currently available as a collateral asset on the Ruler protocol (whereupon it quickly reached the highest borrow-to-loan ratio of any asset listed there on launch day), and incentivized by Quickswap as a trading asset (as referenced above).

Emission schedule
Due to its underlying nature as an AMM LP token (see Technical Specifications below), DEFI5 does not have an emission schedule, and similarly does not have a maximum supply. DEFI5 tokens can be minted by either directly providing the underlying tokens in the appropriate amounts, or by utilizing the Uniswap router on the Indexed Finance website to purchase the underlying tokens in the appropriate amounts via ETH.
Similarly, DEFI5 tokens can be burned back to their underlying assets at any point: reducing the DEFI5 supply, but returning the NAV of the token to the burner.

Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?
DEFI5 currently has proxy upgradability, subject to a successful Governor Alpha vote from holders of NDX, the Indexed Finance protocol governance token.

Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens
DEFI5 was deployed on 6 December 2020 via this transaction.
At the time of writing, there are 1,083 holders after 19,593 transactions.

Technical Specifications
Indexed Finance uses AMM liquidity pools as the portfolio structure of its current suite of ETFs. DEFI5 is - in practice - an LP token representing a holders’ share in the assets of a forked Balancer pool.
The primary changes made by the fork enabled more dynamic pool management so that assets can be bound, rebound and reweighed gradually and without the need to access external liquidity. For more technical detail, see the Indexed docs starting from the Protocol section.
If there are any questions that arise which the reader feels are not addressed there - please let us know here, and we’ll both answer them here and update the documentation appropriately.

Security Considerations
A rogue action from the DAO can - with a governance vote - add nonsense tokens to the candidate list. Assuming that this was done ‘just in time’ for a scheduled reindexing, this could result in valuable assets being removed in favour of less desirable assets, albeit slowly: the shift is not immediate, but a gradual process (as can be seen by the fact that DEFI5 currently has six elements in it - SNX is being removed in favour of MKR).
With that said, the Indexed Governor Alpha contract that owns the core controller which administers the core pools (including DEFI5) is a significant mitigating factor against such an attack. The two day timelock imposed upon successful votes prior to their execution allows us enough time to warn holders to burn their DEFI5 tokens back into their underlyings before the reindex in the event that such a hostile vote succeeds.
We do not foresee such an action taken against a core pool as ‘likely’ - it is far more probable that a hostile attack on the Indexed DAO would involve an assault on the treasury and the NDX tokens therein, which would not affect DEFI5 in any way.

A Final Aside
There’s a question about Lindyness to address related to the figures given in the Market Data section above, since DEFI5 is - in and of itself - quite a young asset, which would typically preclude it from being included on Aave as collateral.
Nonetheless, the design of DEFI5 is such that it includes the heaviest hitters from DeFi, which - almost by default - include the longest-lasting/most Lindy protocols. Moreover, the upgradable asset list and reindexing procedure ensures that in the event that an active component does die out, it is replaced within the ETF by another blue-chip asset (itself likely to be Lindy). As a result, we consider DEFI5 to have ‘inherited’ a degree of the longevity of its components.
Even in the event that the Indexed DAO is wiped out and no further rebalancing or reindexing occurs, external market forces will still be incentivized through arbitrage to keep the current target weights in check.",29,1345.8,2021-05-01

['Aave Protocol V1 -> V2 migration tool and transition plan'],"Aave V2 was launched on Dec 3 and has shown exceptional resiliency. No particular issues were found during the launch, and after 40 days is now securely holding 500 Millions of fund and already issued 10M in flashloans, mostly thanks to the repay with collateral and swap features. Users in V2 enjoy these new possibilities and substantially lower gas prices. Now that V2 has shown enough resiliency to safely hold a sizeable amount of funds, the genesis team thinks it’s time to start the transition from Aave V1 to Aave V2. The first step is to release the official V1 -> V2 migration tool. This tool will be integrated in the Aave V1 UI and provide the ability to V1 users to safely migrate their whole position in one transaction. To reduce gas costs, the migration tool supports the CHI token.
The genesis team believes that the best strategy to have a seamless migration is the following:
Phase 1: Release the migration tool; submit a governance proposal to disable  borrowing of the less used stablecoins and all the collateral assets in Aave V1.
An initial list of assets disabled might be:

BUSD
SUSD
All the collateral assets

Phase 2: Submit a governance proposal to disable borrowing on:

DAI
USDC
USDT

Phase 3: Submit a governance proposal to freeze the stablecoins reserves. Freezed reserves will allow users to withdraw/repay/liquidate, but not borrow or deposit.
Phase 4: Freeze all the collateral reserves. Users will not be allowed to deposit more collateral, which means they will be required to migrate.
The idea behind this migration schedule is to progressively lower the borrow demand in V1 in order to replenish the stablecoins reserves. This way integrators like Curve/Yearn/idle/mstable and others will have the possibility to migrate their liquidity to the new version of the protocol.
The whole migration process should be relatively short to bring Aave V2 to full operation as soon as possible. The team believes that a period of two weeks for each phase (which includes 3 days of voting + 1 day timelock) should conclude the migration in approximately two months, which is a reasonable amount of time for users and integrators to properly act.",106,4731.2,2021-01-14

['Aave Protocol V1 -> V2 migration tool and transition plan'],"In my opinion, this plan is far too accelerated and would hurt Aave and its users if executed in this form in the near future. It is not a matter of only the technical readiness, but also economic and tax concerns that can deter suppliers, reducing the liquidity for everyone.
The value of ETH and many tokens have risen greatly in the past few months. Nearly all of the deposits on Aave have occurred in the past 12 months. In the US, the safe tax view is that deposits to Aave are taxable events (as token to aToken trades). I believe that it is also reasonable to consider v1 to v2 migration as a taxable event unless we hear otherwise because the two systems are completely separate and access different markets… it’s not just an upgrade of code or a swap analogous to a stock split like LEND to AAVE.
This means that if a US person or entity (and probably other jurisdictions as well) migrates from Aave v1 to Aave v2, they will immediately incur the higher short-term capital gains tax on the difference in value from when they deposited the collateral to the time when the migration takes place. This means basically immediately paying income tax on that difference, which is likely a large percentage of the collateral value.
One important use case for suppliers is the ability to postpone taxes by depositing collateral and borrowing against it, then slowly selling the collateral on their own schedule. By proceeding to phase 4 within a matter of weeks, making it impossible for them to deposit more collateral to maintain a healthy safety ratio, we are effectively forcing them to migrate immediately and incur a huge tax bill. In the announcements, it’s made to sound like you can take as long as you want to migrate, no rush. But this is simply not true if you have a large borrow. You can’t continue on the way you were before with the same level of risk and you may be forced to migrate or be liquidated. Either way you’re at risk of incurring a big surprise tax bill at any time.
I think a foundational part of DeFi like Aave should provide stability and predictability. Giving people notice that they’re effectively forced to migrate their positions and incur a huge tax bill within a matter of weeks is not that.
I think that everyone on Aave would be hurt if suppliers in the future are turned off from depositing into Aave because we establish a track record of rapidly deprecating its services on a timeframe too short for a financial platform. It makes me wonder if Aave v3 is going to come in a year, requiring another taxable event aToken migration.

['Aave Protocol V1 -> V2 migration tool and transition plan'],"This is a good question and I haven’t thought extensively about an ideal schedule for everyone. But my quick take on this…
I think that it would be reasonable for the disabling of borrowing over 2-3 months, so that anyone depending on borrowing from Aave in the short-term can continue for a while longer while planning the change over. Then delay the disabling of depositing to start in 8-12 months, so that anyone who wants to can maintain their collateral ratio at least until most people have switched over to long-term capital gains or had ample time to plan a change.
I would love to see what other people think as well, and I would like to better understand the tradeoffs of operating two systems in parallel. Is the main concern for having a speedy migration making sure as much liquidity is available as possible in a single new system so that it is more useful, for example for large flash loans? Are there other risks, like maintaining two systems takes a lot more effort, or may confuse users, etc?
Also I just want to give a quick example that might help illustrate why the migration is very difficult for some people tax-wise and what the timeframe looks like. Imagine someone spent their life savings of $100,000 to buy ETH on March 17, 2020 at $125, getting them 800 ETH. They immediately deposited into Aave. Fast forward to now and it’s worth over $900,000. They’ve been using Aave to borrow USDC to pay for their rent, so they can stay invested in ETH and not have to pay any taxes immediately.
Now if they have to execute the migration within the next few weeks while the gains are still short-term, the $800,000 difference between what they paid for the ETH and what it’s worth now would immediately become taxable at income tax rates in the US. Suddenly they have to pay almost $300,000 in taxes this year.
Before having to migrate, they didn’t have any immediate taxes to pay. They could’ve slowly sold off over several years. Now they suddenly have a $300,000 tax bill. They don’t have that much USD, so they either half to sell 37.5% of their ETH to pay it, or borrow $300,000. Both of these put them in a financially worse or riskier situation. They are surprised because they didn’t think that just months after depositing into Aave, the system would be deprecated.",51,70.2,2021-01-29

Optional LP Share Withdrawals Governance


    Automatic LP share withdrawal into wallets is sub-optimal (i.e. when depositing LINK, you receive aLINK). This could be construed as a token swap, which potentially carries tax considerations - instead of being viewed as posting collateral for a loan as you would with a centralized borrow/lend counterparty, which carries no tax obligation.

['Proposal: Introduce Liquidity Incentives for Aave v2'],"Background:
Aave has grown from $0 to $5 billion+ in total liquidity in just over a year. This growth has impressively been achieved without any liquidity incentives.
In fall 2020, Aave V2 was launched on mainnet and the LEND token was migrated to the new AAVE token. 3MM of the 16MM AAVE token supply has been allocated to the Aave Ecosystem Reserve, managing the distribution of safety and ecosystem incentives. In September 2020, AIP-1 passed, kickstarting the Safety Module and distributing 400 AAVE per day to stakers. In January 2021, AIP-7 passed, activating AAVE slashing and increasing the safety incentives to 550 AAVE per day. 20% of the fully-diluted AAVE supply is currently staked.
As described in the Aavenomics paper, the Aave community can vote to distribute liquidity incentives from the Ecosystem Reserve.
Proposal:
The intent of this RFC is to open up the discussion among the community to explore a liquidity mining (LM) program that optimizes for the long term growth of Aave. We believe that a well designed LM program can accomplish the following (as discussed in more detail below):

Grow lending and borrowing activity in targeted markets
Further decentralize/expand the AAVE token holder base
Incentivize v1 to v2 migration
Increase long-term pools of capital via stkAAVE distribution

Below is a rough sketch of ideas to consider. We invite the community to comment and vote below on the general idea of a LM program.
Liquidity Mining Benefits:
Grow lending and borrowing activity: With almost every major DeFi protocol launching a liquidity mining program, we believe it would be advantageous for Aave to utilize part of the Ecosystem Reserve to drive lending and borrowing activity across markets. Distributing AAVE to borrowers and lenders acts as an added incentive to attract more capital. The distribution can become more targeted over time. For example, certain markets may need more AAVE than others based on liquidity, utilization, and maturity of the market.
1346×520
Broader distribution and protocol decentralization: Rewarding AAVE to users of the protocol improves the distribution of the AAVE token. This gets AAVE into the hands of more users, further decentralizing the protocol.
Deprecating Aave v1: Due to high gas fees and a lack of incentive to migrate, Aave v1 still contains approximately 60% of the value locked in the broader Aave protocol. By introducing liquidity mining rewards only provided on Aave v2, liquidity providers and borrowers will naturally migrate toward the optimized version. Declining liquidity on Aave v1 will facilitate a gradual deprecation of this iteration of the protocol, allowing more development activity to be directed at Aave v2.
Liquidity Mining Design Commentary:
We would like to open up the discussion among the community to explore introducing liquidity mining incentives:
Distribution: We (ParaFi) propose a distribution of 550 Staked AAVE (stkAAVE) per day split 50-50 between lenders (275) and borrowers (275). We have considered various splits but, for now, have decided to go with an equal split for this pilot liquidity mining program.
This distribution is in line with the daily staking rewards and equates to 200,750 stkAAVE distributed per year or $103MM ($513.2/AAVE) in annualized rewards to borrowers/lenders at current prices (excluding any additional staking yield). From a supply perspective, this distribution results in only 1.25% of the fully diluted AAVE supply released each year. From a dollar value and token percentage standpoint, 550 stkAAVE/day remains significantly lower than comparable DeFi platforms. We believe the community will increase the LP distribution over time to become in line with other LM programs.
However, this allows the community to appropriately scale the distribution based on market dynamics and user activity. We have seen new DeFi protocols overpay for liquidity in the short-run and underpay for liquidity in the long-run. A relatively lower distribution to start leaves the ecosystem reserve with enough resources to scale up/down the allocation to users. If 550 stkAAVE/day is low based on liquidity and utilization, the community can vote to increase the distribution. A healthy portion of the reserve still remains for other critical areas (i.e rewarding integrations, grants, audits, etc).
Targeted Markets:
Given the number of markets on Aave, we see value in rewarding a handful of markets to start through a targeted distribution. The goal of this distribution is to increase borrow volume, pool utilization, and overall fees generated for the protocol. Over time, the community can vote to reward more markets.
For the initial distribution, we propose the following markets should be included:

USDC
USDT
DAI
GUSD
sUSD
TUSD
ETH
WBTC

Pro-Rata Distribution and stkAAVE Rewards
550 Staked AAVE (stkAAVE) per day will be allocated pro-rata across supported markets based on the dollar value of the borrowing activity in the underlying market.
This distribution strategy rewards markets based on borrow demand. Markets with higher dollar value borrowed receive a higher share of the daily stkAAVE rewards.
stkAAVE will be rewarded instead of AAVE to align long-term incentives, disincentivize speculative farmers, and allow users to earn an underlying yield on top of the AAVE they earn. This helps align LPs by giving them more governance weight upfront and secure the protocol by increasing the amount of AAVE staked in the Safety Module. LPs then immediately earn a staking yield on their vested AAVE.
stkAAVE requires a 10 day cooldown period. The cooldown period must be started before LPs can unstake their AAVE. After the cooldown period, users have a 2 day window to unstake. By distributing rewards in stkAAVE, borrowers and lenders are immediately aligned with the protocol, increasing the security stake while earning a yield on their AAVE rewards.
875×517
This cooldown period indirectly serves as a vesting component for LP rewards. In Compound’s liquidity mining program, Gauntlet stated a “large fraction of COMP holders are selling all of their earnings and not staying long-term holders.” We have seen this dynamic take place in a number of DeFi protocols post-launch. By implementing stkAAVE rewards, we naturally mitigate this suboptimal outcome. If need be, the community can vote to implement a vesting component for stkAAVE (i.e LPs receive ½ stkAAVE upfront, receive ½ stkAAVE in 6 months).
There is room to increase the daily AAVE distribution based on the number of markets, liquidity levels, and utilization. Over time, the LP rewards can be used to bootstrap liquidity in new markets and encourage new assets to be onboarded.
Any distribution schedule can be reviewed on a quarterly basis.

['Proposal: Introduce Liquidity Incentives for Aave v2'],"Hi,
I have to admit that this is the very first time I am not happy with a proposal. The problem we all saw with LM was a quick shift from one into another protocol like we saw last summer. The result was that the protocol skyrocketed on TVL but after a while the price crashed extremely fast.
If you still want LM, then there should be some more security/ features implemented to counter this kind of action.
For example the only thing, stopping people from doing so and taking their liquidity and dump their farmed token is the cool down period. But what if something else would be implemented? Like a multiplier. Meaning if someone stays longer in the pool, he will get more token based on the multiplier. So instead of 10 days CD, it could be 90 , 180 and 365 days where each mark would increase the multiplier.
Another option would be if people leave the pool quite fast a burning could happen. For example you have to stay some time in the pool to get no burning at all. And this could be set in stages. 10 days = 20% burning, 30 days = 10% burning, 60 days = no burning at all.
I think you get the point. It is important to inboard new LP to stay longterm and not just get in with huge amounts, farm everything, dump it and leave.",133,196.6,2021-02-06

['Proposal: Introduce Liquidity Incentives for Aave v2'],"I’m strongly against the proposal for a few reasons:


It doesn’t make much sense to incentivise migration → this will set a bad precedent where every time a new version of the protocol comes up,  LPs will expect some sort of incentive before they migrate. Rather, the new version should be “so good” such that liquidity providers will want to migrate to take advantage of the new protocol.


stAAVE distribution does not really help incentivize long-term holding as 10 days is way too short and cannot possibly be considered long term in anyway. SNX escrow period is 1 year, and Sushi swap liquidity mining vested 2/3rds of the rewards after 3 months.


Running liquidity mining programs after the protocol has been live and successful for such a long-time feels like a step backwards, especially if the plan is to incentivise the current existing pools which are working along just fine. There is a reason why uniswap themselves decided to stop their liquidity mining program, and yet their growth is coming along just fine.


I think it will make more sense for the protocol to focus on bridging to real-world assets, and perhaps giving out AAVE to incentivise people to build out peripheral protocols that connect AAVE to real-world assets.
As an aside, a more effective liquidity mining programme would to just incentivise the demand side (so we can give out half the amount of tokens). Incentivise demand will push up interest rates sky high, and supply will follow. This is way more effective than compounds liquidity mining programme. If we were to incentivise demand and supply, that would kind of be like an Curve giving out governance tokens to people who make swaps on the protocol.",116,258.2,2021-02-06

We generally feel that crypto lending (WBTC, ETH) and stablecoin borrowing (USD) are the most natural demand today (and likely in the future) and will occur naturally without any incentives (given a host of reasons – borrowing a non-appreciating asset to maximize returns via leverage and/or farming, delay selling for tax purposes, etc)


On the other hand, crypto borrowing is more opportunistic (mostly for farming) and stablecoin lending today is typically unnatural for crypto-natives. To wit, the latter would forgo potentially sizable crypto returns – and such a group may pertain mostly to (a) crypto credit funds and/or (b) non-crypto-natives looking for high-yield.


Therefore, we tend to believe that more aggressively incentivizing stablecoin lending would be the “most bang for the buck” to maximize LTV / CAC for Aave’s inflation:
— lowest stablecoin borrow naturally attracts borrowers
— similarly, lowest borrow naturally attrends crypto collateral lenders
— with more crypto collateral lenders, crypto borrowing may come at lower rate which attracts demand upon opportunistic farming opportunities.
— all such measures would ensure the TVL : borrowed ratio stays high and efficient.


Therefore, as an idea, we suggest Aave to consider for example directing most if not all of the 550 AAVE token towards stablecoin lending only across [USDC, USDT, DAI, GUSD], with opportunistic allocation too secondary stables such as [sUSD, TUSD, UST, etc]. The allocation should also be negotiated heavily with the stablecoin-issuer  – with the anticipation of more aggressive assistance / integration / synergistic steps. For instance, a big allocation of AAVE to GUSD lender would almost certainly help adoption of GUSD – Aave should thereby ask for priviledged treatment across Gemini #DeFi business development efforts.


We generally support longer lock-up of rewards and thereby support a vesting similar to 1/2 10 day + 1/2 6 month. We also feel like an option of accelerated vest should be available for (a) paying a say 10% cost to vest-all, the 10% is burned, and/or (b) tailor vesting schedule to the amount of TVL / borrowing provided.

['Proposal: Introduce Liquidity Incentives for Aave v2'],"Hey everybody, i’m usually a lurker here on the forum but i believe this topic is really important so i decided to jump in.
although i’m not against liquidity mining, these numbers look more like an attempt to pump the tvl/bring fake borrowing volume rather than cultivating actual organic growth.
First of all i would remove from the list TUSD, GUSD, SUSD, BUSD, WBTC and ETH. ETH/WBTC borrowing is a limited usecase and incentivizing it would only bring fake outstanding debt,
which might be good to bring more fees but not now with a migration in process.
GUSD, SUSD, BUSD and TUSD have limited use in defi (even though sUSD is mostly used on synthetix), their total supply is rater low and it would essentially waste the emission to reward relatively unproductive assets.
I think the protocol would be better off rewarding only DAI/USDT/USDC for the first quarter, for the following reasons:


there is currently 370M of outstanding debt on Aave V1 on DAI, USDC and USDT. Borrowers on V1 are reluctant to migrate because liquidity on V2 is taken very quicky, borrow rates are high and the migration is damn expensive (i’m a borrower on V1 myself and i need to spend 700$ to migrate, with the current V2 borrowing rates it’s just not worth it). At the same time V1 borrowers are experiencing high gas costs and cannot leverage the new V2 features, which bring bad user experience.


the remaining outstanding debt is mostly ETH, WBTC and SNX. V2 can easily cover the needs for these borrowers to migrate, since there is plenty of ETH/WBTC liquidity and rates are even better in V2 right now.


Since as you are saying in the proposal Aave can’t compete with compound/other protocols in terms of liquidity mining APY, the Liquidity mining program needs to be as targeted as possible
to facilitate real growth of the ecosystem and onboard everyone on the latest iteration of the protocol.


For that reason if we bump the emission a little bit to 650 AAVE/day splitted across 3 currencies (DAI, USDC, USDT) instead 9 and with a ratio of 80% LPs/20% borrowing, there would be the following situation:
Let’s imagine a price of 400$/AAVE, which is a fair bit below the current market price but it’s closer to the average of the last two weeks;

Let’s consider DAI:
With your proposal, LPs would get 30.5 AAVE/day. At 400$/AAVE, that’s 4.453M year. Considering the current V2 reserve size of 74M, that’s 6% APY. Compound DAI APY is 5.9% APY. I fail to see how this emission will attract any meaningful additional liquidity, especially considering there is the need of 63M more DAI just to cover the debt on v1 for the migration. The eventual leverage doesn’t help either, because people leveraging will just drive the supply/borrowing APY up, which might attract more liquidity yes, but at the same time will keep the borrowing rates high, disincentivizing organic borrowers (ie borrowers that borrow on Aave to use the funds elsewhere). This is exactly what’s happening on Compound: People might think that for real borrowers it’s always better to borrow on Compound because you get paid for it, but that’s actually false: right now for example there is a 6% subsidy in COMP, but the borrowing rate is 13%: Borrowers that don’t leverage pay 7%, and that’s MORE than Aave V2 WITHOUT borrowing incentives. This is the result of the crazy leveraging happening in their protocol. Moreover, entities that can’t leverage (think for example of liquidity coming from curve pools) would have little to no reason to move to V2.
With my proposal, DAI LPs would get 31.6M$ in AAVE a year. With the 74M currently in V2, that’s nearly 50% APY. If we imagine that the APY settles around the one of compound, thats 10 times more liquidity than what’s available in V2 right now. Aave V2 would have the cheapest DAI lending rates on the market by far, which would drive up organic growth. At the same time, borrowers will get 43 AAVE/day, which is 6.3M/year, so on 120M outstanding debt for example the reward APY from borrowing would still be 5%, lower than compound but coupled with the high stablecoin liquidity, it means that organic borrowers actually earn from borrowing (as i mentioned before, the same can’t be said for compound unless you leverage: an “organic” borrower on compound right now still has to pay around 7% a year, that is the difference between the subsidized 6% and the borrowing APY of 13%)
Same reasoning can be of course applied to USDC and USDT. These three currently drive the growth of the defi space, so that’s what needs to be incentivized the most, i have no doubt about it.
That would be, of course, for the first quarter - if it does not work, can be changed and/or other assets can be added.
So that’s it - you have my opinion, the community can do whatever they want with it. I really hope we take the path of incentivizing organic growth rather than bringing useless farming volume - i really want to migrate to v2 :)",118,163.6,2021-02-07

Hi everyone!
I’m @nettra, I’ve been following Aave for about a year, bought some Aave tokens, and in these past months have really enjoyed the community calls, and the other community events by the Aave team on Clubhouse, Zoom and Youtube.
Although it was not a community call, I did attend a cool call superbly moderated by @heyerikan, featuring Lirona, the artist. I was super pleased to see that the Aave team was able to attract someone like Erika to host the event: she broke down concepts in a very relatable way [1]. These open community events are key and I’d love to have more.
I want to commend the Aave team and Erika for:

speaking plain English at this event
talking about helpful use cases
talking about fun use cases
offering people like me, who want to learn more about crypto (and about Aave in particular), a fun, informative and educational opportunity to engage.

Ultimately, I think these community events are going to be necessary to fully activate the community that already exists around Aave, to grow this community, and to eventually bring crypto to the mainstream. Why should we care about that? Because crypto can solve real-world problems and create a lot of joy. We have a lot of problems and like joy!
I’d love to see more of this and so in the spirit of community, I’m going to  volunteer myself as a (co-)host of these community calls.
There. I just did it 
I can share some key updates about Aave and field questions from the community. I understand enough tech to answer basic questions with just enough detail that the answer stays simple and memorable . More importantly, I know enough tech to understand my limits and what questions I need to investigate further.
I like learning by talking and listening. I like learning about new projects. I already do this weekly in my Club on Clubhouse called Crypto Beyond Currency [2]. I like understanding what questions people have on their mind. Actually holding Office Hours is one of my favorite parts of my day job teaching/researching purpose-driven innovation.

['ARC include sUSD in AAVE liquidity mining'],"Discussion
sUSD liquidity on AAVE is thin compared to other stablecoins due to the facts that;

its not enabled as a collateral asset
not included in the current liquidity mining program

In regards to 1), we are in the process of submitting an AIP with the necessary proposition power to meet PROPOSITION_THRESHOLD for Executor(short), to enable sUSD as collateral.
This ARC is aimed at raising a discussion around 2), and the idea of being more inclusive with sUSD in AAVE liquidity mining and the lending protocol as a whole.
sUSD has been on AAVE for a long time now and has a proven record of liquidity even in extremely volatile market conditions. There have been some instances of peg deviation from $1 USD but the depth of sUSD liquidity and the low interest rates of multi-collateral loans (currently 2%) make the peg risks lower than they have ever been.
The Synthetix community feels that they deserves to take part in this opportunity to mine AAVE with synths, given Synthetix’s major role in the defi landscape and the massive amount of Synth liquidity in Curve.fi (which supports an sAAVE pool). We expect AAVE liquidity mining to bring major attention to the DeFi space and its an equally good opportunity to spotlight a fully decentralized-collateral backed stable coin $sUSD, in the process. It is no secret there is major overlap between the AAVE and SNX communities and the inclusion of sUSD in the liquidity mining program is mutually beneficial for Aave markets, Synthetix and the DeFi ecosystem as a whole.
Specifications
No changes to the reward supply for the current liquidity mining program are being proposed in this ARC. The only change being proposed is the addition of sUSD to the current rewards distribution strategy for the stable coin market (50/50 allocation to lenders/borrowers, based on borrow demand).
For a technical reference to this ARC please read: ARC: enable sUSD as collateral

"['Listing Proposal: xSDT on Aave Polygon Market, by Stake DAO']","Hello AAVEngers,
We, the contributors at Stake DAO, would like to propose that our yield-bearing token, xSDT, is listed on AAVE’s Polygon marketplace as a collateral asset. We believe having xSDT on AAVE would open the door to several mutually beneficial and exciting opportunities for both AAVE and Stake DAO.

audits both procedural and smart contract focused: The Stake DAO contracts have been built and tested with the highest standards, but they have not been audited. The Stake DAO contributors have extensive experience building and auditing smart contracts.

Paragraph Summary
xSDT is the yield-bearing asset of the Stake DAO ecosystem, most similar to the xSushi token within the Sushi ecosystem. The xSDT token therefore benefits from the Stake DAO fees and increases in value against the underlying SDT token.
Due to its design, xSDT makes for a great collateral to borrow against. Allowing xSDT as a collateral asset on AAVE provides an additional utility to the Stake DAO community, benefits the AAVE platform with additional liquidity (TVL), and provides the opportunity of earning fees on borrowed assets with xSDT as collateral.
In terms of the immediate impact of providing support for xSDT on AAVE, Stake DAO would quickly attract a significant number of new users to the AAVE platform through its sizable and loyal community (known as The Herd). The Herd is closely aligned with the AAVE community in their vision of DeFi and have expressed strong interest in collateralizing their assets through AAVE.
One of the key strengths of Stake DAO is the capacity to build safe strategies, which is why ; assuming xSDT is approved on AAVE, the DAO will create a strategy allowing users to deposit xSDT which will be then deposited into AAVE to safely borrow stablecoins. The Stake DAO infrastructure is designed to behave safely and will ensure that the position is not liquidated, gatekeeping the safety of AAVE.
In the long term, Stake DAO will work to aid AAVE in the mission to onboard new users into DeFi, aided by its native fiat-to-crypto onramp and native email-based onboarding.
Retail users will drive the next wave of DeFi adoption, and we look forward to accelerating this process by giving new users an even easier way to supply liquidity to Polygon, AAVE, and our upcoming v2.
Motivation
Short description of the proposed technical solution
A core motivation of Stake DAO is to democratise access to DeFi, building tools and features that make it easier than ever for new crypto users to participate. By incorporating email login functionality with a fiat on-ramp, simple token staking, and access to a range of investment strategies into one easy-to-use dashboard, we are offering the most intuitive entry point into DeFi, encouraging more people to take control of their assets and advancing the adoption of open finance. Users can seamlessly purchase a range of crypto assets from within the Stake DAO portal including ETH, DAI, and USDC, directly from their bank account or debit card with EUR, GBP, or USD, providing a seamless on-ramp to DeFi and the broader crypto economy. These assets can then be swapped in a couple of clicks into any one of the hundreds of tokens available through Stake DAO Swap.
Specifications
1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?
The authors of the AIP is a group of Stake DAO contributors.
2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token
Stake DAO offers an intuitive solution to the complexity and fragmentation of the DeFi (decentralised finance) ecosystem, allowing anyone — with any level of knowledge of crypto — to have easy access to the market’s most competitive products and strategies. With Stake DAO, users can earn additional rewards choosing from the highest-yielding products, strategies, and staking blockchains, and seamlessly accessing them from our user-friendly portal.
3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?
Why xSDT on Aave matters

SDT and xSDT have true utility (Strategy fees, Staking fees, The Sanctuary exchange token), and xSDT is one of the most liquid assets today on Polygon L2 (via ComethSwap).
Upcoming synergies between AAVE (Project & token), strategies, and more.
Integrations with other important Polygon projects such as AAVE and Comethswap.
Upcoming integration and staking services of Polygon directly from the Stake DAO platform.
Native onboarding of retail onto DeFi with direct on-ramp and integrated trustless email log-ins.

Benefits for Aave

Additional liquidity and token opportunities on Layer2 for the AAVE Polygon Market.
Aave would be the first platform to support xSDT, a yield-bearing asset.
Future collaboration with Stake DAO ecosystem of products and partners.
Support of a Polygon-native project with incentivised liquidity on Polygon.
Support a community-led project.

4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are the live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?
The idea of Stake DAO arose in 2018, the development happened mostly in 2020 and the DAO was launched in January 2021 with 4 strategies currently live.
5. How is the asset currently used?
xSDT Tokenomics
SDT is the governance token of Stake DAO, earned by users who deposit their tokens into the DAO. SDT tokens are disbursed to all users in proportion to the fees that their deposit generated for the DAO. SDT holders can then stake their earned SDT to receive xSDT.
xSDT automatically earns all fees imposed by the Stake DAO platform — the 15% performance fee on all strategies, and up to 0.5% in withdrawal fees, effectively producing yield for users staking their SDT. In the future, xSDT will earn from additional revenue streams including staking, additional strategies, and more.
xSDT currently yields around 30-40% APY with over 13m$ locked in the Sanctuary, making it an ideal productive asset as collateral. Finally, xSDT enables its holders to participate in DAO governance, a critical function of the Stake DAO ecosystem.
6. Emission schedule
The current emission schedule is 5 SDT/block as protocol incentives, which is controlled through the DAO’s governance.
7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability
The xSDT token can only be minted by depositing SDT inside the Sanctuary contract.
The SDT token can only be minted by the masterchef contract as rewards to governance participants.

Risk Assessment

1600×220

SDT Smart contract Risk: C+
SDT was launched in January. The SDT to xSDT contract is a modified version of the Sushibar contract from Sushiswap, an approved asset on AAVE. The other key contracts on Stake DAO are industry standards, which have either been audited or control multi-billion in TVL. Due to the fact that no audit was performed on the Stake DAO smart contracts, we are giving a score of C+, but we expect that the fair grade would be higher.
SDT Counterparty Risk: B-
Stake DAO is a permissionless blockchain protocol where token holders vote on incentives and upgrades. The number of holders could be higher, which is why we are assigning a higher than average centralisation risk.
SDT Market Risk: C-
SDT has an average market capitalisation with a high volume with respect to its market cap, with approximately the entire market cap being traded on a monthly basis. The price has suffered from some volatility since inception, hence the C- overall grade.

['Proposal: directly incentivize usage of the v2 mirgation portal'],"Hi everyone,
this proposal can be seen as an extension or alternative to the ongoing discussion about the liquidty mining proposal: Proposal: introduce liquidity incentives for aave v2
The Goal is Aave V2
Besides the positive growth effect on the TVL, the one other main purpose of a potentional liquidity mining campaign should be to incentivize users to switch from AVVE v1 to AAVE v2.
In that case, incentives should be a close as possible to this action.
The migration problem
Besides a couple of cool function and slightly better rates, user have now real incentive to migrate their position from v1 to v2. Even worse, in the recent enviorment of high fee user will punish themself with costs.
This especially it true form smaller user.
The idea
Instead of incentivizing borrowing and lending on v2, I would like to propose to directly incentivize the migration from v1 to v2 by using the migration portal of aave.com.
An idea could be to give the user a certain percentage of the capital he/she migrates to v2 back in AAVE token. I would like to leave the exact number to the discussion.
The incentivation of usage of the migration portal (v1 => v2) will lead to the follow positiv effects:

More capital will migrate to v2 simply because user want the token
the reward token can compensate the TX costs of the migration which benefits small users.

In some way the idea it leaning on the recent move of balancer to incentives trading with BAL token to compensate TX fees.
potentional abuse
To avoid potentional abuse the followin restriction could be used:

Every ETH adress get rewards only ones. Not multiple rewards for multiple migrations
Only adresses who have capital in v1 by time / block XYZ are able to get rewards

please note: this is my very first proposal in general. :-) But I am very happy to share this idea with you. I’m looking forward to your thoughts.",15,73.0,2021-04-21

['Gauntlet Market Risk Primer'],"Background
At Gauntlet, we use agent-based simulations to evaluate the economic security of blockchain protocols. We have worked with the Aave team in parameter optimization for V2, which includes loan-to-value ratio (LTV), liquidation threshold, and liquidation incentive values for various assets. The main purpose of this post is to provide some color into the work we have been doing with the Aave team, as well as motivate the framework for high-level analysis that we will continue to perform. We purposely exclude the rigorous definitions and methodology for our simulations in this post, but that will be available in a formal report to be released shortly. With that said, we hope to illuminate and spark discussion about overall market and systemic risk within the Aave protocol.
Agent-Based Simulation
The main tool used for assessing market and system risk in Aave is agent-based simulation. Such simulations can accurately assess how well liquidations are handled under stressful scenarios, such as Black Thursday. Our simulation platform allows data scientists to directly stress test agent models (models of user behavior) against the real EVM bytecode that is used on mainnet. By stress testing against actual contract code, we reduce the surface area for false negative safety results.
To construct models of borrower, supplier, and liquidator behavior, we first analyze on-chain and market data. Using these models, we run Monte Carlo simulations of different users competing and interacting with the protocol to assess safety. Our methodology for stress testing DeFi protocols was established in our analyses of Compound and THORChain. For our analysis of Aave, we significantly improved the models used for analyzing borrower behavior in Compound. These model improvements allow us to handle cross-margining and better reflect multi-collateral borrowing behavior. This allows us to stress test the protocol’s safety under liquidity duress and more accurately handle the wide variety of assets utilized within Aave.
Key Simulation Inputs
Our simulations focus on stress-testing the protocol under extreme market conditions, including high volatility, low liquidity, and high gas congestion. The main levers available to the protocol to mitigate risk during these conditions are loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, liquidation threshold, and liquidation incentive. We also utilize these variables to help define and guide agent logic within the system. Our simulations allow for the isolation of specific changes to each of these values per asset.
LTV
This variable helps to define our borrower and lender logic. As we change LTV per asset, it changes the amount that can be borrowed against a particular collateral. For each asset, we also define how borrower behavior will change based on LTV changes.
Liquidation Threshold
The difference between the LTV and liquidation threshold of a particular asset is the minimum buffer for an adverse price movement that a loan can withstand. Changing liquidation threshold alters the amount of time that borrowers have to resupply collateral to maintain healthy loans.
Liquidation Incentive
This variable helps to define our liquidator agent logic. The main consideration for liquidators is balancing the slippage, trading fees, and transaction fees against the liquidation incentive. This provides the framework for defining optimal liquidator behavior.
Asset Volatility and Correlation
Historical data about price movements defines the price trajectories used in our simulations, but it also impacts how our liquidators behave. Changing liquidator behavior in times of high volatility and low liquidity can give insight to systemic risk. Another key aspect of our simulations is understanding asset correlation and its effects on protocol health. This is the correlation matrix of the assets on the Aave protocol over the from December 2020 to January 2021:

image817×773 78 KB

In our simulations, we are using correlated multi-asset geometric Brownian motion models for each of the asset price trajectories.
Network Congestion
Another key aspect of understanding how Aave will perform under high stress situations is network congestion. We add gas price and transaction delay implications by building gas distribution curves on three month trailing data, and use random samples in our liquidator logic. In addition, we fit expected transaction delay times to liquidation calls.
User Behavior
There are idiosyncratic risks for each asset that might be missed through general market statistics including volatility and liquidity. In addition to considering these general risks, we monitor borrow and lend behavior on a per asset level. Specifically, one metric is borrow usage rate per asset which can be defined as:

where U is the utilization ratio of each user:

This particular metric provides information about how aggressively suppliers of a specific asset borrow against their supply. At the time of this post, the total size of the V2 protocol is still less than 20% of V1, so we are currently utilizing V1 user behavior for our simulations, but this should change over time:

870×485

Key Simulation Outputs
The following metrics are a few ways that we monitor overall protocol health and safety throughout our simulations. These metrics guide how we make suggestions for the previously stated key protocol variables.
Insolvency
The main output used to determine overall protocol market risk is account insolvencies. Whenever an account holds more debt, or borrowed assets, than collateral, or supplied assets, the account can be considered to be insolvent. On the protocol level, we monitor the gross and net insolvent value of all assets. Because many users of Aave hold multi-asset debt as well as multi-asset collateral, we also look at the gross and net insolvent value per asset by using pro rata attributions of the insolvent debt.
Liquidation Values
One main mechanic that the Aave protocol utilizes to maintain the overall health of the protocol is liquidations. The total liquidated value and total liquidatable debt are valuable metrics. However, another important output is “adverse liquidations”. As explained in the OpenZeppelin audit of Aave [H08] Counterproductive incentives, there exist regimes where liquidations do not improve the overall health of a specific loan, but rather push it towards insolvency. During simulation runs, we track the changes to the volume and frequency of adverse liquidations, as well as the clustering of liquidations in terms of size. Increases in adverse liquidations places more onus on users to resupply collateral. Although insolvency statistics may not increase throughout some simulations, these metrics shed light into some hidden systemic risks.
Results
As previously mentioned, we have been working with the Aave team on working with parameter suggestions that can balance protocol safety and capital efficiency. In particular, two of the major suggestions that we made were decreasing risk limits on YFI and increasing risk limits on WBTC. In this particular set of simulation results, we do a sweep of LTV and liquidation threshold changes for YFI against various volatilities. For each of the parameter and volatility settings, we run 15 simulations with differing realized price trajectories and gas prices. In these simulations, we also shifted borrower behavior based on LTV and liquidation threshold changes. Below are plots of the total collateralization of the protocol, the net insolvent value of the protocol, and the net insolvent value of just YFI for the varying initial conditions for on-chain borrower data and market data from November 2020:

image828×702 25.9 KB


image818×703 22.7 KB


image825×710 24.7 KB

The volatility scalar is a multiplier applied to each of the asset volatilities used to generate correlated price trajectories. The risky asset borrow scalar is a multiplier that directly changes the reserve configurations for a particular asset (in this case YFI), as well as directly changing borrower behavior. The overall health of the protocol is maintained even when we increase the annualized volatility an order of magnitude larger than the trailing one month data at the time, which can be seen in the net insolvency value of around 1%. However, when analyzing just accounts holding YFI, there was substantial insolvency risk at extremely high volatility settings. This guided suggestions in lowering the liquidation threshold for YFI in Aave V2. In addition, note the transitions of the total collateralization of the entire protocol at the end of each set of simulation. As the borrow scalar increases, it follows that total collateralization should decrease at the beginning of each simulation. As volatility increases, there is a non-linear relationship with total collateralization. This is a result of the dependence of our liquidator logic on choice of collateral and liquidation value on market conditions. More specifically, there were particular LINK positions that were liquidatable more quickly in high volatility settings. When those liquidations happen more quickly, the removal of these risky positions leads to a higher collateralization value at the end of certain simulations, but as volatility continues to increase, the calculated slippage and market impact in our liquidator logic results in decisions to not liquidate these positions.
A similar set of simulations were run across WBTC LTV and liquidation threshold values. Total collateralization and net insolvency values were similar, but the WBTC net insolvency values were lower and more importantly, the impact of increasing LTV and liquidation threshold on insolvency was low:

image816×704 22.9 KB

Update
Parameter optimization is an on-going process. An important consideration for our liquidator logic is asset volatility and liquidity, and our simulations are run using the most recent market data. Given the increase in trading volume of YFI and lower market impact of large trades, the insolvency metric for YFI has decreased substantially in January 2021:

image831×708 23.1 KB

Next Steps
The report analyzing the protocol will be published in the near future and will formalize our findings in the context of protocol market risks and safety. As more data is available for V2, we will continue to fine-tune our simulations to changes in user behavior in the new protocol. In the future, we hope that our simulations can guide parameter changes to the Aave protocol by providing valuable insights into economic risks.

['Proposal: Add support for OGN'],"Origin Protocol (OGN) is a decentralized finance and commerce protocol working to eliminate the intermediaries. We recently launched an NFT platform that has attracted high profile buyers and sellers, including Jake Paul and Grammy Award-winning musicians. Origin also maintains OUSD, a yield-aggregating rebasing stablecoin.
OGN has deep liquidity and is listed on Binance (with futures and margin), Huobi (with margin), and Coinbase Pro.
Why this would be good for Aave
Origin has a large and active community that could help bring new users to Aave. The email list is over 250,000 strong. OGN have over 70,000 people in our various Telegram groups, as well as nearly 100,000 Twitter followers and nearly 500,000 members on Blockfolio Signal. OGN has a very strong presence in Asia with full-time employees focused on Korea and China as well as other Asian countries that are less familiar with Aave.
Origin has a suite of working products, a well-respected team, and a track record of shipping code. We’re long-term believers in this space and are deeply committed to the success of Aave and the broader ecosystem. We’re optimistic that DeFi will eventually attract the masses that borrow/lend in order to finance real-world commerce, such as the purchase of goods and services on Origin decentralized stores and marketplaces.
In addition, regardless of whether OGN is added as a supported asset on Aave and subsequent proposal, this process will be a strong example of how decentralized governance can work in action. Just like DeFi has composability, we believe decentralized governance should have composability, and this will be a great way to test the chaining of two governance votes together.
About Origin
Origin’s mission is to bring peer-to-peer commerce (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi) to the masses.
Origin was founded in mid-2017 in San Francisco and the 20-person team includes one of the founders of PayPal, the first engineer at YouTube, and former engineering managers from Google and Dropbox. Origin conducted token sales in 2017 and 2018, raising $38.1M, led by Pantera Capital with participation from Foundation Capital, Kyber, QCP Capital, and Alexis Ohanian (co-founder, Reddit), Steve Chen (founder, YouTube), and Garry Tan (partner, Y Combinator).
The Origin Marketplace is live on the Ethereum mainnet and our decentralized stores are used by many well-known players in the crypto community including Brave, Solana, Contentos and Kyber. OUSD has attracted millions of dollars in deposits and our first NFT auction netted nearly $12M for the creator.
About OGN
The Origin Token (OGN) is the governance and value accrual token for the entire Origin Platform and suite of products. OUSD is being transitioned into ownership by the community with OGN as the governance token.
OGN token holders will be able to create and vote on proposals to govern the underlying protocol. This may include:

Adding/removing new types of yield-earning strategies
Allocating capital across a basket of strategies
Determining what fees are charged by the protocol
Determining what incentives (e.g. OGN rewards for liquidity mining) are offered on an ongoing basis

Origin Tokens are being slowly released to presale investors, team members and advisors based on a gradual release schedule that’s available on the Binance Research report and the Origin’s Token dashboard .
Potential concerns
Liquidity
We recognize that liquidity is important for the security of the platform. OGN is currently listed on top exchanges like Binance, Huobi, and Coinbase Pro. Daily trading volume has ranged between $50M on the low end to $533M on the high end in recent weeks.
Other platforms
Composability is one of the most interesting parts of DeFi, and OGN is already available on other DeFi platforms like Cream, Uniswap, SushiSwap, Kyber and Balancer.
Security
Origin’s smart contacts have been audited by Trail of Bits. You can find their report and our responses to their findings here:

Reading time: 4 min read
Custom functionality
The OGN contract has a custom approveAndCallWithSender function that is based on ERC-827 that allows OGN to be approved and transferred to a whitelist of addresses in a single step. We added this function to improve the user experience for users of the Origin marketplace. While adding complexity, we do not believe it adds any security considerations for our token or the security of Compound.
Admin rights
The OGN contract is owned by a 5 of 8 Gnosis mutisig contract which has been audited by OpenZeppelin, ConsenSys, Origin’s team, and others. While we can’t reveal the identities of the keyholders for security reasons, we can share that the keys are held by individuals with close ties to the company. Our keyholders have been instructed to manually double-check every proposal for accuracy before granting approval. The keyholders are highly intelligent and ethical individuals. My cofounder, Matt, and I have known and worked with many of them for years and we trust them to protect the best interests of all token holders.
Like many other widely used tokens, we included the OpenZeppelin libraries that enable minting, burning and pausing. We included this functionality solely out of a desire to reserve optionality in an unknown future. We have no current plans to use it and have put careful processes in place to prevent both accidental and intentional abuse. Even as founders acting together, Matt and I do not have enough control to execute those owner functions on our own. We recognize that burning any externally owned tokens could do irreparable harm to our reputation and value of our token. As a result, this external burning capability would only be used under extreme circumstances and with community support.
While we’re not ready to revoke ownership of our token contract altogether as the network is still developing, we are open to adding a Compound-inspired timelock in front of any admin function calls if that will make a difference for the community.

['Proposal: add support for renFIL (Filecoin)'],"Hi Aave Fam, 
I’m Corbin from ConsenSys Codefi, and we’ve been working on getting a tokenized version of Filecoin (FIL) onto Ethereum mainnet using Ren Protocol (renFIL).
I’m proposing we add depositing and borrowing (not collateral) support for renFIL to the Aave market.
Filecoin brings decentralized storage to DeFi, and renFIL allows all types of new decentralized applications to be built to further the space:


 Storage mining syndicates

 Data markets

 Shared UIs/images/content

 Lossless capital hosting

But these applications need a robust lending market to thrive, so storage miners can borrow renFIL/FIL to stake and FIL holders can earn a yield on their holdings. Adding renFIL to Aave would unlock these new applications🔓, expose the Filecoin community to Aave📈, and create a large new market on the protocol🎉!
Ren Protocol was chosen as the tokenization service because it is already managing large bridges in production, including $301 million in renBTC as of this writing. Collateral support for renFIL may be added later, but we recommend waiting for more price stability of FIL and renFIL before enabling.
We’d love to get the community’s thoughts and feedback on this proposal! Thanks!
Filecoin Information
Project
Filecoin is a distributed storage network based on a blockchain mechanism. Filecoin miners can elect to provide storage capacity for the network, and thereby earn units of the Filecoin cryptocurrency (FIL) by periodically producing cryptographic proofs that certify that they are providing the capacity specified. In addition, Filecoin enables parties to exchange FIL currency through transactions recorded in a shared ledger on the Filecoin blockchain. Rather than using Nakamoto-style proof of work to maintain consensus on the chain, however, Filecoin uses proof of storage itself: a miner’s power in the consensus protocol is proportional to the amount of storage it provides.
Filecoin was founded in 2015 by Juan Benet, has been backed by Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, and Union Square Ventures, and its mainnet went live on October 15, 2020. The network is governed by the Filecoin Foundation and the Filecoin Foundation for Decentralised Web.

I’d be curious if Ren had a library that would allow would-be borrowers to natively borrow renFIL and convert it to FIL and send it directly to the borrower’s FIL wallet for use with mining.
I’m not sure if the RenJS library, which allows for native BTC deposits on Curve to convert to renBTC or wBTC and vice versa, would be capable of doing something similar for renFIL.

['Proposal: add support for renFIL (Filecoin)'],"What Marc is pointing out is very important and what I think will make supporting FIL in general successful in Aave.
There are three categories of users:

Storage users: users that have other assets and want to pay for storage using leverage products (e.g. a project betting on returns (or collateral capital valuation increase) that is higher than the FIL borrowing interest)
Miners: given the new Filecoin change, miners earn ~25% of their block reward straight away, as long as the borrowing interest is lower than their earnings, services like Aave could be the strategy for which small to medium miners would bootstrap mining operations.
Large investors: there are several Filecoin investors that may want to lend to miners to earn additional FIL interest and right now this can only be done via centralized services.

This may also be a building block to more complex tools for which investors can invest in mining pools (exposing themselves to FIL or other currencies of choice)
Note that renFIL is not the only FIL related asset, there is also WFIL (being made) and HFIL (already done - except US customers may be restricted to use it)",62,67.4,2020-11-02
['Proposal: add support for renFIL (Filecoin)'],"This is a great idea, as it would allow users to borrow FIL to run a node without having to sell their other assets. Basically try their hand at a little business without having to sell the house.
For any renX tokens, not sure if the proposal is to list them as renX tokens, or just have the renVM run in the background and the users simply see their actual tokens in AAVE (e.g. BTC, FIL, ZEC, etc)",43,18.6,2020-12-04

['Proposal: add support for renFIL (Filecoin)'],"Risk Analysis
In addition to the details above shared on the FileCoin protocol, it’s important to note 8 audits have been conducted to cover the different aspects.
The network is governed by the Filecoin Foundation funded by 5% of the supply with a 6 year vesting. Protocol Labs leads the development funded by 15% of the supply also vested. 70% of the 2 million FIL supply form the block rewards incentives as highlighted in the cryptoeconomics documentation.
Filecoin market has grown fast quickly reaching a wide audience and great market metrics with good liquidity.
The overall risk level of FIL is B which would make it fit for listing however it needs an ERC wrapper.
RenFIL
RenFIL is a tokenized representation of Filecoin on the Ethereum blockchain offered by RenVM decentralised custody. It is an ERC-20 backed 1:1 with native FIL locked in RenVM. Darknodes power the network, with the need to stake REN that can be slashed when the Darknode is responsible for loss of assets. For security reasons RenVM  can adjust the fees to try and keep the ratio of bonded value to locked assets value 3 to 1 implying circulating supply of renAssets is affected by participation in RenVM and the REN bonded value.
The analysis below focuses on the risks of RenFIL  mitigated by the market risks of FIL.
Screenshot 2021-02-08 at 15.45.11804×212 18 KB
RenFIL Smart contract Risk: C
RenVM is a byzantine fault-tolerant network that is able to securely in a decentralized manner do ECDSA threshold key generation and signing via sMPC, which allows RenVM to securely manage private keys of different assets like Bitcoin and Filecoin, and wrap these assets on smart-contract chains. Since launch, RenVM has processed around $1.5B in total volume of Bitcoin, Filecoin, Zcash, Bitcoin cash going to and from Ethereum. The smart contract risks of RenFIL are mitigated by those of RenBTC which has been battle tested by the markets.
Technically, renFIL is a proxied token standard ERC with some features on top:

Mechanism of exchange rate (similar to Aave slashing)
Permit for approvals
Recovery of other tokens sent to the contract

RenFIL Counterparty Risk: C
There is a proxy admin which can update all the logic of the contract with a 7 days timelock controller by a multisig, controlled by the team. Even with 7 days, it may be impossible to mitigate the consequences of a contract upgrade with minting for example.
Furthermore there is an EOA (Externally Owned Account) with permissions to mint, burn, change the exchange rate and decide which tokens sent by mistake to the renFIL contract are recoverable.
This results in the capability to burn tokens of a particular address (potentially the ones contained in  aToken) and the change of the implementation under the proxy.
RenFIL Market Risk: B (based on FIL)
RenFIL market capitalisation is unknown with very little liquidity in the markets. The redemption process is permissionless enabling smooth liquidations into the liquidity of FIL.
Risk Parameters
Given the centralisation of RenFIL it can only be listed as borrow asset
Reserve Factor 35%
Variable Interest Rate Model
UOptimal 80% (since not a collateral)
R_0 0%
R_s1 7%

['Proposal: secure 100% of investment in deposits for all markets'],"The defi world is currently reserved for geeks, developers, and whales. One of the reasons that can make mass adoption difficult is trust. Without a doubt, we can achieve great confidence if we ensure 100% of the capital invested in deposits.
One suggestion could be, for example, to do something similar to what traditional banking offers. Insure 100% up to a specific amount for example 200k USD, and from here on a variable percentage that depends on the funds blocked in the protocol.
There could be different types of stakers, with different percentages depending on the capital they are insuring.
We could also show before each operation what dynamic percentage from this 200k USD is being secured.
It could undoubtedly be a revolution for AAVE as a differentiator and we could surely receive a great investment from traditional finance.",29,60.8,2021-04-06
['Proposal: secure 100% of investment in deposits for all markets'],"You bring up a good point. If I understand you correctly, your suggestion is for AAVE to offer something protection on deposits up to a certain limit akin to the FDIC guarantee at U.S. banks. Some questions:


Would the protocol insure user capital deposits by minting AAVE and lock them up in some sort of escrow/treasury? If so, there is some sort of precedent if we look to Bancor’s single-sided liquidity pools.


How would such insurance affect AAVE tokenomics, and could it be managed to avoid run away inflation? I suppose AAVE could burn any tokens minted to insure deposits so they remain in the protocol.


Could AAVE charge depositors an insurance premium for such protection?


Could the protocol hedge its insurance risk and generate an ROI that goes back to the protocol or enhances interest rates paid to depositors?


Perhaps a pilot with USDC or DAI would be worth a shot.",17,13.4,2021-04-13
['Proposal: secure 100% of investment in deposits for all markets'],"1-2. I don’t know which would be the best option. Perhaps I was thinking more about for example an opposing party, for example if you deposit 1000 USD on another party there would be someone who would insure that 1000 USD and who would receive a%.
3.This could also be an option. Before the deposit you could choose the option that you like the most.

It seems clear that the% would decrease but a new product would be opened, for a client further removed from the crypto world or with a more conservative profile.

['[Discussion] Establish ETH Lending Rate Price Floor Through ETH2 Staking'],"Purpose: to initiate a discussion within the AAVE community on the feasibility of, and interest in the following idea:
Summary:
AAVE governance to establish ETH2 lending rate price floor through ETH2 staking in a trustless manner. If done correctly, it could significantly increase the security of the ETH network, AAVE protocol TVL and fees, and the utility of the AAVE token.
AAVE has a significant advantage in this space over a project like Lido Finance as it doesn’t need to issue a token like STETH that needs to integrate one by one into other DEFI protocols. Potential ETH  lenders simply see the increased rate offered by the protocol due to the price floor established.
However there are some inconvenient problems to consider regarding the liquidity of the ETH capital for use in arbitrage:

There is a 900 validator per day queue into and out of the ETH2 validator contract. (This goes up by 225 every 65,536 validators, once we hit 5 * 65536 validators. At that threshold it’s 1,125 / day; and then another 225 / day for every 64k more.)
There is a 9 day exit delay. Validator lifecycle | Prysm (prylabs.network). About a 10 day turnaround time in addition to the validator onboarding / exit queue.

Would be interested to hear some solutions to the above problem. I don’t think it’s unreasonable to assume the queue would be near zero (as it is now) with occasional spikes. This potentially could be solved by an “opt in” for longer term lenders similar to unstaking AAVE from the safety module.
Another point - AAVE’s community and governance would have to mobilize towards an active trustless DAO-like management of the validator ecosystem. This could potentially increase contribution and value of community to the protocol in a meaningful way. For example, the market is pricing the LIDO DAO at 1.4 billion (fully diluted).
Combining high ETH lending rates with a low stable coin borrow rates, AAVE can significantly increase market share.
Just an idea - would love to hear thoughts! :)",16,53.2,2021-04-11
['AAVE Safety Incentives'],"I’m currently learning about AAVE and how the staking works and if I understand correctly, the current rewards are taken from the AAVE Reserve, in which there are roughly 3m AAVE tokens and are being distributed to stakers at a rate of 550/day. Eventually though, given that the AAVE supply is limited to 16m, the rewards available to stakers will surely be depleted until there are none left, so my question is: what will the incentives be for people to stake their tokens once there are no more AAVE left to be distributed from the reserve?",35,72.0,2021-03-04

['Community Sentiment Poll : Asset Rescue Mission'],"Several members of the community have sent LEND to the LEND contract address and AAVE to the AAVE contract address, resulting in permanent loss of funds.
Assets concerned :


LEND : 840048 tokens currently worth around 300k$ Link to etherscan


AAVE : 28054 tokens currently worth around 1M$ Link to Etherscan


Each of these transfers are a personal tragedy, and community discussions current consensus aims towards a “rescue” mission to allow these users to claim back their assets.
Feel free to consult the Main discussion thread on the topic.
On the technical and operating side, a viable solution would be to add a retrieveStuckTokens() in the AAVE token contract, this method will be general-purpose and allow the users to retrieve any standard ERC-20 sent to the AAVE token contract address allowing to support the people that have made mistakes in the past and also support future issues.
The LEND token contract is immutable and can’t be modified in any way, a fitting solution would be to allocate a corresponding amount of AAVE from the lendToAaveMigrator contract to the users. This action will NOT result in AAVE token increased total supply as the corresponding amount of LEND will never be migrated to AAVE.
Implementing this would require a dedication of time and ressources from the Aave genesis team and a favorable AIP outcome to implement the changes to the token contracts.

['Base stable rate oracle update and improvements in Aave V2'],"The Aave V2 protocol implements a more aggressive IR for stable and variable rates compared to V1. Specifically, the risk parameters have been set as follows:
USDC — USDT
immagine1486×918 45.4 KB
DAI — TUSD
immagine1486×918 45.4 KB
Borrowers are taking this opportunity to borrow at a lower risk leading to a high share of stable borrows in V2. This is problematic as the stable rate only rebalances under stressed conditions, losing some of the risk management benefits of the variable rate.
The share of stable rates in V2 has significantly increased for all stablecoins:

DAI from 18.57% to 65.3%
USDC from 29.13% to 69.65%
USDT 45.73% to 77.2%

The reason for that is that compared to the market conditions when V2 launched, many new stablecoin farms appeared, which dramatically increased the demand for stablecoins. The current implementation of the Lending rate oracle cannot keep up with the ever changing market conditions.
This shows to be unhealthy in the long term: too aggressive stable rates fail to attract new liquidity, which dampens the protocol growth and imposes more UX overhead (more difficulty to withdraw liquidity as there is high utilization).
The genesis team proposes two solutions:


the short term fix is to manually override the lending rate oracle (which is still under the control of the Aave genesis team) and impose a base stable rate of 7% (against the current 4%). A base that is almost twice as high will at the same time disincentivize stable borrowing for the short medium/term, or provide higher APY for LPs if the borrowers still choose to borrow at stable.


The long term fix is to get rid of the Lending rate oracle completely by algorithmically set the spread between the stable rate and variable rate. This can be achieved by calculating the ratio



Where Ds is the total debt stable and Dv is the total debt variable. When R > 1, it means more of the reserve is being borrowed at stable, which increases the spread between stable and variable for new loans. When R < 1, the spread can be lower, to incentivize stable rate borrowing. The equation for the spread can be adjusted to target whatever value of R.
This removes the need for the lending rate oracle altogether, which also reduces the centralization risk and decreases gas costs.",49,664.8,2020-12-29

In the meantime, the demand for stablecoins increased further, requiring an adjustment of the Lending rate oracle. As a consequence of that, the rate oracle will increase of 2 points (from 7%  to 9%) for USDC and 3 points (from 7% to 10%) for DAI, TUSD and USDT

If you remove stable borrow, you give competitors a massive point of differentiation which, quite frankly, I would leave the protocol to obtain.
As it stands currently, borrow rates are beginning to make the protocol differentiated against competition - for a second time - in a negative way. While there may be technical reasons why “something would achieve X,” I am concerned there is not a long term consumer lens involved in the considerations.
Both of these add easily targeted points of differentiation for any competitor to exploit. At the existing stable borrow rates, I have begun to utilize competitive products.
I urge you to stop this path so I dont have to choose somewhere else. This protocol doesnt exist in a vacuum. It is easily better than competitors in many ways. Don’t make the main product offering uncompetitive.",16,23.2,2021-04-05

['ARC - Strategy for Aave treasury :'],"Hi Aave fam !
This ARC follows the discussion of the one about “Put the treasury to work” : ARC : Put the treasury to work
The Aave treasury has now passed 1.5M$, and it’s time to start earning interests on it, and for that, a good option between yield and security is curve, beside bringing some synergies between Aave and Curve.
Here is a breakdown of the situation of the treasury (made on March 30th so numbers won’t be fully accurate) :

image531×515 13.3 KB

As explained in the previous ARC, the Aave governance needs CRV to:


Boost the rewards on the pools that we will use for the strategy


To vote on gauge weights which can increase the weight of the Aave/sAave pools and other pools that could be created


To vote on proposals


To collect Curve trading fees


In order to maximize the boost, we need as many veCRV as possible, and we can obtain 1 veCRV by locking 1 CRV for 4 years in the Curve DAO.
Once every tokens will be transferred on the reserve factor address, my proposition would be to use all the small balances to buy CRV and lock it to obtain veCRV. Using altcoins to buy CRV would only be done once to start the strategy, we could hold the ones we receive after that.

As I write this, 1 CRV is worth 3.30$, so using those assets allow the treasury to buy 67763 CRV.

The fact that we don’t have a lot of CRV means that we have to split into several pools to increase the max $/veCRV, which must be as high as possible to reach max boost.
I tried with a few pools and ended up with the following ones :

With 67763 CRV, and using the pools listed above, we’re able to boost the treasury.
Most of the treasury is on Aave and sAave pool, Eth/sETH and Wbtc/Ren btc, but to reach the maximum boost on the entire treasury, we need to deposit a little on other pools too.
With the current numbers, the treasury would increase by 56% in a year (earning around 688k only with the Curve pools earnings), but locking CRV for 4 years also earn trading fees collected in 3Pool tokens, that we could distribute to stakers every month or 6 month, the main variable here being the gas.
3Pool tokens earned is currently around 9% of the value of CRV lock and with the current amount of CRV, this would bring around 15k$.
However, this is not over: Having veCRV makes the address eligible to earn an EPS airdrop on BSC from Ellipsis (Curve fork) every week during the next 50 weeks.
Currently, 69k veCRV would bring around 2800 EPS/Week (every airdrop is vested for 3 months but can be claimed with a 50% penalty tax) and with a token at 7$, that would still make around 490k$ a year.
Moreover, EPS can be staked (and locked) to receive more EPS and trading fees in BUSD.
Of course all of these numbers will and have probably already changed, it’s also to help understand the strategy, but here is a small review of what can be done in a year:

I did not took into account the tokens received by the reserve factor for the AMM market, EPS staking, and Ellipsis trading fees (that we could also distribute) and there is no compounding with these numbers, but we could compound the rewards, and we should probably do it, mainly with the CRV to increase the max capacity to boost.
For now, the protocol is generating around 20k$/day and by the end of the year, the income from CRV farming could be much higher.
I also started a discussion on Curve’s forum to approve Aave DAO on the Smart Wallet Whitelist that would allow Aave to deposit on Curve pools.



Should we use that strategy ?

GUSD is currently a supported asset on Aave, and we would like to have it be a collateral option as well.
Over the past months, growing support for GUSD by decentralized finance projects and platforms has led to a surge in its market cap to more than $120 million. We are looking to continue to grow the DeFi ecosystem on Gemini (by supporting governance token listings and working through future use cases e.g. bridge to defi, L2 support etc.) and through GUSD, which we believe to be one of the most secure and trusted USD-backed stablecoins.
Available Liquidity
There is currently over $100mm in GUSD liquidity in DeFi projects, and we’re actively engaging with industry partners on how to grow this liquidity in the ecosystem, and on Aave specifically. There is support for GUSD on a myriad of DeFi applications and projects, some of the larger ones include liquidity pools on Curve, Uniswap and Balancer, as well as collateral on Maker, and yield strategies on Yearn.
GUSD can also be created and redeemed for 1:1 USD on Gemini at scale. There are also no fees when creating and withdrawing GUSD on Gemini - we cover all gas costs.
Risk Parameters
Given GUSD is still growing in DeFi and on Aave, we think the below risk parameters could be considered:

LTV 70%
LT 75%
LB 5% (liquidation incentive)
RF 20%

If a loan has to be liquidated to repay gusd, that needs to happen within a single transaction. I’m not part of the liquidation squad so they may be able to speak more eloquently to it, but right now, most of GUSD liquidity is on Curve, not elsewhere. Which is fine if you want to use Machta or something, but one of the important features for borrowers within AAVE V2 is the ability to repay a loan with existing collateral in one transaction via a flash loan.
Currently those flashloans are restricted to Uniswap, which… realistically if you’re trying to repay a loan with collateral, on some level you know you pushed the risk too high and have to deal with slippage. However, a -2% depth of 14k on Uniswap just isn’t good enough even with that understanding (assumes coingecko is accurate).
That said, that’s my only real concern. No issues with the coin itself, just the on chain liquidity available outside of Curve.

['Discussion AAVE Layer 2 Solutions'],"Layer 2 Solutions
Regarding gas fees I’m not sure there will ever be a simple solution that the AAVE protocol itself can offer in a reasonable way on the mainnet. There are tons of layer 2 solutions in place that aave could utilize as additional means of accessing the network. Having used Matic/Polygon which has some great ways to use aTokens in general it only makes sense to me that people should be able to deposit funds directly through the Polygon network. Although I don’t possess the skills needed to do this it seems only logical for users to have an option to move their assets from Polygon to the AAVE protocol without needing to pay fees. Would love to hear input from the community on possible L2 solutions.
Edit: Some additional ideas I can’t get out of my head and will be posting below. Full disclosure currently I am solely using Polygon for management of my funds. Just wanted to let people know in order to clear up any possible biases. In addition I am by no means wealthy which could be why I have a major issue with the gas fees.
Governance & Staking
Some time early this year when I first did my research on AAVE I decided to stake my AAVE in order to participate in governance and the rewards incentive. Was simple and easy I knew the risks involved and was okay with it. Looking at it now at the end of February it seems significantly less appealing. In order to stake I will have to pay a significant fee AND put my funds at risk of being slashed. I have no issues with the risk of slashing or the current APY being provided, but I don’t think there is any reason we should be putting up with these gas fees. Through activating the unstake cooldown, claiming rewards, and voting these gas fees make the entire process incredibly inefficient. If we move the staking process and governance process over to a layer 2 solution like polygon/matic stakers could pay the one time gas fee to move their stkAAVE through the POS bridge and be able to handle all of the previously mentioned actions for 1/1000th of the cost of the current system. This alone should be incentive enough to seriously consider layer 2 solutions.
Trading
Currently on the Polygon/matic network I am offered opportunities that I would never be able to take advantage of on the Ethereum Mainnet. Through the matic bridge some geniuses ported over the AAVE interest bearing tokens which I believe is one of the most incredible features AAVE offers. Unfortunately I don’t think my writing skills will be enough to truly explain how great this feature is. Instead of trading eth to standard dai for example, I am able to trade directly to aDai for a few cents instead of spending $30+ on a deposit to the layer 1 aave solution. From my experience this changes the game when it comes to how I use stablecoins. Why would anyone want dai when they can use interest bearing dai to make trades? Stablecoins play a massive role in the AAVE ecosystem. From my understanding our borrowing market is primarily made up of stable coin borrows. By increasing access to aDai or aUSDC on other networks we can provide more competitive borrowing rates to everyone.
Lend
These layer 2 solutions are currently developing ecosystems. On just about every one of these you will find a fork of an existing eth protocol that can provide service for much cheaper. Although I have am incredibly skeptical of the longevity of these projects and there is a clear lack of innovation in these solutions they are competition for AAVE whether you want to acknowledge it or not. With the ability to get aTokens on layer 2 networks it indirectly provides a method of depositing onto the AAVE network yet there is no ability to interact with the borrowing portion of the protocol. To me this is nothing but an untapped market that AAVE can easily gain access to by supporting additional networks interfacing directly with the protocol. If AAVE were to add borrowing to networks like xDai, Polygon/matic, Bsc, or any layer 2 solution it would allow for users to directly interface with aave rather than relying on other parties to provide them a way to gain exposure to additional assets.
TLDR;
Aave doesn’t need to move to layer 2. It should however acknowledge the potential growth and benefits these developing ecosystems provide. There is no real downside to opening access to AAVE services on these platforms aside from the initial cost of development and deployment. The ease of access it provides gives first time users a much easier experience. The cost of exploring DeFi on the Ethereum mainnet is incredibly expensive not to mention incredibly punishing if a user is trying to use the services.",75,1260.0,2021-02-26

['ARC: Listing proposal of mStable assets: mUSD and imUSD'],"Listing proposal of mStable assets on Aave: mUSD and imUSD
To the Aave community, the mStable genesis team would like to submit a new ARC asset  onboarding proposal for two mStable assets: mUSD and imUSD.
mStable is building autonomous and non-custodial stablecoin infrastructure, and leverages lending income with trading fees to produce higher yielding, more capital efficient assets. It was created to tackle three major issues facing stablecoins today:

The fragmentation of same-peg assets
The lack of native yield
The lack of protection against permanent capital loss

About mUSD and imUSD
mUSD is a diversified meta-stablecoin that tracks the US dollar. It is available and liquid on Curve and Balancer and is increasingly being integrated across the broader DeFi ecosystem: 1inch, ARCx, Rari Capital, OpenDAO’s Open Market and many more.
imUSD is a tokenised and composable representation of mUSD deposits in mStable’s Save v2 contracts, a best-in-class savings account for DeFi. We envision imUSD would only offered as a collateral option on AAVE, and not be used for borrowing.
mUSD is currently only supported on CREAM’s Iron Bank.
imUSD is not yet supported on any major lending markets.
Benefits of adding mStable assets on Aave:

Diversification of stablecoin assets: mUSD is a meta-stablecoin with risk minimisation characteristics and censorship resistance. Adding mUSD would decrease aggregate risk in the Aave ecosystem
Once mUSD support is live, ~7M mUSD could be deployed from mStable’s Save v2 contract to seed the market for borrowing, increasing Aave’s TVL.
imUSD would be the first collateral yield bearing asset (pure USD yield) to become available for use on Aave.
Pave the way for future mStable assets on Aave: We have just released mBTC, and intend to release other stablecoins such as mEUR and mETH in future. mUSD and imUSD integration would set the stage for further collaboration between mStable and Aave’s ecosystems in future should that be desirable for the Aavengers.

Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token
mStable is a protocol that unites stablecoins, lending and swapping into one robust and easy to use standard. It is governed and secured by a protocol token, Meta, and is used to create “mStable assets”, which are tokenized representations of some value peg, such as USD in this case. The mUSD stablecoin can be used by a holder to earn interest from locking it in the “SAVE” section of our app, which resembles traditional savings accounts.
Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?
mUSD brings a risk minimised meta stablecoin not only with a large number of native yield farming opportunities but also with the ability to convert it into the underlying. This produces demand and also gives borrowers the opportunity to reduce the pressure on other leading stablecoins by borrowing and then converting to the underlying. (In addition to all the points we mentioned on forum etc)
Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?
mStable was begun in Melbourne, Australia, in late 2018. It was initially designed to address the fragmentation of stablecoin markets and the challenges to adoption and use that arose from this.
On July 18th, 2020, 2.66 million MTA were sold in an open public auction. The proceeds of this auction were collectively pooled in the mStable DAO.
In terms of challenges faced, one I think worth highlighting is raising capital for a “defi” project before DeFi was a prominent investment thematic. We overcame this by operating very lean, and focusing on the code above all else.
Another challenge would be balancing the shipping product at a fast pace, whilst managing security. We do this through multiple strategies such as consistent audits, guarded launches, and a bug bounty program on immune.fi.
How is the asset currently used?
mUSD is currently used as a stablecoin and lending asset. When saving mUSD in the SAVE section of the app, the asset converted into imUSD, a high-yield bearing token. This whole process is completed autonomously by mStable’s smart contracts and the user interacting with those smart contract.
mUSD is in the few cryptodollars offering reduced risk and volatility in the DeFi space.
Emission schedule: None. It is minted from underlying.
Token permissions and upgradability: Upgradability is performed through a 5/8 gnosis safe multisig, with some core team, and some external industry experts. In addition, there is a 1 week delay between when the upgrade is proposed and when it can be executed - giving users the chance to opt out from an upgrade. In addition, changes are only made after they have been proposed and voted on through snapshot. Learn more about mStable’s governance over our medium posts titled: Governance Update.

['ARC: Listing proposal of mStable assets: mUSD and imUSD'],"It is worth noting 2 other positive circular effects resulting from a potential listing of mUSD:


mStable is set to create and incentivise feeder pools for mUSD, which are 50/50 pools composed of [fAsset, mAsset], e.g. [bUSD, mUSD]. These pools are expected to be deeply liquid, and the assets in which can and will be lent out wherever possible to increase pool APY. Which an active market for mUSD, there is potentially 10’s of millions of liquidity waiting to be deposited here in the short term.


mStable has been an avid liquidity provider to Aave since Aave was at $5m TVL. Over the course of the past 6 months, assets in the mUSD basket have been lent on Aave markets. Adding mUSD as a market on Aave will only have a positive effect for mUSD overall TVL, and thus will provide not only more mUSD deposited through the SAVE contract (as mentioned by Fauve above), but also from the underlying mUSD collateral (USDT, sUSD and TUSD).

This is a Civilized Place for Public Discussion
Please treat this discussion forum with the same respect you would a public park. We, too, are a shared community resource — a place to share skills, knowledge and interests through ongoing conversation.
These are not hard and fast rules, merely guidelines to aid the human judgment of our community and keep this a clean and well-lighted place for civilized public discourse.

Improve the Discussion
Help us make this a great place for discussion by always working to improve the discussion in some way, however small. If you are not sure your post adds to the conversation, think over what you want to say and try again later.
The topics discussed here matter to us, and we want you to act as if they matter to you, too. Be respectful of the topics and the people discussing them, even if you disagree with some of what is being said.
One way to improve the discussion is by discovering ones that are already happening. Spend time browsing the topics here before replying or starting your own, and you’ll have a better chance of meeting others who share your interests.

Be Agreeable, Even When You Disagree
You may wish to respond to something by disagreeing with it. That’s fine. But remember to criticize ideas, not people. Please avoid:

Name-calling
Ad hominem attacks
Responding to a post’s tone instead of its actual content
Knee-jerk contradiction

Instead, provide reasoned counter-arguments that improve the conversation.

Your Participation Counts
The conversations we have here set the tone for every new arrival. Help us influence the future of this community by choosing to engage in discussions that make this forum an interesting place to be — and avoiding those that do not.
Discourse provides tools that enable the community to collectively identify the best (and worst) contributions: bookmarks, likes, flags, replies, edits, and so forth. Use these tools to improve your own experience, and everyone else’s, too.
Let’s leave our community better than we found it.

If You See a Problem, Flag It
Moderators have special authority; they are responsible for this forum. But so are you. With your help, moderators can be community facilitators, not just janitors or police.
When you see bad behavior, don’t reply. It encourages the bad behavior by acknowledging it, consumes your energy, and wastes everyone’s time. Just flag it. If enough flags accrue, action will be taken, either automatically or by moderator intervention.
In order to maintain our community, moderators reserve the right to remove any content and any user account for any reason at any time. Moderators do not preview new posts; the moderators and site operators take no responsibility for any content posted by the community.

Always Be Civil
Nothing sabotages a healthy conversation like rudeness:

Be civil. Don’t post anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive, abusive, or hate speech.
Keep it clean. Don’t post anything obscene or sexually explicit.
Respect each other. Don’t harass or grief anyone, impersonate people, or expose their private information.
Respect our forum. Don’t post spam or otherwise vandalize the forum.

These are not concrete terms with precise definitions — avoid even the appearance of any of these things. If you’re unsure, ask yourself how you would feel if your post was featured on the front page of the New York Times.
This is a public forum, and search engines index these discussions. Keep the language, links, and images safe for family and friends.

Keep It Tidy
Make the effort to put things in the right place, so that we can spend more time discussing and less cleaning up. So:

Don’t start a topic in the wrong category.
Don’t cross-post the same thing in multiple topics.
Don’t post no-content replies.
Don’t divert a topic by changing it midstream.

Motivation
sUSD market cap has grown tremendously over the past year and the steady demand for decentralized  stable coins has contributed to its growth. sUSD is highly over collateralized by SNX, the governance token and backstop for the Synthetix protocol.
The rise in its liquidity on major dexes has contributed to sUSD stability over the past year and allowing collateral use would promote its liquidity in aave markets.
With over with over 25% of the sUSD supply liquid on chain, in AMMs, sUSD is a viable candidate for collateral on AAVE.
Rationale
SNX stakers are incentivized to actively manage their dept relative to their SNX stake and in doing so sometimes cause spikes in demand for sUSD on markets including AAVE (specially when their are other Yield generating opportunities with sUSD), this may cause small deviations from the peg but with low volatility.
All underlying functions in relation to sUSD, are fundamentally the same, from a counter-party risk perspective, to that of SNX.
The SNX and sUSD contracts are fully upgradeable, but all changes must go through a formal governance process from SIP to deployment, which would be announced well before the upgrades are made and thus does not present a substantial counter-party risk.
The sUSDv2CRV pool is one of the main CurveDAO emissions gauges, incentivizing sustainable longterm liquidity for sUSD.
In addition to sUSD there are other synth pools on Curve with emission gauges to supplement sUSD liquidity (sBTC, sETH ). All synths are redeemable at their dollar value in sUSD at the ChainLink quoted price, through the Synthetix protocol or Curve (via cross-asset swaps), thus they help facilitate the arbitrage of sUSD peg deviations.

['Proposal: Add support for Terra USD (UST)'],"Summary:
This is a proposal for adding borrow/lend support for TerraUSD (UST) on AAVE
Background:
TerraUSD (UST) is an algorithmic, seigniorage-based stablecoin issued by Terraform Labs (TFL). UST is one of the fastest growing algorithmically stablecoins to-date. Its market capitalization has grown to almost $200 million (​https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/terra-usd​) since its inception on October 1.
TFL currently uses Shuttle (​https://github.com/terra-project/shuttle#terra–ethereum​) to bring Terra assets, including UST, to Ethereum. At the time of this writing, the supply of erc-20 UST is roughly $50 million.
Liquidity:
Current stablecoins supported by Aave (by market size):

USDT ($23B)
USDC ($4.5B)
DAI ($1.3B)
BUSD ($1.1B)
HUSD ($280M)
UST (190M)
SUSD ($160M)
GUSD ($33M) - just passed

UST currently has a daily trading volume of ~$20 million, and is  supported on Curve.fi, SushiSwap, Uniswap: https://eth.mirror.finance/, and is a centerpiece of Mirror Protocol (https://mirror.finance/).
Benefits for Aave:

Diversification of stablecoin assets: the majority of stablecoins on Aave are centralized. Adding UST would add diversity to the different asset types and decrease aggregate risk of the Aave ecosystem
Diversity of users from both the Terra community (and broader Asia)
Mirror Protocol (​https://mirror.finance/​) has recently been launched, driving demand for UST. We believe UST support will provide significant liquidity to the Aave ecosystem

I agree. The Synthetix has grown since the LTV calibration with an overall decrease in collateralisation requirements on the native ecosystem

['Proposal: Add support for Golem Network Token (GLM)'],"Hello AAVE frens,
I’m very excited to be here on behalf of the Golem team, since we just migrated our 4 year old token to the ERC-20 standard and finally can participate in DeFi! This is our very first application as well 
We think being able to trade GLM on AAVE and use it as collateral would further widen our commitment to decentralization and the Ethereum ecosystem. One of the main reasons we chose to migrate the token to ERC-20 is to leverage DeFi and allow our token holders to discover this ecosystem which, believe it or not, it’s not very well known to them (some history - Golem crowdfunded in 2016, and back then, the ERC-20 standard was not popular, and DeFi did not exist, so our legacy community is still discovering the topic!)
About Golem Network
Golem Network is a marketplace for idle computing power. It enables providers and requestors of computing power to connect in a trustless peer-to-peer network enabling both application owners and individual users (“requestors”) to rent resources from other users’ (“providers”) machines.
These resources can be used to complete tasks requiring any amount of computation time and capacity. Nowadays, centralized cloud providers are in control of these services, these platforms are constrained by closed networks, proprietary payment systems, and hard-coded provisioning operations. Golem proposes an open-source, decentralized and user controlled alternative.
About GLM
GLM, is an ERC-20 (Ethereum-based) token,  is s a utility token used to access the Golem Network and the currency to pay other users within the Network for renting computations.
GLM marks an important milestone in leveraging Layer 2 solutions for microtransactions.
We held a crowdfunding in on November 11, 2016 and ended in 29 minutes. In total we created 1.000.000.000 GNT and fundraised 820.000 ETH / (8M USD at the time).
We subsequently migrated GNT to GLM on a ration 1:1.
Why AAVE
We believe that being able to trade GLM on AAVE and use it as collateral, will be pivotal to our future endeavours as it will allow creators and requestors to exchange GLM in in a transparent way, hence will facilitate the development of an ecosystem of Web3.0 applications running on Golem.",48,2989.6,2021-01-29

Following the risk methodology it looks like Golem positions itself pretty well considering the risk scores:

smart contract risk: B+ considering a maturity of >1.5k days and >1M transfers;
counterparty risk: B+ considering its decentralized nature and with >100k holders;
market risk: C+ considering the lower average volume of 20M in the last 30 days even though it has a market cap of 469M and a normalized volatility of aprox. 0.029;

"['Yearn in Bad Faith: Bully Tactics, Arrogance, and Disregard for AAVE Users']","After their most recent proposal, which was co-authored by core ops team member @tracheopteryx, I propose that we issue a blanket denial of any preferential treatment for Yearn.
Their Proposal wanted: 3% fixed interest rate per year, increase of liquidation level to 85% for YFI. In the instance that they get hacked again (as they were last month), AAVE users would have taken losses as this collateralization level far exceeds even the most basic risk parameters.
Furthermore, they have a history of finding technicalities to go against on chain votes within their governance structure (the vote to burn the minting keys was on chain) which suggests that the core ops team that stated development of the proposal has no interest in mutual benefit. They seek amoral increases to their protocol… which frankly is their right to do so. But I do not think AAVE should engage in discussions with those who would behave in such a manner.
They will claim “we are open to debate and want a fully inclusive defi system.” Then why didnt they offer ANY benefit to AAVE at all in their proposal? Either the the core ops team didn’t know it was putting the AAVE protocol and users at risk or they didn’t care. Either way, this is not a team we should engage in discussions for preferential treatment of their usage of our services.
Their “benefit” to AAVE: those putting in USD assets would have higher utilization rates so retail borrowers would have to pay higher APY to offset the 3%.
This type of proposal is unacceptable and I do not believe we should engage in any discussions with amoral actors that seek to maximize their exposure whilst pushing the risk of said exposure onto this protocol.
I think in the interest of mutual benefits to the DeFi ecosystem, they should use the platform exactly as it was intended and not through negotiation of the type of backhanded deals so commonplace in in the traditional banking system DeFi seeks to disrupt.

Our first post here, a warm hello to the Aave community from Yearn!  

In short
Strengthen the symbiotic relationship between Aave and Yearn by taking the following actions: 


Disable YFI as a borrowing asset in order to prevent governance and shorting attacks, which in turn enables aYFI to be accepted in Yearn Governance, thereby increasing the utilization of Aave within Yearn products.

Extend a special 3% fixed interest facilit…

['Listing Proposal: Add RUNE ERC-20 (THORChain)'],"$RUNE on Aave1012×506 29.1 KB
Summary :
Proposal by THORChain community member Oaksprout
RUNE has recently been growing its economic bandwidth on Ethereum. Myself and other community members have expressed a desire to be able to use the ERC-20 asset as collateral for lending. Aave is the premier credit facility in crypto, and so here is a listing proposal for the community’s review.
Overview of THORChain and $RUNE
THORChain is a decentralised network focused on bringing liquidity to cross-chain assets. It does this using a simple Uniswap-like automated market maker (AMM) design. Some have called it “Uniswap for the multichain world”.
THORChain has been live with mainnet assets since September 2020 and its flagship multichain network is scheduled to go to testnet imminently.
The project is built on tried-and-tested technical and economic primitives, including Tendermint BFT, Cosmos SDK, Gennaro and Goldfeder’s Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) and a variant on Uniswap’s constant function market making formula.

Official Docs: https://docs.thorchain.org/

Community Education Site: https://rebase.foundation/network/thorchain


Audits:
Audits have been completed since April 2020 by:

CertiK – token model and application security
Gauntlet – economic security & mechanism design
Kudelski Security – cryptography review
IOActive – node infra

No major issues were reported. The team reports further audits are underway. See all reports.
Benefits for Aave:

First-Mover: RUNE has only recently been made available as an ERC-20 asset, and Aave would be the first venue to make RUNE borrowing available.
Community and New Users: The THORChain community is extremely strong, vocal and eager to support related projects. This listing would bring a strong influx of new users.
Economic Bandwidth: the total economic value available in THORChain is approaching $1bn, up from ~$85m just 90 days ago.

Benefits for THORChain Community:

Efficient Token Use: allow holders to loan RUNE to people more willing to put the tokens to work via LPing, running nodes or arbitrage.
Extend RUNE’s Value Proposition: increasingly, a token’s value is tied to its maturity as an asset. Being able to access credit on RUNE is a major stepping stone towards full maturity.

Risk Mitigation:
THORChain has been extensively audited by top firms, including CertiK, Gauntlet and Kudelski. The initial single-chain chaosnet implementation has matured well and the multichain testnet has been running with Bitcoin and Binance, with chains including Ethereum, Cosmos etc following soon. The team has staged a pragmatic and disciplined guarded rollout with only minor issues to date. Having examined the Aave Risk Framework I expect RUNE to find itself around a B-/C+ rating.
Thank you for your consideration.

['Listing Proposal: Add RUNE ERC-20 (THORChain)'],"Super interesting proposal and we’re obviously big fans of THORChain at Delphi.
That said, would be great to get some more data on the on-chain liquidity for the ERC-20 THORChain.
Would also be interested in getting your thoughts on how this liquidity profile will change once cross-chain is live given you’d expect the majority of RUNE volume to move to THORChain itself?",40,58.0,2021-02-02
['Listing Proposal: Add RUNE ERC-20 (THORChain)'],"UPDATE: the THORChain team has doubled the upper limits of the amount of RUNE which can be bridged to Ethereum, based on heavy demand. So the limit is now 20m. I haven’t changed the numbers below so please factor this in as you read.

Thanks for raising these points here too, José! This is an important point for the community to be aware of.
The THORChain team capped the maximum number of RUNE tokens to cross from Binance Chain to Ethereum at 10m. The current number of RUNE that have migrated is 8.8m (source CoinGecko). Assuming $4 RUNE and that the 10m cap is hit, we’ll soon have $40m dollars worth on Ethereum.
So we have a conservative assumption of $40m ERC-20 RUNE at launch. How much stays? Well, according to Delphi’s own tool it looks like 30% of RUNE is currently being put to work. I expect that to increase with multichain. With a margin of safety lets say 50% migrates, leaving 5m RUNE, or $20m dollars worth.
This number could be quibbled with, but the reality is it’s a chicken and egg situation. If there’s lending available on Aave then much more RUNE is likely to stay. That’s certainly how I feel, and the support for this proposal signals that the community feels similarly.


Notes
It wouldn’t be prudent for this community to speculate on the price of RUNE, but the fact is that the asset’s meteoric price increase comes off the back of the network’s imminent flagship network launch.
The THORChain team will make it possible to move from ERC-20 to native RUNE on the network’s own chain. They have said it is unlikely that there will be a reverse bridge. However, they support RUNE being used to forge relationships on Ethereum.

Beyond the topic of liquidity I hope this proposal can be seen as a bridge between communities and a small investment in the longer term relationship. What’s more I hope this proposal is workable because as the majority of RUNE will be on the native chain, other cross-chain credit protocols will have a natural technical advantage in attracting the burgeoning THORChain asset ecosystem, for the native asset and liquidity pool tokens and more.",42,108.4,2021-02-15

Paragraph Summary
RUNE has recently been growing its economic bandwidth on Ethereum. Myself and other community members have expressed a desire to be able to use the ERC-20 asset as collateral for lending. Aave is the premier credit facility in crypto, and so here is a listing proposal for the community’s review.
Motivation
Listing RUNE benefits the Aave community in the following ways:


Unique Properties: RUNE has properties which makes it desirable as both a collateral and borrow asset (discussed in detail later).


First-Mover: RUNE has only recently been made available as an ERC-20 asset, and Aave would be the first venue to make RUNE borrowing available.


Community and New Users: The THORChain community is extremely strong, vocal and eager to support related projects. This listing would bring a strong influx of new users.


Specifications
NB: At this moment, the majority of RUNE is based on Binance Chain as a BEP2 asset. This will soon migrate to a token native to the THORChain. There is also a significant portion of RUNE bridged to Ethereum as an ERC-20. For the sake of providing adequate context, I will provide data about the BEP2 asset as well as the asset in question, ERC-20 RUNE.
What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?
Oaksprout is a long-term community member of THORChain and holder of RUNE. He has also spent a lot of time in the Aave community and holds AAVE.
Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token
THORChain is a decentralised network focused on bringing liquidity to cross-chain assets. It does this using a simple Uniswap-like automated market maker (AMM) design. Some have called it “Uniswap for the multichain world”.
THORChain has been live with mainnet assets since September 2020 and its flagship multichain network is scheduled to go to testnet imminently.
The project is built on tried-and-tested technical and economic primitives, including Tendermint BFT, Cosmos SDK, Gennaro and Goldfeder’s Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) and a variant on Uniswap’s constant function market making formula.
Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?
RUNE is a unique asset in that it is both a desirable collateral and borrow asset. This is due to 2 main elements of its novel design:


strong value accrual design and deterministic price floor – desirable collateral asset


RUNE price is tied to the deepest liquidity assets in crypto, and therefore market neutral – desirable borrow asset


Desirable Collateral Asset
THORChain provides competitive long-term yield for large cap assets, and efficiently converts that liquidity into RUNE market cap through a unique economic design. All this amounts to an asset with extremely high upside potential. This is desirable as collateral as it makes it easier and more efficient to manage collateral positions.
Additionally, THORChain’s economic model requires that $3 of RUNE is staked for every $1 of pooled asset, e.g. BTC. This means that with time, a deterministic price floor will emerge, i.e. collateral providers will always have a solid price floor to plan around.
Desirable Borrow Asset
RUNE is a desirable borrow asset because of its wide and deep market exposure. Given that RUNE is the settlement asset of the network, its price volatility is tied to the liquidity levels and prices of connected assets. THORChain optimises for sucking in liquidity from the largest cap assets. Given this, RUNE is likely to become market neutral to the entirety of the crypto market. For this reason, RUNE stands a good chance of becoming a desirable borrow asset given its relative stability to the rest of crypto, and to the assets on Aave.
For these reasons I believe RUNE represents unique benefits to the Aave ecosystem.
Provide a brief history of the project and how it overcame stressed conditions
THORChain was founded in 2018 by an anonymous group of developers. Note that anonymity is important design choice in securing the network.
THORChain’s single chain chaosnet, using mainnet assets, was released in late August, 2020. There were minor issues with this release, but the team responded quickly and decisively. What’s more, this release was a part of a “guarded launch” which intentionally aims to progressively increase capital at stake to battle test in a real-world environment.
The team recently released multichain testnet, again using the same pragmatic “guarded launch” approach.
How is the asset currently used?
ERC-20 RUNE is predominantly used as a source of liquidity on Sushiswap. There, RUNE is pooled with ~a dozen major DeFi assets including AAVE.
Recently 10m RUNE was bridged over to Ethereum by the THORChain team to meet demand. That is mostly still sitting in the deployer contract, waiting to be used on Ethereum.
See the breakdown below. Note that several of the largest uses of RUNE are on Sushiswap, but a significant part remains ununused.
916×413
BEP2 RUNE is roughly 30% deployed, on Binance Chain. See the breakdown below:

Source: Delphi Digital THORChain Dashboard
Emission schedule
Current circulating supply of RUNE is 238,275,761. Total circulating supply will be 500 million.
Current circulating supply of RUNE in ERC-20 form is 10,075,916. Current maximum supply on Ethereum is 20 million. This number was recently doubled from 10 million.
Figures sourced from CoinGecko data on BEP2 RUNE and ERC-20 RUNE. See further details on THORChain’s ERC-20 version of RUNE.
THORChain rewards early behaviour by giving out RUNE to active participants. It gives out 1/6 of its reserve each year. THORChain aims to reach 2% annual inflation after 10 years.

Technical Specifications & Security Considerations

['Proposal: Improving Support for TrueCurrencies'],"Hello - I’m Rafael, CEO of TrustToken, and our team would like to propose improving the support for TrueCurrencies on AAVE.
Specifically, we’d like to propose the following changes:
1. Add support for TrueAUD, TrueCAD, TrueGBP, and TrueHKD
2. Change TrueUSD LTV from 1% to 75% (same as DAI and USDC)

Why AAVE benefits from increasing support for TrueCurrencies
Popularity:  TUSD has been listed on AAVE since 2019, currently ranks 3rd in market size among stablecoins on AAVE, and makes up 13.6% of AAVE’s total market size.
Largest AAVE markets at time of writing, sorted by Total Borrowed:

With increased LTV for TrueUSD, as well as the additional assets, we believe TrueCurrencies could grow AAVE’s total market size by an additional $150mm from where it is today.
New use cases: TrueCurrencies such as TCAD, TAUD, TGBP, and THKD, can add value to AAVE by allowing users to on-ramp via their native currencies or speculate on Forex with leverage.
Transparency: TUSD is the only stablecoin with live attestations to corroborate TUSD out in the market with dollars held in escrow. These attestations are facilitated by top accounting firm Armanino, LLP.
Reliability: Based on DeFi Score, TUSD on AAVE has the highest trust rating of any fiat-backed stablecoin currently listed on the platform.
Liquidity: TUSD is at over $280M in market cap at the time of writing, ranking as the 4th largest stablecoin after USDT, USDC, and DAI. It enjoys deep liquidity on both centralized and decentralized exchanges.
DeFi Adoption: The MakerDAO community accepted our TUSD collateral application and is in the process of green-lighting TAUD, TGBP, and TCAD.
Status:

TUSD Proposal Poll: (99.99% voted “Yes”)

TGBP Greenlight Poll: (100% voted “Yes”)

TAUD Greenlight Poll: (100% voted “Yes”)

TCAD Greenlight Poll: (100% voted “Yes”)


Access: TUSD is widely available through both 1st party and 3rd party fiat-to-crypto on-ramps, creating a new entry point for both individual and institutional AAVE users. You can mint and redeem it right here.
Weaknesses
TAUD, TCAD, TGBP, and THKD have lower liquidity when compared to TUSD. However, for each of our stablecoins AAVE is open to onboarding, TrustToken can commit to providing $350k of liquidity at the time of listing to seed the market.
Feedback
We think there is a strong partnership here and would love to work with the AAVE community to address any questions or concerns.",75,525.0,2020-08-19
['Proposal: Improving Support for TrueCurrencies'],"I agree that adding support for tokenised international currencies is a good move for the reasons you mentioned, with ability to interact with native currencies my favourite. In my own experience, TrustToken and their services are impressively professional. Adding support for these currencies like a good idea which would benefit users.

While the liquidity on the other TrueCurrencies is smaller than TUSD, it’s markets like AAVE that help to grow that liquidity. We’re also working on increasing TrueCurrency liquidity on Uniswap and will have more updates on that soon.



 Alex_BertoG:

While this is one possible path, I don’t think it’s the best one. TrueCurrencies are, by many measures, the most trustworthy stablecoins in the world.

TrueCurrencies are the only stablecoins with live attestations to corroborate TUSD out in the market with dollars held in escrow. These attestations are facilitated by top accounting firm Armanino, LLP.
We’re now working with oracles to become the only stablecoins to live report collateralization on-chain.
Based on DeFi Score, TUSD on AAVE has the highest trust rating of any fiat-backed stablecoin currently listed on the platform, higher than DAI, USDC, and USDT.
Unlike some other stablecoins, purchasing and redeeming TrueCurrencies is easy. Just go here.

If you told me you were considering listing a stablecoin with a lower DeFi trust rating, without live attestations, and, like some, more difficult to mint and redeem, I’d also be concerned!

['ARC: Deepen cooperation with Yearn'],"Authors: Ali Atiia, @lehnberg, Sam Bacha, @Wot_Is_Goin_On
Our first post here, a warm hello to the Aave community from Yearn! 

In short
Strengthen the symbiotic relationship between Aave and Yearn by taking the following actions:


Disable YFI as a borrowing asset in order to prevent governance and shorting attacks, which in turn enables aYFI to be accepted in Yearn Governance, thereby increasing the utilization of Aave within Yearn products.

Extend a special 3% fixed interest facility to Yearn’s Treasury, which commits to making a 1,000 YFI deposit maintained with up to 65% utilization (loan-to-value).

Enable access to Native Credit Delegation for Yearn vaults, allowing Aave Liquidity Providers (LPs) to delegate to Yearn vaults directly from within Aave’s interface. Aave in turn can earn a share of the revenues generated from the vault fees.

Rationale
Individually, each action creates value. Taken together, these actions reinforce each other and the positive impact on both Aave and Yearn:
Disabling YFI as a borrowing asset


Makes Aave more competitive, as it eliminates concerns of governance [1] and shorting attacks using borrowed YFI. This allows Aave to compete with Maker as the preferred place to deposit YFI as collateral:

Yearn Strategists can include Aave as part of YFI vault strategies without exposing it to the concerns above
Yearn Treasury can use Aave in the same way it recently used Maker to open up a 9.7m DAI position[2]

Large holders would be more willing to deposit into Aave



Increases demand for aYFI. Once governance attacks are no longer possible, aYFI could be supported in Yearn’s guest-list repo[3], making it eligible to vote in Yearn Governance. Aave’s aYFI is explicitly excluded today[4] due to the above concerns.
Comes at low opportunity cost to Aave. There is negligible demand to borrow YFI today. Only 3.57%[5] of deposited YFI is being borrowed.

Extending a special 3% fixed interest facility to Yearn’s Treasury
Yearn recently minted 4,444 YFI for their Treasury.[6] Of these, ~2,600 YFI have so far been deposited into Maker and used as debt collateral[7]. By offering favourable terms to Yearn’s Treasury, Aave can attract these deposits. The size of deposited funds and the accrued interest thereof warrants special treatment.
A fixed interest rate works in the favor of both projects: Yearn gets predictable debt servicing costs, while Aave earns predictable yield.
Enabling access to Native Credit Delegation for Yearn vaults
Yearn has been supporting Aave’s credit delegation functionality since it was launched[8] through yborrow.finance[9] and more recently in the yet-to-be-released yDelegate[10]. Native Credit Delegation[11], a feature part of Aave v2, allows LPs to delegate into Yearn vaults directly from within Aave’s own interface.
As an example, an ETH depositor wanting to maintain their ETH long exposure while at the same time earning interest in Yearn’s yDAI vault, could draw DAI and delegate it directly to the vault from Aave’s interface.
This would allow Aave to become one of the first participants in Yearn’s recently announced Partnership Program[12], earning a share of the revenue from Yearn vault fees that Aave users would generate.
Requirements
1. Disable YFI as a borrowing asset
YFI should no longer be lent out as a borrowing asset by Aave protocol to its users.
2. Extend a special 3% fixed interest facility to Yearn’s Treasury
Offer a special facility to Yearn’s Treasury under more attractive terms, in exchange for a minimum deposit being met.

3. Enable access to Native Credit Delegation for Yearn vaults
From a technical standpoint, the only thing required would be to interface with the deposit() and withdraw() calls of vaults. There’s an in-progress Yearn SDK[13] to make integrations such as these easier, and the Yearn development team is at Aave’s disposal to help with integrating.
Aave can then earn rev share on the TVLs contributed through Native Credit Delegation from its UI, by passing deposits and withdrawals through an Affiliate Wrapper[14] contract.
By using the wrapper, up to 50% share of the net revenues can be earned, based on total TVLs contributed across all vaults in a given time period.

Based on the min deposit and liquidation threshold params, this is implicitly assuming that liquidating 1000 YFI would cause less than 15% slippage - this seems like a risky assumption, made worse by the fact that Yearn’s treasury position getting liquidated would be bearish for long term fundamentals.

My understanding is, aYFI holders will be given YFI voting rights, but AAVE governance won’t have any additional direct influence in Yearn governance. So this could make Aave’s borrowing products more competitive for YFI holders but I’m not sure I consider it a direct benefit to Aave.

Since the genesis team understands perfectly the need of defending other protocols from governance attacks (there was a discussion here on the forum already created by @jordan) a borrow cap functionality is going to be introduced in Aave 2.5, currently in development. This will both derisk the aave from potential infinite minting and allow more fine tuned parameters to avoid governance attacks on other protocols.",65,148.0,2021-02-23
['ARC: Deepen cooperation with Yearn'],"Thank you for your comments/questions.
Q: I understand this as a defensive moat for Yearn.
A: This proposal seeks to benefit both Yearn and Aave.
Q: However, increased demand for Yearn would increase the borrowing demand for Aave wouldn’t it?
A: All loans on Aave increase the borrowing demand, which increases the utilization ratio and therefore leads to higher interest rates.
Q: Thus, Aave would be giving up its opportunity for a set/fixed interest. In some ways couldn’t this potential push away Locked value from earn because it removes the capacity to structure financial positions for users?
A: I think you’re asking whether the higher interest rates due to Yearn’s loan could discourage other borrowers on Aave. This would be true if nothing else changed. However, higher borrowing interest rates mean higher lending rates and this would incentivize more lenders on Aave which could further increase total value locked (TVL).
Aave risks giving up the opportunity if Yearn chooses to borrow from another lending protocol.
Q: Can you further explain how this benefits Aave users/borrowers/lenders?
A:
Lenders
Increasing the amount borrowed will increase the stablecoin utilization ratio and therefore the interest paid to lenders. Lenders will therefore benefit from the interest paid by Yearn on the loan.
There are circumstances (e.g. when utilization ratios are high) that lenders might earn higher rewards without Yearn’s fixed rate loan, however, lenders would generally prefer to have the certainty of a large borrower (which is what is being proposed) than missing out on higher rates in certain circumstances.
Borrowers
Stablecoin borrowers will pay a higher interest rate if Yearn takes out a loan on Aave because the utilization ratio will increase. The increase in interest rates would be caused by the higher utilization ratio, not because of the proposed fixed 3% per annum borrowing rate. Any sizeable loan on Aave would increase the borrowing rate. If borrowing rates increase on Aave, then lending rates increase, and this incentivises more lenders to supply stablecoins on Aave, thus potentially increasing Aave’s (TVL).",63,117.6,2021-02-23
['ARC: Deepen cooperation with Yearn'],"AAVE governance wouldn’t have any direct specific extra YFI voting rights unless the members of governance held YFI or aYFI or had delegated authority from a holder of  aYFI or YFI but also ARC would deliberately and specifically closer align AAVE’s success and benefit to that of existing YFI holders. I hold both and care about both.

I think there is a lot of additional risk to the proposal. The current liquidation ratio for YFI on Aave is 55%, which leaves a lot more room to accommodate volatility and price declines before Aave starts to lose money (versus proposed 85% ratio).
Stablecoin rates were averaging above 10% for the past month, so some combination of other borrowers, depositors, or the Aave platform would be subsidizing yearn to the tune of 5-10% APY on their borrowed amount.

There are extra fees and utilization of assets brought on by the offer.  I would have to break out the old spreadsheets to do a proper modeled analysis but it’s my current understanding that the demand for borrowing YFI isn’t high and the value of accepting the offer would outweigh the value of interest earned from not accepting it. The concerns about it looking like an unfair deal biased towards Yearn is actually understandable and the systemic risks should be discussed but 1,000 YFI  seems like a large enough number to me to be large enough that a more stable tier isn’t irrational. Maybe even a lower base rate with a variable rate based on the market or some other aspect to ensure that AAVE doesn’t just subsidize Yearn while everyone else faces higher and higher rates that would make it look like AAVE and Yearn whales/Devs don’t care about the greater ecosystem or the small users, that’s at least reasonable to me. I understand that I have a positive bias towards Yearn but I don’t actually see this as an unreasonable offer from anyone and would like to see more of why it’s not beneficial for AAVE.

['ARC - Fees & Rewards: How to improve the $AAVE token value?'],"Hello everyone!
This proposition is an overview of the main questions actually discussed on the governance forums and a potential solution.
Topics covered :

Generated fees from the protocol
Treasury
Use and distribution of Ecosystem Reserve
Aligned interests between Stakers, Liquidity Providers and the protocol
Migration dead line
Positive impacts on $AAVE token, and rewards overview

I) Generated fees from the protocol :
Regarding previous discussions and after some research, fees will be collected in several possibility with V2 coming soon. The main interest is the protocol to grow, and we need more liquidity for that.
This wouldn’t make sense to setup an origination fees on the liquidity deposited, and if we want to maintain traction to the Aave ecosystem, the origination fees on the borrowed liquidity could be very low as well, somewhere between 0.005% and 0.01%. Yes, it’s very low, but this is not where Aavengers will earn the most, and this avoids cutting users.
Liquidators, on the other side, are making money out of pretty much nothing, considering they are using Aave liquidity with flash loans, so they just need to pay the fees. The idea is not to cut the liquidators profits as they are essentials to a healthy protocol, but we could raise the fees from 0.09% to 0.1% of the borrowed amount.
Another way to earn fees could be a small % of the profits earned by liquidators, considering they are doing it using Aave. The fee could be between 0.5% less than 1% of profit.
As Aave offers a choice between stable and variable borrowing rate, we could add 0.1% fees when someone switch from one to another.
With V2, users will be able to change the collateral used, or to payback a loan with collateral, and fees on this could also be 0.1% or even more, as this is an innovation only available on Aave.
We may also add a fee when someone open a delegation credit line, and there Is probably more with all markets already there or potentially coming soon (UniV2, Token Set, Realt, Centrifuge, Aavegotchi, Jarvis and probably more)
The % of fees are only examples, and some people more experimented might tell us the proper rate for each interaction. Maybe @MarcZeller ?
How to use the fees?
As mentioned in previous discussions, this would be a good point to make a treasury for the protocol (maybe 1M $). Instead of using ecosystem reserve, we could use the generated fees to swap it into stablecoins until this the treasury reach amount defined.
Once we get full treasury, all the collected fees could be used to buy AAVE or Staked AAVE on the market and distributed to stakers.
II)	Treasury :
The idea of the treasury is to get a DAO growing fund in addition to the ecosystem reserve. The first fees generated will start generate interests with a farming strategy allowing the DAO to compound interests earned in order to fill the treasury faster.
The treasury could have several use cases:

Incentivize Devs building up on top of Aave
Incentivize Non Devs community members
Additional Safety in case of short fall event
Additional Incentive for stakers
Create a DAO farming fund with credit delegation
Others possibilities …
As the funds will rise every time with compounding, the interest could be spent like this:
50% of interests used to buy AAVE and send it to stakers
50% compounded to raise treasury and interests to stakers

III)	Use and distribution of the ecosystem reserve  :
The ecosystem will not last forever, and so, we’re betting on the fact that revenues that come from the protocol fees will earn more than incentive once ER is done. So, in order to play safe, this reserve should last a couple years.
This is a new potential decreasing distribution of the Ecosystem Reserve over 4 years, considering both SM and staking would start in November but it could be later.
image1008×448 74.9 KB
As mentioned in a previous comment, stakers should earn more $AAVE, because they keep the SM running and a safe protocol.
Moreover, liquidity providers earn $BAL + fees from the pool + the LP % in the estimation above. This should be more than enough to prevent any impermanent loss, which should already be low because of the 80% AAVE/20% ETH Ratio.
According to other projects with liquidity mining, there is between 0.005% and 0.02% of the supply allocated every week for LP, which is less than the rate for year 1 as (500*7)/16M *100 = 0.021%
If we incentivize more, this could bring farmers, so potential price dump.
However, you can see there is a third use for ER (Bonus compound earned AAVE into SM) explained in the next point.
There are also 498000 $AAVE remaining, I know finding how to spend money is not the hardest part, but here is some ideas:

Airdrop for every address that used AAVE before migration and migrated Lend
Airdrop to stakers
Credit delegation if we get Staked AAVE market to use it as collateral
Reward the community
Additional safety in case of short fall event
Burn

IV) Aligned interests between Stakers, Liquidity Providers and the protocol :
The more AAVE there is in the safety module the better, and as @stani mentioned it several times, we need to keep the incentive aligned with stakers and LP, while keep protecting the protocol.
The main issue to incentivize LP is the risk of them selling rewards, which could create a down pressure on the $AAVE token. However we can’t make them stake the rewards, but we can incentivize the ones who does.
This where the bonus for compounding $AAVE interests into the SM come in: In the simulation above, the bonus for the LP is the same than the bonus for compounding. This bonus is shared equally between stakers and LP (50/50).
Which means, LP’s could decide to earn more by staking the LP rewards, and so become stakers. Stakers could also earn more by choosing the compounding option, everybody wins.
I believe we could add a function “compounding” for the stakers, and they would earn the bonus every week or month if the function still activated at the end, maybe even an “Auto compounding” function that claim and stake automatically? It could maybe do the same for LP if the rewards for LP are claimable into Aave, and otherwise a system with snapshot could work.
Maybe @Emilio can tell us if this seems technically possible?
If yes, it might motivate people to stake a lot more, which would increase safety for the protocol and increase rewards for everyone.
V)	Migration dead line :
At the time of writing, there is 69% of lend migrated, so there is approximately 403M Lend left to migrate.

Left in exchange : Around 30M
Tokens in LP : Around 25M
aLend waiting for swap : Around 156M
It’s reasonable to consider these will migrate before end of year. If so, there would be around 192M tokens left, that’s 14.75% of the total supply, also, 1.75% was burned, so more like 13% left.
According to the big amount of addresses with no movement and a fixed amount that seems to be ICO participations and most of those are probably lost.
Considering all of this, I think it’s reasonable to set up a dead line by end of year, which leaves still 2.5 months for the 13% latecomer to wake up and migrate, if the funds are retrievable.

VI)	Positive impacts on $AAVE token and rewards overview :
In order to be able to protect the protocol, we need to increase the scarcity, and a good price action this goes by:

Keeping the ER to incentivize Stakers and LP instead of using it to fill the treasury
Create a bonus to incite people to stake rewards instead of selling
Using the fees to buy $AAVE on the markets without forcing people to pay fees with $AAVE
Reduce incentives over the years for both LP and stakers
Use the Staked Aave as collateral to generate more funds for the DAO without selling ER
Set up a migration dead line to reduce the supply

Rewards overview:
Stakers could earn:

$AAVE staking rewards (5x more than now distributed year 1)
Fees (in $AAVE?)
Bonus from compounding (in $AAVE)
Interest from treasury (in $AAVE or stablecoins?)
Yield from DAO farming funds (in Stablecoins?)

LP could earn:

$AAVE rewards
$BAL rewards
Fees from the Balancer pool
Bonus from compounding (in $AAVE) – (If so, this add all the stakers earning above  )

Thank you everyone for taking time to review this proposal, really looking forward to the opinion of the Aave community on every topics, and I can’t wait to see the finale AIP dealing with all of this! 
Proposal co-written with @EmmanuelD",205,2851.0,2020-10-19
['ARC - Fees & Rewards: How to improve the $AAVE token value?'],Nothing to add here from my side. Looking solid and not extreme in any way. Happy to see such a good proposal. Still interested in the opinion from the team.,133,181.6,2020-10-14
['ARC - Fees & Rewards: How to improve the $AAVE token value?'],"This is a great talk and a great proposal!
From a purely technical perspective, V2 will feature something that is not currently available on V1: What is commonly called the reserve factor, or as other lending protocols implement the feature, a percentage of the depositors accrued interest is reserved as protocol treasury.
One important distinction that the V2 implementation will have compared to the competing protocols, is that the percentage of the interest reserved to the treasury will be minted to the governance in the form of aTokens. Eg
Considering for USDC a reserve factor of 10%:

an user borrows 1000 USDC
after one year, the user accrues 100 USDC of interest on top of the 1000 USDC debt
The borrower repays: Depositors will receive 90 USDC, 10 aUSDC get minted to the governance (can either be the governance contract or the current AAVE vault)

Other protocols just keep the reserve treasury in the protocol itself, either available to borrow (which generates more interest) or sitting there doing nothing. Receiving aTokens might seems a subtle difference but this allows many cool things:

The AAVE governance actually becomes participant to the protocol itself, accruing interest on the treasury and directly receiving flashloans premiums
Leveraging the V2 credit delegation capabilities, multiple interesting possibilities open:


The governance might delegate borrowing power to farming strategies to actually earn from liquidity mining
The governance might use the treasury to allow the issuance of grants (in the form of delegated credit) for the ecosystem growth
The governance might use the interest accrued by the treasury to improve various other aspects (eg grant gasless transactions to the protocol users or for the voting, generate liquidity to cover oracles costs, etc)

This alone will probably be game changing for the AAVE governance itself. Having a treasury that can be actually leveraged for growth is for sure something that can speedup the advancements of the AAVE ecosystem.
This adds on top of everything that was proposed by @dydmoon. From a protocol perspective, it is possible to add fees in various functionalities that are unique to Aave and a value added for the users.
Regarding the AAVE distribution and staking:

Blockquote I believe we could add a function “compounding” for the stakers, and they would earn the bonus every week or month if the function still activated at the end, maybe even an “Auto compounding” function that claim and stake automatically? It could maybe do the same for LP if the rewards for LP are claimable into Aave, and otherwise a system with snapshot could work.

Although the governance will decide what the distribution for protocol LPs will be, it’s important to note that the incentives distribution smart contracts that have been developed for V2 already have a positive incentive feeback built in: staking your LPs rewards in the SM can be obtained directly with a positive bonus in AAVE.
I probably missed some points so waiting for your feeback!",138,187.6,2020-10-14
['ARC - Fees & Rewards: How to improve the $AAVE token value?'],"Hi Dydymoon,
Very nice and complete post ! I believe each one of the topics should be discussed separately as they are all equally important.
However, on this post I would like to focus on the Migration. I start seeing here and there exchanges about this topic and community willingness to put a deadline (and sometimes very short ones, maybe hoping to scalp some % on small and less aware hands).
I might miss things here, but what value does it brings to add a dealine?
As an example: It takes 2 secondes to search in reddit to see Tezos as an example where some people still asking how to unlock investment 3 years after ICO - I am not justifying the project here, just saying that people are different.
There is as many reasons to invest as there is investors/ community members. Of course most of us reading and writing here are spending slightly more time than others on the rabbit hole, but we cannot punish, blame and steal from others for being absent.
The questions are:
Are we building tools for the mass or for early well aware crypto geeks only?
Are we trying to un-bank people or steal from them? ***
Is it really democratic to vote on this topic ?(I could easily see deviance here.)
Decentralised and fair is not equal.
What is our Ethos?
I believe as a duty to keep the migration open-end. We changed the token and the rules on the way so the burden shouldn’t be on investor’s hands.
*** A small shortcut here but small wallets might find it not even relevant to migrate due to gas costs.
TL/DR: Only crypto gods know why some people joined the project, but we cannot expect everyone to follow closely development and to read governance forum to express their opinion on the matter. Imagine if there is one single person who put 10$ on Lend which for some might be expensive and there, WE should not vote on his fate to keep his money(reduce supply) or not just because he couldn’t (or wouldn’t) pay for the migration today or because he didn’t open twitter/telegram in 5 months.

['ARC - Fees & Rewards: How to improve the $AAVE token value?'],"Totally agree with you. Why do we need a time line? If nobody is going to migrate the supply will always be low. So doesn’t matter if we force to close it or just leave it open.
Everyone should have the chance to migrate. And even if the community wants to see a deadline it should be at least 1 year from now on.",99,94.8,2020-10-14
['ARC - Fees & Rewards: How to improve the $AAVE token value?'],"This is a very interesting proposal and once V2 is out, it should be put to a vote to implement some or all of the points elaborated in the AIP.
One very important thing to note is the time frame that we are looking at and what the protocol is capable of accomplishing long-term.
There is a case to be made that Aave treasury can be used as an investment vehicle operated by Aave stakeholders. V2 is the real catalyst for attracting liquidity into the protocol and in terms of liquidity amounts I believe we’ve seen nothing yet compared to what will be achieved in 2 years from now.
Just as a simple example, echoing one of the points in the proposal, at 100 billion TVL with an average weighted interested of about 2% per year, the protocol can bring the depositors about 2 billion in interest. 10% of this interest can be diverted to the Aave Treasury, which means 200 million in liquidity per year available for investments in promising established companies or startups, vetted by Aave stakeholder who can take on the role of Venture Capitalists as well. With so many people coming into the space from different industries the knowledge base for investment purposes expands considerably and becomes an very valuable asset in maximizing the number of long-term winners picked by the treasury.
I believe a separate more detailed proposal has to be made in this sense and now it is not the time for it, as the protocol still has to gain critical mass. Yet we must nurture a vision that brings more than money to the token holders, that provides Aave stakeholders with the ability to change the world by stimulating financially organizations in sectors such as healthcare, biotech, renewable energy, AI that will be ultimately the bedrock of the 21st century societies.",98,84.6,2020-10-14

On the other hand, it is still essential to know the exact circulating supply of aave. We calculated that there was roughly 13% of potentially non-swap lend after migrating from centralized exchanges. How many are lost? I do not know.
What I know is that the less there is aave the more rare and therefore expensive it is.
We can also offer an additional period where the lend would be swap against aave with a ratio of 101: 1 or 105: 1 for 3 more months to encourage people to hurry up.

The reserve factor is a very good news, that’s awesome !
Possibilities with V2 are so cool, and i believe there is a lot more to come, can’t wait 
What do you mean by the current AAVE vault ?
Just to be sure i got this right, is there some kind of bonus in AAVE already implemented into V2 ? 
My question about auto compounding was more on a technical side like is it possible to do the same that Harvest profits sharing, when you have to tick “auto-copounding” so there is no claim & restake anymore. Could this be implemented into Aave interface ?
Hi @Sunshine, @EzR3aL, thank you for the feeds back.
The dead line is usefull because there is no need for lend to keep existing as it as no use to the ecosystem anymore.
The migration is already announced for quite some time now, and there is still 2.5 month to come before EOY.
Also you’re right we cant blame people for not following discussions on the forums, but if you ask me,  every person who DHOR should at least check a few times a year the progression of his investment and project, the migration was posted everywhere on Aave channels.
Even if the remaining 13% are not all lost (which is also possible when you check all the old address probably from ICO with numbers like 100K lend that were never moved ), they still get time to swap it.
As @EmmanuelD said, we could add a decay period that reduce the amount of AAVE you get with LEND, which would leave a few month left, but this should not change much and i believe 1 year is really to much time to really move on with $AAVE token only.
Hey @oaksprout, thank you, and no you’re right it’s not an AIP,  like i said in my last sentence, it’s only what we would love to see as an AIP once finished. :)

I am talking with the support. In the meanwhile I want to start a disscussion to stop the thief from getting the still in cooldown 6k stkAAVE.
I have concluded the hacker only had access to my aave and eth fund. Because I had 7m usd at that address 0x8135908BbcB583D65978acCFe3Da6cA927185Eb1 yet the hacker only took 450k of aave and 3.5eth to his address 0xD7C40C252cAEBfeA30A02cDC648Bf5CF8Cb690e1. I have emptied the funds after the hack. Anyone can check my story.
That means if I am right, anyone who have given permission to aave.com is at rist of losing all the aave and eth.
So I propose to extend the cooldown time of the stolen stkAAVE to prevent the hacker getting funds until the investigation concludes. As according to our policy “The cooldown period by default is 10 days, but this can be further extended by the governance.”, it is possible even without a voting.

['I am willing to donate half of the stolen 6.2k aave funds to the community. Or freeze them forever. Just to catch the hacker'],"Hello Peter,
Every hack is a personal tragedy and I’m deeply sorry for your loss.
The Aave genesis team does not hold any admin key or control the AAVE token contract, after looking at your account there’s no evidence of link between approving the Aave contracts and your situation.
The staking contract has been audited by 2 reputable companies and no vulnerabilities were found. It also continues to securely hold nearly $200M worth of staked AAVE. The actions of the hackers are not originated from a contract.
The actions of the hacker have been directly signed by your wallet private key, hence, the most probable scenario is that your metamask wallet private key has been compromised.
The hacker decided for reasons unknown to all but him to take only your AAVE, StkAAVE, and some ETH, this actor is in full control of your StkAAVE, modifying the COOLDOWN_SECONDS of the safety module will have no effect on the fact that he owns all your AAVE and will not modify the situation in your favor.
To prevent this in the future, I would recommend securing your assets with a hardware wallet such as Ledger. You can find info on their website here",149,159.8,2020-11-17
['I am willing to donate half of the stolen 6.2k aave funds to the community. Or freeze them forever. Just to catch the hacker'],"Thanks MarcZeller,
But I am not convinced. I do not believe my private key is compromised as I myself is an IT guy. The hacker would not only take the 400k usd aave with a cool down period while there are 7m usd assets without cool down. And the hacker has started cooldown in order to cash the stkAAVE as soon as possible, and is claiming the aave rewards generated by the stolen stkAAVE, which is only less than100usd. It is obviously not a generous hacker.
Having audited does not guarentee security, just as BZRX did.
If aave could not protect the assets in time while it is still in control by aave, I will utilize every resource I have to start the legal process to sue aave and track down the hacker. Let the jury decide. Because if I am right, everyone’s assets are at risk. The hacker is just waiting for the right time and target. Acturally, this hacking happened just two days before cooldown ends and I would have sold my aave. (I initiated cooldown 8 days before the hacking in order to withdraw the stkAAVE).
As per the Migration and Staking - FAQ, “The cooldown period by default is 10 days, but this can be further extended by the governance.” I think the governance has the right to extending the cooldown period to protect the fund. Even the vote is required to extend the hacker’s stkAAVE, we still have time. 7 days. We should have a quick action. There must be a way of doing this otherwise the business model should be banned.
Further, I don’t think cooldown is the cause of being hacked because eth in my wallet was not in cooldown (but maybe eth is different from erc20). The stolen assets have only one common factor: I have given permmission to aave.com to spend. And all the unstolen assets have the same factor: permmission were not given to aave.com
I know many of you may think the hacker might be myself. So I suggest to extend the cooldown at least when we figure our a way to clear all things out. I can reveal my identity. Besides, what I can gain from a permernent cooldown, why I take the trouble to move out all the funds after the hack?
Not personal, MarcZeller. Thanks for any discussion.",138,57.6,2021-05-03

Please be advised there is evidence that your wallet and/or private key was compromised. The transactions were performed and signed by your address. Thus it follows, either you performed these transactions, or someone used your private key.
Furthermore, your assertion that your remaining tokens were not stolen and thus this is proof of a hack, does not hold water. Actually this was likely because etherscan shows those tokens with a $0 value. The hack you have suffered is not technically complex, as it only requires access to your private key or wallet.
Regarding your statement that the transfer was performed from Aave protocol or contract, this is wrong the token transaction is a “transfer” function, which can only be triggered by your own address:

If this was performed based on the allowance for a contract it would be a “transferFrom” function instead.
In addition ETH is not an asset you can allow a contract to transfer on your behalf so not even Aave contract could perform an ETH transfer by allowance as you propose:

Please be advised there is evidence that your wallet and/or private key was compromised. The transactions were performed and signed by your address. Thus it follows, either you performed these transactions, or someone used your private key.
==》No, that is why we need to investigate and figure out who and how did it. That is why hacking happens. Something only hacker knows and is able to do until further investigation concludes. Like when a bank is hacked, you could not say only the bank employee can do.

Actually this was likely because etherscan shows those tokens with a $0 value. The hack you have suffered is not technically complex, as it only requires access to your private key or wallet.
===>A hacker would not miss the money in a wallet. Most of the ERC20 token’s value in etherscan is $0 value, and even in the transaction the hacker stole 6k aave from my address to his shows the value is $0 too. But any one without any experience can check the balance of any address in any of the defi investment tools such as zapper.fi or debank.com or zerion.io, etc.

====>I tested in aave.com, that only AAVE and ETH can be spended (actually I tested deposit) without spending limit permission. ETH does not seem to need to give permission. Therefore the correct words should be: both stolen assets (AAVE and ETH) share in common that spending permission does not need to be given to AAVE.COM when AAVE.COM spends them.

====>It can be cleared out this way: you must have noticed the hacker has initiated cooldown and is actively claiming the aave rewards everyday. It is clear he is anxious to cash the stolen assets. If we extend the cooldown, he will have to reach out to aave in order to cash the fund. Then aave can explain and identify who he is. If he never shows up then he is the hacker. Then we can discuss what to do next.
With all this, if aave could not protect the fund, I will report to financial authority and sue aave at the court of law. This is not a way of doing business. Even the admin keys are in governance’s hand and need a vote, then did aave initiate the vote? Even the vote denies my proposal, there must be a way to deal with such issue. Otherwise this business model should not exist.
Further I would like to add two new suggestion.  1.To deposit 1m usd in aave as collateral. 2. Donate the funds to any orgnization, include Charities. Aave can name one. Thus, I have provided four suggestions to earn your (AAVE’s) trust. To sum up:
1)Donate half of the stolen tokens, which is about 220,000usd.
2)Freeze them.
3)I provide collateral about twice of the stolen tokens. If I have any wrong doings or cause any harm to AAVE, the collateral will be disposed by aave.
4)Donate part or all of the funds to any organization under AAVE’s discretion and public monitoring (to ensure the fund is actually be donated to the organization). I suggest to donote to UNICEF (www.unicef.org). Please help me to fulfil this dream. It can be executed by AAVE so make sure the fund is going to UNICEF.
Hope we do not have to go to the police or court or financial authority just because of a hacker. Or you and your team can figure out any ways to do so. I will cooperate.
Even if my wallet is compromised,  AAVE.com as a financial service provider, has responsibility to protect client’s assets. After all, hacking is a crime, if it completed because AAVE’s inaction, AAVE might become an accomplice of the hacking crime.

['I am willing to donate half of the stolen 6.2k aave funds to the community. Or freeze them forever. Just to catch the hacker'],"Dear Peter,
We are happy to help you to clarify what happened, but as pointed several times, this is not something to do with Aave, your wallet private key or wallet was compromised.  Regarding the funds not taken, this is not something up to a subjective evaluation, the hacker actually missed those funds, stkAAVE shows its value in etherscan as you can see:

The liquidity token you moved valued in 4M$ shows none value in etherscan:

But anyway this is not something subjective, as pointed the wallet is compromised, tokens were moved with “transfer” and ETH was moved (it does not have any allowance possible) those movements were performed by your address.
Both transactions performed as previously communicated were performed by your address, the stkAAVE is a “transfer” function, is not based on any allowance.
And regarding ETH, ETH is not an asset you can allow as an ERC20 token, you can’t give allowance to an address to move your ETH, Aave protocol has not allowance to move your ETH on your behalf, it is technically impossible, your ETH was moved by your address as it is compromised, same way as your tokens.
About your request about extending the cooldown, Aave genesis team can’t extend the cooldown by itself or take any actions, admin keys are in aave token holder’s hands and any change as that requires an on-chain voting process to happen.
Also as pointed in previous communications, your wallet is compromised is impossible to prove the legitimacy of the hack, it was done by your wallet address by you or by someone with your private key or wallet access.
About the suggestion of donating, freezing, providing collateral, or any other similar action, any of those not prove the legitimacy of the action, it is not possible to demonstrate based on the transactions that is was a hack or perform by yourself based on an agreement between parties or any similar action so none of these suggestions help or solve this in any sense.
Aave protocol is decentralized thus us as genesis team we have no responsibility over this as we’re not a custodian of your assets.",106,21.2,2020-11-23

['I am willing to donate half of the stolen 6.2k aave funds to the community. Or freeze them forever. Just to catch the hacker'],"Yes, @cryptix, the hacker took 6231 stkAAVE

The eth followed the same pattern.
The problem is that all these transactions were not done by me. I was sleeping when the first transaction happened. Phishing is not possible. And when the last transaction happened, I realised something was wrong and contacted AAVE support.
I could not figure out why he did this but that means he at least controlled my account for 14 hours. He definitely had time to figure out I had 7m usd in that account. But he did not touch.
But now, I think the first time he took the fund in order to see if he was able to take the fund.  He transfered the fund back to my account in hope that I would not be alerted of hacking so that he can have time to see if he can take my other money. Then when he tried 14 hours and found he could only take stkAAVE and ETH, he did that and went away. Just my guess.
Also be advised that, it took me 6 hours to empty my account (after the last hacking transaction), the hacker was just sitting there without any actions. Because he could only take stkAAVE and ETH, which do not need approval.",91,18.2,2020-11-25

Paragraph Summary
Badger is a governance token while bBadger is the token that represents one’s position in the Badger Sett on app.badger.finance and is indicative of a user’s partial ownership of the assets within the vault.
Currently, the TVL across all Setts is $[2.2b] (app.badger.finance), primarily in BTC via CRV LP tokens and our wBTC paired vaults.
We Propose AAVE lists the output token of the Badger Sett, bBADGER as collateral on AAVE V2 for borrowing and lending.
Motivation
Connect Badger’s User Base to aaves: Badger brings along with it a vibrant community of [9,500] holders (source) and [11,000]+ community members, known as Badgers, on Discord.
Increased TVL for Aave: This proposal will allow the Aave TVL to expand and will allow the Badger community to borrow other Assets against their $bBadger tokens, and further build out the DeFi “lego building block” stack and allow 9,500+ bBADGER holders to earn an additional layer of yield through borrowing and lending.

I am BitcoinPalmer a member of BadgerDAO


Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token


Badger is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) focused on building the products and infrastructure necessary to accelerate Bitcoin as collateral across other blockchains. Specifically, it is an ecosystem DAO where projects and people from across DeFi can come together to collaborate and build the products DeFi needs. Shared ownership in the DAO incentivizes builders to have aligned objectives while decentralized governance ensures that those incentives remain fair to all parties and that the projects pursued are determined by the community.


Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?


The current yield on bBadger stands around [85]% APY with over $[275m] locked in the Sett Vaults, making this an ideal productive asset as collateral.


Provide a brief history of the project and how it overcame stressed conditions


The BadgerDAO was bootstrapped by the seeding team before launching an Early Contributors Program in october of 2020. This led to Badger’s first two products, the Sett, an automated DeFi aggregator focused on tokenized BTC assets, and Digg, a non-custodial synthetic Bitcoin on Ethereum. Sett was launched on December 3, 2020, and Digg was launched on January 22nd, 2021. Since then Badger has overcome the native issues with creating a DAO structure, and non critical UI/UX bugs on the Sett vaults. We rallied our badgers to provide alternative community UI while the core team worked on issues with the native app. Our saving grace to overcoming obstacles is and will always be our community.


How is the asset currently used?


bBADGER is the productive asset of the Governance token (BADGER) aside from this core function, bBADGER has been listed on CREAM for borrowing and lending.

['Proposal: Add a PieDAO secondary market'],"Summary
PieDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization governing tokenized portfolio allocations. The DAO is focused on bringing market accessibility and economic empowerment to anyone with an internet connection through tokenized asset allocations. These ETF products known as PIEs are collectively governed by DAO members. DOUGH token holders are the DAO’s decision-makers and will be incentivized via a revenue stream from generated fees.
Proposal
Add support for the following assets as a PieDAO secondary market on Aave




#

1
DEFI+L - DeFi Large Cap Pie


2
DEFI+S - DeFi Small Cap Pie

DEFI++ - DeFi Pie

$DeFi+L, $DeFi+S, $DeFi++, $BCP and $YPIE are Pies governed by PieDAO and represented by ERC20 tokens, providing exposure to the best projects of the DeFi ecosystem. Each underlying asset allocated in these Pies is fully collateralized, meaning that holding these Pies provides complete ownership of the underlying assets represented, ensuring the risk mitigation of a diversified index fund through a convenient single token.
Pies are generally modelled following our own Correlated Risk-Adjusted Market Cap methodology, which weigh each underlying asset’s allocation starting from its 30 Day Average Circulating Market Cap. A % max allocation is recursively selected through stress tests run to avoid possible scaling bottlenecks.
Additionally allocations may be averaged through the computation of a Sentiment Score, assessing each underlying asset’s merits in Innovation, Functionality to the DeFi Ecosystem and Growth Potential. This process is more extensively covered here
PieDAO recently introduced PieVaults, a new product range that can productively use the underlying assets across DeFi protocols. PieVaults maximise productivity and unlock multiple additional benefits for their holders such as Meta-governance, Lending Bouncing and Native Staking. Multiple strategies can be employed, e.g. lending one asset while staking another.
With Meta-Governance the DOUGH token is becoming a passport for governance across the entire DeFi ecosystem, with holders able to vote gas-free via Snapshot.
Our full proposal can be found here, including an extensive risk analysis for each of the asset proposed, to better highlight for each Pie:

the correlation of its underlying constituents through a Correlation Matrix
their Equal Risk, assessing the assets’ covariance and overall Pie standard deviation as a measure of its risk, also highlighting the Marginal Contributions to Risk (MCTR) of each underlying asset to the Pie’s overall risk.

Decrypt – 22 Oct 20



Wrapped Zcash is Coming to Ethereum’s DeFi Ecosystem - Decrypt
Thanks to a new Zcash-Ethereum bridge, ZEC holders will be able to use their coins on decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms as WZEC.





With the recent news of WZEC enabled through the Wrapped platform hosted by Anchorage + Tokensoft, Zcash holders now have two avenues to bridge their ZEC onto Ethereum: RenZEC and WZEC.
At the moment, 4,122 renZEC (coingecko #) and 9,001 WZEC exist in circulation within Ethereum, bringing the total market cap of ZEC within DeFi to ~ $752,199 (marked to a current ZEC price of $56.89). This represents just 0.127% of the total ZEC marketcap.
One major roadblock holding back increased bridging of ZEC is the fact that the only real option for use at the moment is pooling through a DEX such as Uniswap, Balancer, or Sushiswap as an LP. While the accrual of fees providing liquidity to an AMM may be attractive for some longer-term LP’s, many prefer to avoid the possibility of IL associated with acting as a short term LP, thus limiting the attractiveness in bridging ZEC for a broader subset of users.
AAVE has the opportunity to be the premier platform for Zcash holders seeking to put their dormant assets to work. Adding WZEC and RenZEC would provide benefit for:
(i) Ethereum on the whole - bridging more native layer 1 assets onto the Ethereum blockchain and increasing DeFi TVL, and
(ii) AAVE specifically as the main hub for bridged Zcash lending, increasing AAVE’s platform TVL and usage.
While the move may seem preemptive, ZEC is a longstanding name with a strong team and total marketcap exceeding half a billion dollars. The first platform to act on enabling ZEC lending within DeFi on Ethereum presents a unique opportunity to become the defacto lending hub as a first mover. At the same time, the ability to lend via DeFi would incentive ZEC holders to bridge their coins over and put them to work. For these reasons, I propose the addition of both WZEC and RenZEC to the AAVE platform.

I’m supportive of adding support for renZEC. There are many Storage of Value type token (whether privacy or not), but many of them tend to have fostered a maxi-type culture. From my experience interacting with the ZEC community, they give off a much more open-minded and positive energy.
I can’t comment on wZEC as I haven’t reviewed or assessed their custodial design and potential risk. (Not saying they are risky, I just haven’t looked into it myself).

Similarly now we have renZEC which has been out there for a while, and with wZEC recently coming out, a Curve pool for renZEC/wZEC, and some integrations for both wrapped ZECs, we can see volumes exploding likewise (although ofc not as much as with BTC).

['Request for Brainstorm : Thoughts on Money Market powered Governance Attack'],"Governance attack
One of the premises of decentralized governance is that token holders will act in good faith as they are holding assets and thus are exposed to the consequences of the decisions and votes they make.
This is for example the rationale behind the Maker Emergency Shutdown module, which requires to burn a consequent amount of MKR in order to shutdown the maker protocol. As of today the amount of MKR in Aave isn’t enough to trigger the emergency shutdown but the last thing we should want for the protocol is that the growing interest from the Maker community in using Aave puts the Maker Protocol and DAI, an essential building block of our ecosystem, at risk.
Beyond Maker, it’s all the decentralized governance ecosystem which can fall victim to such an attack. The closest exemple to such a governance attack is what happened with the Steem blockchain with centralized exchanges getting involved. Not your tokens, not your protocol.
This was an influence based attack, but a whale backed attack in DeFi would look like someone using ETH as collateral to borrow YFI, MKR, UNI or Aave in order to propose and pass a malicious proposal. This is a threat that makes governance aware and risk averse stakeholders reluctant to use protocols such as Aave since, as they use their token as collateral, someone else can borrow those tokens for governance attack.
Voting with aTokens
aTokens are the representations of your deposits in the Aave protocol.
To prepare the ongoing token migration, LEND borrowing was blocked which also enabled the use of aLEND as a voting asset, since double voting was not possible as the underlying LEND could not be borrowed.
This was a success and open now the possibility for other protocols to support aTokens votings.
If the underlying token can’t be borrowed, then risk averse stakeholders could vote in their respective governance using aTokens if the protocol supports it (As they should!)
aUNI, aMKR, aAave and aYFI could be used for both governance in their respective protocol and leverage in Aave.
Regarding the Aave governance, it seems clear that it can’t allow voting with aAave if Aave can be borrowed as it opens to a “leverage governance attack” : e.g. a holder of 100 AAVE could deposit it into the protocol, getting 100 AAVE. Somebody else (or himself, but lower amount) could then borrow the 100 AAVE. At this point, from 100 AAVE, 200 “units of voting power” have been created. Even considering from the governance that the supply to measure voting power from should be 200 (AAVE+aAAVE), in practice, a person doing this kind of leverage by himself will just “boost” his voting power compared with plain AAVE holders not leveraging.
Enabling aToken support also solves the difficult of calculating the proper combined supply and with it percentage over it: e.g. in a potential scenario where to submit a proposal to the Aave governance is needed a percentage of combined AAVE+aAAVE+stkAAVE supply, the fair calculation of this percentage is more complex than just using the AAVE supply (as non-deposited AAVE supply + aAAVE supply = AAVE supply).
For the previous reasons, there are two points of discussion/solutions proposed for this thread, with complete openness for others appearing:


Not enabling AAVE and UNI as borrowing assets on the Aave protocol and disabling MKR and YFI, while pushing for those protocols to support aUNI, aYFI and aMKR voting.


Setting a global borrowing limit on those assets in the Aave protocol, considering the governance voting thresholds, and taking this limit into account on the calculation of voting power.


This thread is inspired and consequential to the discussion/polling with positive outcome here Aave Protocol Token Addition - Community Sentiment Poll , and Proposal to add AAVE as collateral only.

['Request for Brainstorm : Thoughts on Money Market powered Governance Attack'],"A couple thoughts here.
Either

Don’t make aAAVE part of the voting power but allow deposit (no interest) to use as collateral only. Staking is the “interest bearing” incentive, don’t offer interest on deposited AAVE used as collateral. Just like LEND was. If deposited for use of collateral, maybe you surrender the gov voting power??
Or
In lieu of aAAVE, use stkAAVE as the function of deposit (staked aave) and borrow against the value (collateral) that is being staked = stkaave

People that “borrow” against the value have the freedom to go buy any token, in this case AAVE, #1 would easily solve the issue.
Stkaave + aave remains voting power
For stkaave collateral, If slashing can be 30% of the stake, worst case scenario… Let’s say stkaave is used as collateral up to 30% LTV, then if the collateral position of the loan drops below 1.0, the Stkaave is liquidated, and put back into the Aave reserve, similar time how slashing would work per say, continually protecting The protocol. Then stkaave can actually be “more secure” if part of the collateral pool, and could drive more to defend collateral/loan positions to ensure their staked aave isn’t liquidated
Possible? Either #1 or #2 above?
If you can’t borrow against the “value” of Aave in some form, you are eliminating a primary use case in which I (And many) was/were drawn to the platform to begin with and the concern of 1 step forward, now 2 steps back. Token use case is crucial. Governing is only a small portion of importance (to me anyway) - happens to be an added benefit to the token value, not the only value.",81,26.2,2020-10-15
['Request for Brainstorm : Thoughts on Money Market powered Governance Attack'],"Hi Jeffrey and SlaAve, thanks for your thoughts!
Let me address them in order.
Borrowing in traditional market : I agree it’s seen as poor corporate governance, but the greater threat here is that you cant really make a governance attack at the scale of a DeFi Protocol in tradFi. So the reasoning behind this proposal is to actually prevent a destructive attack on a DeFi protocol such as Maker with the ER or any other with a malicious proposal.
Weighted voting system : Possible but most likely tricky if you do something else that simply holding your tokens, needs to be researched more.
Bad governance more costly : It would still be possible, at some point over 40% of the LEND was deposited in Aave. With enough funds, anything becomes possible.
aAave not allowed to vote : I think a large majority of the voting supply would be lost with such a decision. The primary use case is not to “give up voting rights in exchange for interest” but actually to use as collateral to borrow against, hence the proposal to disable the ability to borrow AAVE.
SLaAve :


I think you misunderstood the idea. The proposal is to reproduce the same parameters as LEND, where aLEND was also a voting asset because you could only use as collateral and were not allowed to borrow LEND.


stkAAVE should also be use to vote.
Using stkAAVE as collateral would be possible (astkAAVE) but a different use case as not everyone will stake


If you can’t borrow against the “value” of Aave in some form, you are eliminating a primary use case : On the contrary, the idea here is not to stop using AAVE as collateral but to disable the possibility to borrow AAVE and ONLY use as collateral
TL:DR

By disabling the borrowing of governance tokens, users using AAVE as collateral in the platform would still be able to vote in governance matter.
The protocol would neither enable “poor governance” nor being used for what could be direct threat for the DeFi ecosystem (Maker ER)
It’s an opportunity to push aTokens as voting assets in other protocol as they will be able to leverage and vote without putting at risk their protocol

Also, any concerns about the effects of a growing mismatch in supplied/borrowed assets since you’d be adding more utility to a subset of supplied tokens while at the same time making them unborrowable?

['Request for Brainstorm : Thoughts on Money Market powered Governance Attack'],"Hi @Jordan,
Great proposal which highlights an interesting attack vector that could lead to systemic risk not just for Aave but for the crypto ecosystem more broadly. I think it’s right for the community to think carefully about how to mitigate this. Our main concern with solution 1 (removing the ability to borrow governance tokens) is the long-term effect this could have on demand for Aave’s product.
To be clear, this wouldn’t be much of a problem right now. Looking at the data, currently governance tokens make up only ~6% of total demand for borrowing on Aave.

Interestingly, if we exclude stablecoins and ETH, governance tokens make up ~45% of total demand for borrowing on Aave.
734×409 7.71 KB

Crucially, as my colleague @YanDelphi pointed out earlier in this thread, banning borrowing of governance tokens will not just have consequences for borrowing demand but also for supply by creating a mismatch in supplied/borrowed assets resulting in lowered interest rates for depositors. Governance tokens currently make up about ~6.5% of deposits and ~13.4% when removing ETH and stablecoins.

While the numbers are small currently, we can also observe that governance tokens have been making up an increasing amount of borrow volume, deposit volume as well as unique addresses recently.
1238×768 41.5 KB
Our view is that while removing borrowing of governance tokens would have minimal effects on Aave right now as they represent only a small percentage of supply/demand, the longer-term effects of this can be more detrimental given the growth of governance as a sector.
Our belief is that most tokens will eventually incorporate governance functionality and thus Aave may lose market share to less risk-conscious competitors such as CREAM which allow for borrowing of governance tokens. As we mention earlier, this will not just affect demand for borrowing but also supply of assets as the mismatch of supplied/borrowed assets on Aave would mean competitors would likely be able to offer superior rates on deposits. While voting with aTokens is undoubtedly a great feature, at this point we would begin to question whether the loss in market share from banning borrowing of governance tokens is worth the added utility of allowing users to vote with their aTokens.
We feel the alternative solution of implementing a borrowing limit for governance tokens is less extreme and suffers from less of these issues. The borrowing limit could also be calculated dynamically based on governance voting thresholds and the number of active votes occurring in the various protocols. The protocols could also begin accounting for this borrowing limit in their total supply/voting power calculations. To further mitigate the loss of demand for Aave, rather than banning borrowing once the borrow limit is reached, Aave could also ban voting with aTokens once the borrowing limit is reached. This way, the attack vector is mitigated without demand suffering.
To summarise, we believe in the long-term the marginal utility of allowing users to vote with their aTokens is not worth the potential loss in demand for borrowing governance tokens, which would also have downstream consequences for governance token deposits. This is especially the case given we think governance will continue to become a more important part of the space. As such, we favour solutions that allow Aave to continue being a competitive player in supply/demand of governance tokens.",45,949.0,2020-10-23
['Request for Brainstorm : Thoughts on Money Market powered Governance Attack'],"Hey everyone 
Very interesting and important topic !
I agree about the fact that governance attack can be a real issue, however, it’s also true that it could take some cut to the protocol if borrowing governance token was disabled.
What about using StkAAVE only to vote ?
For now, StkAAVE isn’t listed so it can’t be borrowed, and @Emilio mentioned that even if we may be able to use Stkaave as a collateral, it would be on a market itself, so it may be easier to disable borrowing on this market rather than on the main market ?
We could also extend the Cooldown period to 15 days, in order to get only good intention from users that vote, because there would tokens should be locked 1 week before vote and 2 weeks after.
This way AAVE token could be borrowed but it would not be possible to vote with it unless it’s staked for some time.
For other governance tokens, it could also work with a proposition on each forum, we can already stake YFI in the governance pool to vote, so it would only require to add a bigger staking time needed to vote before and after, but i dont know the governance on Maker or other protocols (can we already stake to vote MKR, UNI ? )
Do you think voting with staked assets only could allow a better governance by getting only people involved to be able to vote (and delegations of course for those who don’t stake) or is it really complicated to set this up ?",39,32.8,2020-10-24
['Request for Brainstorm : Thoughts on Money Market powered Governance Attack'],"Very interesting topic - such important to avoid malicious votes from actors.
I think adding time lock variable into protocols voting power is also a solution.
To limit borrowing amount seems partial to me and not so effective if user can go to CREAM when limit is reached.
Also convincing the biggest ecosystem stakeholders to vote only with aTokens will be complicate.
Let’s take a look at DAO that are less subject to attack : Curve. Why so ?

You can not borrow Curve tokens on Aave. Ok but you can on CREAM. Yes but for 105% APY. Why so expensive ?
Because there is time lock. 20.8% of the total CRV supply is locked in exchange of veCRV.

Cooldown is an interesting feature to continue to dig in order to insure voters are long term skined in the game participants. imo

 Jordan:

Although great in theory, the issue here is that you cannot control DeFi as a whole. If AAVE is available to borrow elsewhere, the same flash governance attack can occur. It is also overall beneficial to allow borrowing of assets, it increases liquidity and allows for greater price discovery.
I don’t know about the borrowing limit either, since supply isn’t necessarily fixed some governance tokens. (i.e. UNI.)
If only there was a way to do something like “lock” your voting tokens for a single block, then have them returned to you afterwards. This would instantly solve the flash-loan dilemma, preventing the loan from being paid back. At least, that’s how I understand it.
As stated by @TheoRochaix, it turns out this solution is already being studied! I’m sure, if it turns out to be as efficient as anticipated, Aave will follow suit.

['Request for Brainstorm : Thoughts on Money Market powered Governance Attack'],"I agree with @YanDelphi and @jose_delphi that blocking borrows makes Aave less compelling to users.
However, how are Borrow Limits set? And as others have said, they don’t solve the problem at an ecosystem level – assume the emergence of N money markets, and the threat remains. A difficult problem emerges where you dynamically set borrow limits according to ecosystem participants, but you’re then exposed to oracle and further malicious actor issues.
Maker’s solution highlight by @TheoRochaix blocks flashloan attacks, but doesn’t block large actors from simply borrowing against their assets.

I would like to propose an alternative solution – bTokens.
bTokens are essentially the same as borrowed tokens, except they are tagged and can therefore be handled differently by governance systems. Different governance systems could experiment with their own designs but they might say, for example, that a bToken must’ve been held for a particular time. Or that for the first x weeks, a bToken only has y % of the voting power of a normal token.
Whether to lend in bTokens is a binary option, set per pool. So the UNI pool can either lend out UNI or bUNI. In my opinion, this decision should actually be made by holders of the third-party token themselves, as it principally impacts them rather than Aave.*

*if the community did opt to go down the Borrow Limits route, I’d also propose that this is configurable in large part by the holders of the deposited token. This would better-align interests with the ecosystem.",30,291.0,2020-10-30

The Flash Loan fix highlighted by @TheoRochaix actually is only a fix for Maker governance process. It doesnt fix all the other governance attack vector, and it doesnt fix the maker ER risk.

This gives users more incentive to hold KNC, but if something similar was used for Aave it would likely only benefit those with big holdings who don’t need help covering transaction costs, and again would just burn cash.

edit: I do like @Emilio’s suggestion of supporting gasToken though, this could be a decent workaround until L2’s come into fruition, but then again it may also turn out to be a waste of development if gasToken is fully implemented and then shortly after a proper L2 is available that works for Aave.",61,32.2,2020-08-01
['Gas cost discussion'],"Disadvantages:


Cost: it contains opportunity cost and money cost. For opportunity cost,it means we can use these money for better use such as incentives for liquidity pools or ecosystem building. For money cost, it means we have to put a lot of money .


Result: First, we don’t know how many additional users will be attracted by subsiding fee costs and we need build some models to evaluate. Second, For what’s the best straegy for doing this
still needs evaluate. Such as what’s the optimal point for subsize. It means if we continue to increase subsides beyond the point, less and less users are attracted than what we cost. Third, what about others imitate and compensate more than us ? Will these cause a vicious circle and increase both ethereum and dapps’ burden? Other bad results such as abusement like others point above.


Suggestions:


Why not do a questionarie and find how many users are blocked by the high gas fee（I think every one has a feeling about high gas fee but they still use Aave)?This questionarie can also include what’s the most attractive feature for them using Aave.


Optimize contract gas cost like others suggest above. Maybe oneday, the gas cost of contracts will be a competition of a dapp.


Layer 2 is not mature so I don’t think they can help at short term. But we must focus on this area cause maybe oneday a big revolution breaks.


Maybe we can consider other evm compatible blockchains. It’s not a migaration rather a duplicate backup.

 _  thoughts:


Spending the AAVE reserve on gas seems to be a low value activity for the protocol, helping out small users is great but we’re aiming to build a trillion dollar protocol over the next decade (Have to think big & long term imo).


The development overhead is definitely something worth considering - hopefully the massive gas costs will be improved over short/medium term (L2, ETH2, etc)


gasToken could be a viable middle ground.


As mentioned by DeFiDude - there could be some system where ‘by having x amount of AAVE held in the SM addresses get gas paid for’ but that just seems to help users who already have $ regardless.


Overall: Ethereum & other layer 2 techs currently have scalability as a high priority. On top of this, using traditional finance costs thousands of dollars instead of tens of dollars, seems like not a massive roadblock.",53,120.6,2020-08-04

['Gas cost discussion'],"I don’t have any data on the effectiveness itself that would definitely be better left for Marc, but I do know that both Dharma and Argent have been imposing limits and restrictions around their subsidized gas program.
For Dharma, when the gas limits were especially high they were imposing minimum swap limits of 1 ETH+ and things of that sort. Argent recently sent out an e-mail as well stating they’ll no longer be subsidizing the gas on transfers.
Given the restrictions they’ve had to impose it’s clear that it’s not a cheap way to go, but with Aave, contract interactions for a single user can exceed the gas costs of multiple regular transfers meaning it would only be much more expensive and unsustainable in Aave’s case I would think. For one user alone the act of depositing, borrowing, paying back, and withdrawing, could be upwards of $50 with the current gas prices (at least until v2 ).
I do love the idea of waiving the gas for new users following their first X number of transactions, but then comes the issues of it not being sybil resistant, so for me if I knew I was no longer going to get fee-free transactions I’d just transfer my stuff to a new address and then use Aave for the no fees.",34,86.8,2020-08-27

['ARC: Incentivizing higher Health Factors'],"Hello everyone,
This post is meant to be more of a brainstorming one as this is not a fully backed proposal.
The idea is to incentive with AAVE rewards the upholding of the Health Factor at higher levels pertaining to collateral providers. Consider the scenario of borrowing DAI against ETH at an initial HF of 2. Over time ETH appreciates  and the HF becomes 3. That means of course the borrowing position is healthier and therefore the system as a whole is a bit safer. Well in this case the borrower might very well decide that they have leeway to borrow more and why not bring the HF to 2 again, after all they do not earn anything by keeping it at 3 and it actually comes as an opportunity cost.
However if they received AAVE rewards for reaching a HF of 3 they might rethink their strategy and keep the HF at 3 since there are incentives to do so.
This way the overall trend for Health Factors across borrowers would strengthen even more while the AAVE system would diminish the debt associated risks.

ARC : Put the treasury to work Governance


    Hello everyone ! 
Happy to see that the community like the ARC with 35 votes Yes, i just closed the vote to let the poll one month. 
In a month, treasury has growth from 290k to approximately 680k, i’m really happy to see this grow every day. 
As migration from V1 to V2 is not done yet, i don’t know if it’s better to transfer the funds in several times to the reserve factor address or to wait that all funds have migrated to transfer it all at once ?

['ARC : Put the treasury to work'],"Hey Aave Fam !
As you probably know, the governance is accumulating fees from the protocol V1 and V2.
Most of the fees from V1 have been transferred to the Governance address, that also receive reserve factor for V2: 0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c
Some flash loans fees remain on the V1 address and will be transferred soon, probably once the migration tool is live.
The governance currently hold around 290k, mostly in stablecoins but also in other currency, however, the numbers won’t be right once I publish as it grows all the time.
Here is a quick overview :

First, we need to transfer V1 fees to the governance address and deposit all the stablecoins on Aave. A majority is not in atokens, as it comes from V1.
Once it’s done, the treasury can start generate interests by using the Aave curve pool and the ETH/sETH curve pool.
Aave curve pool: Deposit aDAI, aUSDC and aUSDT generate 12.5% APY + 14.5% in CRV (without boost)
The treasury would earn interests accrued by Aave + trading fees from the curve pool + CRV from the gauge. By using Aave curve pool, the risk is quite low as Curve is battle tested and the liquidity remains on Aave too.
ETH/sETH curve pool: Deposit ETH and sETH from synthetix generate 0.3% APY + 34% in CRV (without boost)
The governance would earn 0.3% APY + trading fees + CRV from the gauge.
For now, the governance doesn’t hold CRV, but farm it can be a smart move to start accumulating, and the reserve factor will earn some too. Once the governance has enough, we will be able to stake those CRV to boost the APY, earn curve fees, and vote to increase the gauge for Aave pool.
The current CRV APY with max boost is 36.5% in CRV for Aave pool and 85% for ETH/sETH pool. Moreover, increasing the gauge could bring an even better APY, which will potentially increase Aave TVL.
Summary of transactions required for this strategy :

Transfer the remaining fees from V1 to the governance address
Deposit all stablecoins on Aave
Swap low balances into DAI or USDC
Deposit atokens on Aave Curve pool and stake into the gauge
Deposit ETH into ETH/sETH Curve pool and stake into the gauge

About other tokens such as BTC, YFI… it’s probably better to let it grow for now as the balances are quite low, and with L2 coming soon, the governance will be able to swap or deposit these tokens as a collateral for a much lower gas price.
I can’t wait to hear your opinions about this ! :)

['ARC : Put the treasury to work'],"+1 on the proposal. Two key points from my perspective on why it is a good idea:

First, like @Dydymoon mentions, in this case, the additional risk on the protocol is 0, as it’s just the treasury who decides to allocate its own funds in some productive place. From the point of view of risk on the treasury, of course the nature of Curve itself has some inherent risks (mainly the stablecoins being on peg), but the reward is probably worth it.
Second, there is a clear synergy between the Aave and Curve communities (last weeks the CRV governance token has been listed on Aave), so makes sense for the Aave protocol to try to have a voice on Curve too.

Interestingly, the assets are generate from v2 Reserve Factor are minted in aTokens, which means that the treasury has some automated treasury management to start with, and then it’s a question of how to increase the yield without taking much additional risk (hence diversification in future is something that the community should consider).
What I like to add is that over time the protocol treasury starts to grow and there might be interesting ways to use the treasury for the benefit of the users in the protocol as well. I could imagine that the treasury could become a counter-party in fixed term loans for Aave borrowers, meaning higher yield for the treasury compared to aTokens reserve yield.",39,52.8,2021-01-22

['Proposal: Add support for $OCEAN Token'],"Hello Aave family,
I’m Bruce Pon, co-founder of Ocean Protocol. I’d like to make a proposal for Aave to support OCEAN as a collateral asset. We think being able to lend and borrow OCEAN on Aave would open up several exciting opportunities for both Ocean and Aave.
Why aOCEAN?
OCEAN, the native token of the Ocean Protocol is already a well traded token with average daily trading volume in excess of $20m and tradable on many major CEX like Binance, Poloniex, Gateio, Bittrex, and Kucoin. But more importantly, it has very sizable liquidity on Defi platforms like Uniswap, Balancer, Ban and Kyber. We will be collaborating with more partners in Defi space.
With our recent Ocean v3 launch, we have moved firmly into the Defi space and a natural progression is to create an OCEAN lending market. We can’t think of a better place to do this than with the Aave community. Being able to borrow and lend OCEAN would enable holders to collateralize their OCEAN.
To seed this OCEAN lending market on Aave, the Ocean Protocol Foundation is ready to commit to 1 Million OCEAN tokens (approx. $400,000 USD), along with contributions from our strong community of OCEAN hodlers.
The Future: Collateralizing Data Assets with Aave <> Ocean
Besides developing an OCEAN lending market, there are other more interesting initiatives that we’re excited to develop with the Aave community. As of today, Ocean Protocol has over $1 million TVL in our datatoken pools.
Our datatokens are ERC20 tokens and each of them are underlying assets of their own data market. We see a vivid future where each of these datatokens can have their own lending market on Aave. This will be groundbreaking for both Ocean and Aave because Aave will be the first lending protocol that collateralizes real world data with efficiency and scale.
Other collaborations that might be interesting for the Aave community is to source curated data from Ocean Protocol marketplaces to be able optimise the lending rates and possibly provide under-collateralized loans. Aave community may also choose to monetise the data Aave platform generates to fund the platform and to incentivize users using the platform.
There are multiple collaborations that both Ocean and Aave communities can work out. Extremely excited to build such a future together.

['Listing Proposal: Add xSUSHI'],"Summary :
Proposal by Sushiswap team
SUSHI
xSUSHI is the governance token of Sushiswap, a community-led DEX with a current TVL of more than 1.1B.
xSushi is one of the two currently supported assets for Sushi governance (ETH/SUSHI SLP being the other one). We are currently not fully decentralized but the members of the Ops multisig and Treasury multisig are bound to respect all of the governance votes. We do plan to be a real DAO most likely leveraging Aragon v2 in 6 to 12 months depending on the progress made by community.
xSushi is receiving 0.05% of all the swaps happening on Sushiswap and should also benefits from all of the future revenues streams from upcoming platforms such as Bento-Miso-Gusoku-Deriswap and more.
The current yield on this asset alone is hovering around 10-40% APY with over 100m$ locked in the Sushibar making it an ideal productive asset as collateral.
Some very interesting data points can be found here :


https://sushiswapanalytics.com/bar 


https://sushi.zippo.io/sushibar


Sushi is currently only supported by the platform Cream with a 60% collateral factor.
Given the short existence of SUSHI on the market and the volatility,
I think these parameters could be considered :




LTV
Liquidation threshold
Liquidation Bonus
Reserve Factor




40%
65%
15%
20%



If this listing make sense I’d love for any Aavengers, Aave supporters and Sushi lovers to delegate some proposal power with their Aave or even better stkAAVE.

Benefits for Aave:
Aave would be the first platform to support xSushi a yield bearing asset with over of 100m$ currently sleeping.
Aavengers could use their platform of predilection to borrow their existing xSushi.
Support community-led projects.
Risk Mitigation:
Sushiswap has been audited 2 times and is a community-led project.
We currently have more than 23 000 Sushi guests.
We had one exploit leading to rewards not being rightly distributed to xSushi holders that was mitigated in 5h after being discovered with 15 000$ in lost profits reimbursed directly by treasury with no holders loosing any assets.
I will let the Risk team evaluate correctly but I believe we could be between a C+ to B-.

SUSHI has a good market capitalisation with a high volume. The price has suffered from extreme volatility since inception, suffering from large drops in value which is problematic for a collateral, requiring prudent parameters.

The forum is the hubspot for Aave decisions. At the moment, interactions feel impersonal, contributors are not always rewarded for their investment and there is no fundamental incentive to vote on proposals.
Solution


A first way to tackle this would be to introduce “Badges” into the governance forum.


Similar to a proof of attendance, badges are testimonials of different achievements into the Aave ecosystem.


Visually pleasant, those will gamify the participation to Aave protocol.


Maker successfully introduced Badges into their governance forum, months ago and Yearn offered PoA NFT to their early users.

An integration between Metamask and the Aave governance forum.


Astonishing badges for community members, with various criterias :



1 vote on Aave protocol
5 votes on Aave protocol
Participated to all Aave votes
Wallet has owned Lend once
Delegated his proposal power
Delegated his voting power
Delegated credit
Had collateral ratio inferior at 1.1 once

Others, open to discuss

Next steps :

I suggest this AIP to be a community made project - financed by the Aave treasury.

We will need 1 technical lead for this integration and 1 graphic designer/artist.


I propose the technical lead to define criterias of acceptance for this task and propose a reward in respect to the chargeload.


The designer could be Noah who recently joined the Aave genesis team or we could organize an open concourse.

But I further posit it would be best to increase >550 and at least match Celsius’ 7.5% so that users are not incentivized to withdraw funds to chase higher (and dare I say safer) yield with Celsius.

['ARC: Aavenomics quarterly upgrade'],"ARC rationale
On the 25th of September 2020, with the results of AIP-1, the Aave protocol kickstarted its initial phase of Aavenomics and Safety Incentives with a scheduled distribution of 400 AAVE per day to Safety module stakers.
With the implementation of the Aave Protocol V2 and the soft deadline of first-quarter approaching, the opportunity to upgrade the current Safety Incentives for a new quarter is here.
This ARC is inspired by the previous community-led discussions on the topic and the Aavenomics proposal with the objective to gather community sentiment and consensus to form and publish a formal AIP proposal vote for a community vote.
This ARC will increase the responsibility of AAVE stakers for their service of protecting the Aave protocol by the formal activation of the slashing.
The slashing officially enforces the currently implicit responsibility and risk of the participation in the stakings modules of Aave. In the worst-case scenario of critical failure, an amount to be decided will be slashed from stakers deposits.
In this phase 0 of the slashing, the auction mechanism will not be automatized yet and if a slash were to happen it would be done through governance and direct compensation.
This ARC will also enable Balancer Pool Token staking in the Safety Module.
To be discussed and decided :


Activation and reward for the Balancer Pool Token Staking (80/20 AAVE/ETH) : The BPT stakers will suffer a minimal impermanent loss due to the 80/20 ratio of the pool.
They will also receive BAL tokens as part of the balancer ecosystem liquidity mining.
They are also exposed to the same slashing risk as plain AAVE stakers.
Regarding the AAVE safety incentive for BPT staker, we propose to share on an equal basis, 50/50 with the plain AAVE stakers.


Increasing the Safety Incentives: As the possibility of slashing will now be formally introduced, staking reward should reflect the risk. Hence we propose to increase the Safety Incentives to 550 AAVE per day


Slashing %: The original proposal by the Aave genesis team was 30% of the stake. We propose to keep it that way but it’s still up for discussion.


In terms of timeframe, the AIP-1 plan was enabled on 25th Sep 2020 with a non-binding deadline of 90 days. If community discussions and subsequent AIP vote fail to reach consensus on 24th December 2020; the current safety incentives plan will continue until a new AIP is voted on, or the Ecosystem reserves run out of funds.
ARC content in short

Activation of the Slashing for the Safety Module with a maximum slashing threshold at 30% of Staked Amount
Activation of the Balancer Smart Pool 80/20 AAVE/ETH (BPT)
Increase the Safety Incentives for AAVE staking to 550 AAVE per day and start the Safety Incentives for BPT staking at 550 AAVE per day. The new total staking reward will be 1100 AAVE per day.

Assuming responsibility for adjusting risk parameters is essential for a safe, secure and efficient protocol. In-built depositor insurance is also an incredible new innovation in the space, and seeing it come to fruition is exciting!
I totally agree with the 50/50 reward split with plain stkAAVE stakers. Initially I had considered (and written a now-erased example) about whether or not we should reward staking on a value-denominated basis, but after consideration I believe allowing market forces to do their thing is a better option.
As for increasing the emission rate, I’m 100% on the same page. However, I do think we should look at this as a bootstrapping the safety module until governance eventually decides on long-term incentivization for stakers.
I would love to see the AAVE reserve eventually used for other purposes!
One point of contention is that there is only one option for providing insurance on Aave as of now, i.e: people cannot choose their risk/reward profiles. As time goes on, I’m looking forward to seeing and participating in discussions about risk tranching and separating risk between markets.

['ARC: Aavenomics quarterly upgrade'],"This post was part of the Delphi Daily released today, in which I introduced this ARC to our community of readers and shared my take on it.

Given that the main role of the SM within the Aave ecosystem is to serve as an insurance fund in case of a shortfall event, it is obvious why slashing is necessary; without it, the SM would serve no function. Thus, my comments will focus on the more nuanced second point of the ARC: introducing BPT to the SM. Concretely, I will argue why this ARC is a first step towards making the SM more robust and better suited to handle shortfall events.
Let’s first speculate on what a shortfall event could mean for the price of AAVE. As I see it, there could be three main drivers of price action given a platform deficit (the numbering doesn’t imply chronological order):


Price gets hit as trust in the platform is questioned. Selling within this group would be more long-term and fundamentals oriented from investors that get disenchanted with the brand.


Price declines as sellers try to front run selling from group 1, the upcoming liquidation event of the SM and potentially the minting (and selling) of new AAVE tokens if the SM can’t cover the whole deficit.


As price declines because of the previous points, a higher share of the SM needs to be liquidated to cover the losses of the shortfall event. This can even get to the point where the SM can’t cover the losses and additional minting and selling of AAVE tokens would be required.


The most dangerous aspect of the previous scenario is that a vicious cycle can emerge from the dynamic between points 2 and 3. As price declines as a product of points 1 and 2, a higher share of the SM needs to be liquidated, which in turn can exacerbate more selling from group 2, which would imply that an even higher share of the SM would need to be liquidated and so on (see next figure). The higher the share of AAVE held by the SM, the more powerful this dynamic can become.

Even though it is impossible to estimate what the precise effect on price a shortfall event could have on AAVE, we can look into the recent past for some hints. The next figure shows price evolution from different DeFi projects since they were hacked. Two important facts are worth noting from that graph: 1) Token prices have been aggressively hit (-18 to -53%) immediately following the hacks; and 2) Some tokens are able to recover over time. An additional point worth noting here is that none of these protocols had native token backed insurance funds (as the SM); as such, the price impact of a shortfall event on AAVE could be greater.

Figure 2. Soure: Data from Coingecko. Calculations my own.
Considering the above, a useful liquidation mechanism could be put in place whereas, given a shortfall event, the SM liquidation would happen gradually over a predetermined period of time. This would mitigate the reflexive dynamic pointed in Figure 1 and would also potentially allow AAVE price to recover before starting to liquidate the assets.
As was pointed before, the higher the share of AAVE within the SM, the more powerful the reflexive dynamic in Figure 1 becomes. In this sense, another mechanism that could help mitigate that dynamic is adding other assets to the SM (this is where the BPT introduction comes into play). The best assets suited for this purpose would be assets with low correlation to AAVE and low volatility. Low correlation with AAVE is needed because, as correlation rises, real diversification from adding a new asset declines. In other words, adding highly correlated assets to the SM would virtually just mean keeping it 100% in AAVE. On the other hand, low volatility is needed so that the value of the SM doesn’t aggressively change over time. Let’s explore how ETH, which is the second asset proposed to be part of the SM, behaves for these two metrics.
First, let’s consider ETH and AAVE correlation. The correlation coefficient between these two assets stands at 0.56, which implies low to moderate correlation. The following graph shows a plot of the logarithmic return correlation between these two assets.

Figure 3. Data from Coingecko. Calculations my own.
As was mentioned before, a good asset to be added to the SM should have low volatility. The following graph shows the 30-day volatility of ETH (red) versus AAVE (green). What’s clear from that graph is that ETH has experienced consistently lower volatility than AAVE for most of the examined period.
1600×589
Figure 4. 30-Day Volatility. ETH (red) and AAVE (green). Source: Coinmetrics.
Putting the above together, ETH is an asset that presents low-to-moderate correlation to AAVE and consistently lower volatility. Thus, I consider its addition to the SM a positive step towards making the SM more robust (and less reflexive). And I say a step because even with this addition the SM will still be highly exposed to the price of AAVE. The next table shows how the AAVE and ETH shares of the SM evolve as the share of the BPT in the SM increases. As can be seen, even at 100% BPT share of the SM, it’s still 80% AAVE overall.

Table 1. AAVE and ETH Share of SM vs. BPT Share of SM.
The 80/20 AAVE/ETH BPT design decision, however, was made taking other additional factors into consideration. One of those factors is protecting stakers from impermanent loss and allowing them to still be highly exposed to AAVE – that’s in part why the 80/20 decision was made. As the share of ETH in the BPT increases, stakers would be less exposed to AAVE and more exposed to impermanent loss.
If DeFi has taught me anything, it’s that every design decision comes with tradeoffs. In this case, the tradeoff of the 80/20 Balancer Pool is between diversification (as the share of ETH increases, diversification of the SM increases) and staker incentives (as the share of ETH increases, stakers are less exposed to AAVE and more exposed to impermanent loss). In this sense, I think the 80/20 design decision strikes a good balance between SM diversification and staker incentives.
Let me conclude by saying that this ARC (if passed) marks the beginning of the journey for Aave’s Safety Module. On one hand, it introduces slashing, which underpins the main functionality the SM serves. On the other hand, it introduces a BPT 80/20 AAVE/ETH as a new asset backing the SM – making it more robust and better suited to serve its purpose. As I’ve argued in this piece, I welcome these developments for the SM and look forward to the next evolutions of this critical piece of infrastructure within the Aave ecosystem.",90,888.0,2020-12-07
['ARC: Aavenomics quarterly upgrade'],"Looking forward to that update, @Dydymoon!
Just wanted to ask, what’s the motivation behind increasing the emission rate to 2000 AAVE/day?
Hey @JonathanErlich! Thanks for the interesting and in-depth analysis, however, I’d like to add my feedback!



 JonathanErlich:


Price gets hit as trust in the platform is questioned. Selling within this group would be more long-term and fundamentals oriented from investors that get disenchanted with the brand.



I actually fundamentally disagree with the premise of this statement. Should the safety module slashing event occur, I believe trust in the platform would rise. This implies that the in-built insurance system works! With that said, should the Aave platform itself have a smart contract failure, this is much more akin to your example.
It’s likely, though, that there would be selling from external AAVE holders in anticipation of the slashing sell-off. However, I believe that after the slashing event occurs, stability (or, at least, crypto stability)  will quickly claw its way back to the market. Slashing is a risk stakers, and to a lesser extent holders, knowingly take.
I believe the most likely scenario would be the failure of a given ERC20 asset, resulting in a lack of profitable liquidation opportunities for loans taken with this reserve as collateral. If slashing successfully covers the necessary loan amount, then this would undoubtedly greatly bolster trust in the Aave protocol, which would be healthy for the protocol.
Your vicious cycle is definitely interesting and worth thinking about. Perhaps this can be mitigated by gradual slashing as you mentioned, however, I personally need to put more thought into this. Complex stuff!
On your last point, adding other assets to the safety module should definitely be considered. BPTs are a great start. I might not be 100% opposed to allowing ETH as a security module asset in the future, either, but I need to give it more thought. This issue stems from the predicament we’re in where the most hardcore believers in the protocol, i.e: stakers, are the ones most at risk of losing their governance power.
On the other hand, there is a deeply beneficial alignment of incentives that occurs with stakers having to put said governance power on the line. Since their assets, and governance power, are at stake (pun DeFinitely intended), it’s a top priority for stakers to maintain appropriate risk parameters.
Lastly, it’s also important to keep in mind that, in the future, risk tranching might be a great alternative to manage staking risk. How this is done is up for debate, but I’m pretty excited to see what we as a community can come up with.
In closing, I want to ensure that the focus of the Aave protocol remains on long-term sustainability, security and growth. Short-term token prices willl react to short term events, but long-term prices will react to the quality of the protocol.
Love seeing more and more great input!",70,54.0,2020-12-07
['ARC: Aavenomics quarterly upgrade'],"A lot of great ideas here. I’ll chime in here with one: dynamic reward distribution.
TL;DR: CDS markets popping up (aka COVER) create a better proxy for the level of risk in protocols and that should be the benchmark for rewarding stakers on an ongoing basis (not static).
It feels somewhat suboptimal/arbitrary to split rewards 50-50 between stakers and LPs. Both are equally important but no amount of incentives will attract LPs if there is not sufficient security (or perception of it, at least). Rather than reward in equal parts, perhaps we can introduce a dynamic reward distribution system that ensures stakers get a minimum viable yield for backstopping the protocol in the event of losses. This prevailing yield on AAVE Claim Tokens on Cover + [potentially some premium] could be a good proxy for the implied level of risk taken by stakers.
In this dynamic rebalancing mechanism, the # of rewards (with a certain min and/or max) diverted to stakers are in flux to ensure they are being properly compensated for the level of risk they are taking on at any given point in time (vs. static under the current design). Any excess rewards are then distributed to LPs. The min-max range gives LPs some level of certainty on the expected yield.
Perhaps the main drawback of this dynamic reward mechanisms is that it introduces more uncertainty to LPs, which in an extreme scenario may get very little yield. That said, LPs don’t get any rewards today so I see this as being less controversial than not properly incentivizing stakers to secure the protocol. Said differently, an LP would be ok not getting a reward so long as the network is secure.
In theory, my hypothesis is that this design is more efficient than the current static distribution one, but I’m less sure of how to actually implement it (and if it’s practically possible without introducing too much complexity).
Open to ideas and thoughts.",67,78.4,2020-12-08
['ARC: Aavenomics quarterly upgrade'],"Hey Santiago,
Totally agree that an arbitrary reward split is suboptimal and that fees should instead be based on supply/demand dynamics. I like your idea about using COVER price as an oracle, but I think there are quite a few execution problems with this, not least of which that COVER is an unlevered system which, at least currently, results in high prices. We believe an interesting solution to this (which will also be incorporated into our next proposal) is breaking out insurance as a separate product on the demand side (i.e. offer insured and uninsured APYs to depositors) such that it’s possible to compute insurance demand / capacity separately from money market demand. This also opens up the possibility of making Aave’s insurance fund a distinct product in and of itself, insuring other protocols and projects.",65,33.0,2020-12-10
['ARC: Aavenomics quarterly upgrade'],I like this quite a lot.,68,13.6,2020-12-11
['ARC: Aavenomics quarterly upgrade'],"Hi all,
I’ve been thinking about the 50/50 split between StkAAAVE and BPT. In short I for one find it difficult to justify it.
Lets say that StkAAVE vs BPT staking proportions end up being 80/20 then it creates an unfair reward distribution for StkAAVE stakers, as they absorb most of the SM risk and only 50% of daily AAVE distribution. An inverse scenario would mean the same for BPT stakers.
Clearly these risks profiles are not the same in the full picture, however I do believe that when it comes to safeguarding the SM every staked token should benefit from rewards pro-rata. Thus, both BPT and StkAAVE  participants  should have access to one pool of rewards and receive them proportionally to the value of their stake.
Another noteworthy fact is that Balancer smart contract BPT risk is being fairly covered by the Balancer distribution as well as the trading fees.
I also agree with raising the total rewards to 1100 AAVE/day as the SM needs more staked volume, but not with the 50/50 split. Also the idea of having tranches of risks in the future is very interesting. For example there may be pools for those who are prepared to lose even 100% of their stake in an emergency for higher rewards of course. In that scenario the split would make sense. In the current one, it is unnecessary and potentially detrimental to either StkAAVE or BPT as we cannot ascertain whether their respective shares will end up being 50/50 of the total staked volume, nor is it imperative that they end up hovering along those lines long-term.",68,148.6,2020-12-15
['ARC: Aavenomics quarterly upgrade'],"Yes, I thought this myself. It could also occur that people staking Aave are not happy to take the possible 30% slashing risk for a 5-6% return per annum.

Could the 1100 be split between both pool, with a bigger weighting to whoever is providing the most liquidity to the safety module?",65,73.0,2020-12-15
['ARC: Aavenomics quarterly upgrade'],"Thank you for all the points you made. From what I understand about this project and your proposals, It makes sense to have that 80:20 mix.

['ARC : Listing due diligence with the Kleros T2CR'],"Following the expressed need of decentralized risk teams evaluating assets to be listed as collateral, here is an Aave Request for Comments (ARC) on a proposal to use the Token² Curated Registry as part of a due diligence process before listing new assets.
We propose to create two Aave badges (one for listing assets and another for listing them as collateral) on the Token² Curated Registry. This registry will validate that assets requesting a listing satisfy Aave risk criteria. Assets getting an Aave badge can be put to vote on Aave governance for listing.
Abstract
Listing assets on Aave and in particular assets as collateral is an important part of protocol governance:

Assets which can be borrowed on Aave. Those need to have smart contracts compatible with Aave and be of relative interest in order not to clutter the UI and use gas for nothing. They should also have enough liquidity to avoid huge price increases (drops are fine) in a short time period which would make some positions undercollateralized.
Assets which can also act as collateral. Those are particularly critical to Aave. In case of rapid price change of the asset, some loans could end up undercollateralized which would lead to staked AAVE being auctioned to reimburse outstanding protocol debt. Even worse, in case the asset is compromised (either due to a smart contract bug or a misbehavior of an actor managing the system), all the money in Aave could be stolen.

The Aave team used to handle the listing process and had set up a risk team to do due diligence on assets to be listed on the protocol. With the value in Aave increasing and the listing process being transferred to the decentralized governance system, additional due diligence tools are needed to keep the system at the highest safety standards.
We propose to create two Aave badges on the Token² Curated Registry as an additional due diligence tool for token listing. Anyone will be able request an Aave badge for an asset by putting a deposit. Anyone would be able to challenge an Aave badge explaining why the asset risks exceed the acceptable risks as defined by the Aave risk methodology. In this case a Kleros dispute would be created. Unchallenged assets and assets who won their disputes can be put to vote for listing on Aave governance.

['ARC: Add support for FARM (Harvest Finance) as collateral'],"Hello, —I’m Redmption, a Community Manager with Harvest Finance—
Today, I’d like to propose the addition of $FARM as collateral on Aave. FARM is a profit share and governance token for Harvest Finance, an automated yield farming platform, which has been delivering incredible value to DeFi farmers for 15 weeks, recently exceeding $590M in deposits and currently 2nd ranked in Assets on DeFi Pulse.
With an AUM now exceeding yEarn’s, we believe the addition of $FARM as collateral on Aave would sustain an attractive market. It would also enable additional strategies for FARM holders that could eventually be harnessed in a FARM vault that employs rehypothecation strategies like lending on Aave to generate yield.
Why FARM?


Profit Share - The $FARM token has actual value in receiving 30% of all profits generated by liquidity providers at Harvest Finance. By providing cash flow even in down markets at a P/E ratio of less than 3, users see Harvest Finance and $FARM as a haven against bear markets.


Harvest has the technical expertise to deploy a FARM vault that could harness Aave’s credit delegation to leverage staked FARM for additional yields.


Harvest is a community enhanced project, with multiple initiatives to fund the Ethereum ecosystem via grants, and through strategic partnerships with newly forming projects like Perp.fi and Benchmark. The FARM token is also utilized for voting on initiatives that impact the platform and community.


Aave users love Harvest Finance! Harvest Finance accepts single currency deposits such as DAI, USDC and wBTC. With such low rates offered by Aave, blockchain analytics show users leverage their assets at Aave for stable coins to deposit at Harvest Finance. Those users in turn gain $FARM rewards, which if approved as collateral could then be deposited back at Aave for leverage.


Harvest Finance is entering its 15th week of production, and each week has implemented changes that bring additional integrity and value to the platform such as a supply burn and emissions reduction, multiple security audits, implementation of the 12 hour strategy timelock, and being the first automated yield farm to deploy UNI and IDLE strategies. I believe a quality project such as Harvest Finance which combines quality development with deep community integration is an excellent candidate for the Aave platform.

['Increasing Aave partnerships and integrations?'],"(not governance related)
 on this morning’s announcement that Aave secured an EMI license. (link) Today is big day for all Aavengers.
My first thought when I read about the EMI license was this adds legitimacy to Aave that no other DeFi project has. I think this gives Aave an opportunity to have more mainstream integrations to offer yield generating opportunities, along the lines of what Paxos recently announced with Revolut and PayPal.
Before approaching these very mainstream/traditioinal partnerships like Revolut and PayPal, I believe that Aave still has a ton of room to grow with more crypto-focused partnerships. I lay out my thoughts below with context, suggestions, and some questions of how the community can help. Talking to other Aavengers, many of us are operators in crypto and well-connected and would like to be able to help however we can to grow the Aave ecosystem.
–
One thing I’ve been impressed/surprised about while watching the growth of Compound has been how many apps Compound is powering on the backend.
For example:


Dharma runs its interest generation via Compound


Donut runs its interest generation via Compound


Multis.co “business banking” runs its interest generation via Compound


Linen App runs its interest generation via Compound


Zerion.io “save” tab only offers Compound


I’ve also seen CeFi apps like Celsius use a similar go-to-market approach


Outlet Finance runs its interest generation via Celsius


Huobi Wallet runs its interest generation via Cred


etc., etc.,
In terms of making borrowing/lending available to institutional clients (i.e., people who require custody to use/hold assets) Compound is over-represented with mainstream providers as compared to Aave.

Coinbase Custody is considering support for LEND, but doesn’t support it yet
Anchorage supports COMP, but not LEND
Bitgo appears to support cTokens, but not aTokens
Curv currently partners with Compound to offer yield to clients
Fireblocks currently with Compound to offer clients an “Institutional Crypto Savings Account”

Are there any apps like this (i.e., apps with smooth UI that abstract away the crypto aspects) currently running solely on Aave? For example, I saw Enjin and walked through that experience, but that is very much a crypto wallet (not user friendly).
How can the community help? Some ideas:


Improve the developer docs / ease of integration for third parties.


Hire more full-time BD people who are experienced working with crypto companies (I’m open to helping😁)


If necessary, perhaps we could fund a grant project or incentivize projects such as Dharma or Donut to switch over to Aave?


Anecdotally, even just yesterday, I was talking to a medium-sized southeast Asian crypto exchange (that offers local fiat rails) and asked them what they thought about DeFi. They were preparing to integrate with Compound so their users could earn yield that way. I naturally suggested they check out Aave, but the guy I spoke to had never heard of Aave (truly, few understand this).
Thank you Stani and the rest of the Aave team. The growth of the protocol and market cap without many of the above things is VERY impressive and I do not at all want to denigrate that. I only want to help Aave reach its next phase of growth .

"['Proposal:Implement Optional and decentraliced securitie layers like 2FA, KYC or face recognition']","If we want to atract money from traditional banking I think securitie and trust from the noob users must be a priority. Adding more securitie features like 2FA, KYC… would atract more users from traditional banking, they will be more confortable using the platform if they know its imposible or very difficult to hack an account. A hacker can easily hack a private key from a noob user, enabling 2FA or 3FA options would be nice for the noob user. A optional  KYC, may be an option for disabling withdraws and token transfers until completing a secure KYC. Preventing any posible hack would make more atractive the platform.
A problem could be (for Aave stakers) that token can be transfered when its staked (stakedAave token), I dont like this system, I have too much money in stakeed aaves and Ive got some fear a hacker hacks my private key, I know how to store it securely but fear is fear…I would be more confortable if a hard KYC or 3FA its asked when I want to unstake my tokens.

"['Proposal:Implement Optional and decentraliced securitie layers like 2FA, KYC or face recognition']","You do realize that even if you perform KYC, so long as I have your private keys I can still move your money right? KYC doesn’t protect the user from this scenario. KYC does more harm than it does good. Example being, KYC typically requires photo identification, address and if you’re in the US you probably need an SSN. All of this information will be stored on a 3rd party centralized server, because I doubt AAVE would have the capability to implement KYC for the entire world. Knowing this, this is an attack vector as seen with the Ledger hack. KYC also alienates a large amount of potential users of the platform. Let’s say AAVE does implement KYC but they can only provide service to those in the UK, well you’ve just eliminated all of North America, South America, Asia, Africa and most of Europe.
The best security approach is to eliminate the idea of private keys in general. At least from the users perspective.

The wave of institutionals will likely coincide with more conservative markets, more developed on-chain insurance and potentially services specialized in bridging TradFi and DeFi. They will come.

I understand your point and where you are coming from…
But I think you are missing the bigger picture here.
Not having KYC makes the tech available to countless more people and that’s undeniable.
And if that is undeniable I rather not have KYC because I want more people to use this tech ; and people that don’t have banks too ; instead of bringing money from people on Tradfi, Wich will come anyway regardless of KYC in my opinion.
If you are aware of a great decentralized iD project that could work than let’s talk about it.
But no decentralized iD project will make anyone in Tradfi “confortable” it won’t change anything in my opinion at this early stage.
Honestly it amazes me that someone is in DEFI and and even thinking about KYC I think that is a huge problem honestly.
In time countries will create laws and legislate crypto and that will be your KYC but we don’t have to implement it ourselves.

['Proposal: Add support for BAL'],"Hi Aave community!
This is a joint proposal by @mubaris and @monet-supply to add BAL as a new asset in the Aave market.
Some details about BAL & Balancer
Balancer is a decentralized exchange that uses a constant function market maker formula to allow liquidity pools with multiple tokens, custom allocations and fees. Smart pools in Balancer can be used for programmable liquidity. Traders can swap between any of the tokens listed on Balancer in exchange for a swap fee (paid to liquidity providers) and slippage based upon the relative trade size. BAL is the governance token of the Balancer exchange, entitling holders (including those providing BAL liquidity on Balancer) to vote on proposals. BAL also receives preferential treatment in the Balancer exchange liquidity mining program.
At the time of writing, BAL has a market cap of $146M.

Available Liquidity
Most of the BAL liquidity is on Balancer itself. Balancer has a little over $80M liquidity distributed over multiple pools.
Apart from the BAL liquidity on Balancer, BAL is also listed on FTX, Coinbase, Binance, Gemini and other centralized exchanges.
Benefits for Aave

Balancer has a very active community which would bring more users and liquidity to Aave.
BAL earns native yield through liquidity mining on Balancer exchange, currently it’s possible to earn 80%+ APY with limited impermanent loss. This has generated strong borrowing demand for BAL on CREAM, with deposit rates often above 10%
With deposit rates so high, it becomes super cost effective for people to borrow funds with BAL as collateral. often their effective borrowing rate is negative!

['Proposal: Add support for Set Protocol Market including DPI'],"Proposal: Add Support for Set Protocol Markets
This is a proposal to add support for a new Set Protocol market that will enable the use of SetTokens as collateral and currency, expanding the surface area of markets that Aave is able to support - a key feature available with Aave 2.0. We imagine the first asset supported by the Set market to be the DeFi Pulse Index (DPI) and others to be subsequently added.
Set Protocol and Index Coop Summary
Set is an Ethereum-based protocol that enables the world’s on-chain asset managers to create and run asset management strategies. Live since April 2019, Set has created smart contract automated strategies (RoboSets), strategies run by 3rd parties (Social Trading), and is now spinning up organizations that run categories of strategies (Index Coop being the first).
SetTokens are ERC20 tokens that directly represent a basket of the underlying components, which are fully collateralized (assets held in 1:1 collateralization in a smart contract like Wrapped Ether). SetTokens can be issued by depositing the underlying collateral to mint a SetToken and can be redeemed by burning the SetToken and retrieving the underlying constituents. SetTokens can be rebalanced, where constituents and weights can be adjusted through trades on DEXes.
The DeFi Pulse Index is a SetToken that represents a basket of the top DeFi projects, a great addition to Aave as it has the following properties:

Significant Borrow Demand: There is significant desire from whales to lend out the DeFi Pulse index and to use the DPI as collateral to borrow stablecoins for farming, going leveraged long/short, and implementing structured products (e.g. carry trade).
Low Volatility: Because indices are a basket of tokens, they represent less volatility than the component assets by themselves
Efficient Sector Representation: Adding an index as collateral also gives exposure to all the component tokens while only having to add in a single token, thus saving gas in Aave’s system
Liquidity via Primary and Secondary Markets: Minting and redeeming represent the primary market of the indices, but many users can buy and sell indices on the secondary markets - mostly Uniswap. The price on the secondary markets are kept at Net Asset Value (the market value of all the underlying components) through a network of market makers that redeem the tokens when price is below NAV and vice versa.

Key Risks
The risks of Set Protocol are derived from the methodology described in the currency risk section as well as the following analysis.
Smart Contract Risk
Set’s V1 contracts have had upwards of $27M locked and have been live for 18 months. Set’s V2 contracts have had upwards of $22M locked and have been live for 3 months.
V1 Smart Contract Audits:


PeckShield Audit [January 8th, 2020]

Trail of Bits audit [April 8th, 2019]

ChainSecurity audit [February 18th, 2019]

V2 Smart Contract Audits:


OpenZeppelin [September 2020]

Counterparty Risk
DPI is the first index product released by Set Protocol and has been functioning securely since its launch in September. Anyone can permissionlessly issue the DPI token by depositing the underlying component tokens and can redeem the DPI token for the underlying components.
Only the Index Cooperative is able to make decisions regarding the index composition and the rebalancing process. Governance over the Index Cooperative is decentralized with the community making critical system decisions.
In the current version of V2, rebalances do not have any lockup times so that does not pose a risk.
Market Risk
DPI is backed by the component ERC20 assets leading to exposure to the market risks of the underlying tokens. Because DPI is a basket of tokens, the volatility of the DPI is significantly less than each individual token as seen in this graph below:
1022×669 91.1 KB
DPI is currently the 9th most liquid token with over $31M in liquidity in it’s Uniswap pool.
Set Market Risk Parameter Considerations
DPI price will be derived from the prices of the underlying components. Rebalancing happens once a month where weights and the underlying assets can change and as a result, oracles must be available for the assets that are added.
The liquidation process can happen in two ways. Liquidators need to liquidate on Aave and then either sell DPI on the Uniswap market or redeem the underlying assets and then sell them.
The Concourse team has an open source version of an arbitrage bot that mints and redeems automatically. It is possible to build a liquidation bot that does the mint/redeem and liquidate function on Aave in 1 transaction.
Proposed Interest Rate Model
We derived the variables of the interest rate model based on the rates DPI’s component assets have on the main Aave market. Slight adjustments were made to reflect the lower volatility of DPI due to it being a basket product and the Set market being a segregated market.

We’ve been at work behind the scenes getting all the technical requirements in order to launch this market (DPI oracle and market deploy scripts). As a follow up wanted to outline the proposed governance of the Set Market.
Voting and Control
The intention is for AAVE to always have a role in governance of the market, AAVE knows how the markets function better than anyone. To that end, and given that there is not another token to share control of the market with all governance decisions will be delegated to AAVE. If at some point in the future there is a Set token launched then perhaps the market can come under split control.
Fee Split
To start we’re proposing a 70/30 split, with AAVE receiving the majority share. Given that AAVE will have governance control and be in charge of maintaining the market from the outset we believe it’s important the community be compensated for their operational help. Set will attempt to push our partners to enable markets within the Set Market thus driving more revenue to the AAVE protocol. Additionally, it is likely Set or Set partners will build products that leverage AAVE’s lending and borrowing capabilities (i.e. leveraged or inverse Sets) to drive consistent revenue to the protocol.",26,50.2,2021-01-22

['Limitations of a Market for UNI-V2 Collateral Be Created?'],"Hey folks!
The migration’s going on right now, but I still wanted to get the discussion started in regards to implementing a Uniswap-V2 market on Aave. As of now, we can deposit our UNI-V1 tokens in their respective market.
Anyway, I was wondering if anyone more well-versed in the intricacies of Aave’s contract code and limitations could answer these two questions:


Does the implementation of different markets (like what was done with UNI-V1 and soon SETs) have a negative impact on the gas fees (as is the case with each additional added collateral) of all Aave markets?


Are there technical limitations in regards to the structure of the UNI-V2 tokens that could cause an issue with Aave integration; in other words, Is it possible?


Lastly, if this integration would be deemed more beneficial than detrimental, what do you guys think the consequences of implementing UNI-V2 tokens as collateral on Aave would be?

No negative effects as the markets are deployed on their own smart contracts, meaning that gas cost will not increase for other markets


Not any technical limitations that I would see at the moment, so Uniswap v2 market is possible :)


As it could be added as a separate market (as was done with Uniswap v1 money market) it does not add additional risk to the main or other markets. Also interesting note is that with stablecoin LP pairs there is actually less volatility and less market risk in that sense. Hence they are quite interesting assets as collateral.

['Limitations of a Market for UNI-V2 Collateral Be Created?'],"Uniswap V2 Risk Analysis
Uniswap is an automated liquidity protocol: a decentralised exchange based on open source smart contracts and a constant product formula. Uniswap V1 liquidity tokens were the first secondary market on Aave Protocol V1. Since Uniswap V2 has gathered most of the liquidity thanks to significant improvements including ERC pairs, improved oracle, optimised gas and flash swaps - more details can be found in the whitepaper. Uniswap V2 now holds $3 billion of liquidity reaching $1 billion of daily volume.
Users who provide liquidity to Uniswap pools get UniTokens representing a share of the liquidity. These tokens are derivatives of the underlying Ethereum/ERC20 pair. They are backed and instantly redeemable in the two underlying assets through the smart contract. Therefore, UniTokens hold the risk of this smart contract code and architecture as well as the risks of the underlying assets.
A technical smart contract review of Uniswap V2 LP tokens concluded that the code is really simple and does not carry any additional risk. Furthermore the contracts have been battle tested and market proven as shown by the historical data and usage review.
Liquidity providers are rewarded through commissions composed of 0.3% swap fees and spread which depends on the market conditions. The automated liquidity protocol is based on a constant product formula, which may result in impermanent loss, depending on the volatility of the pair as explained in the Uniswap documentation.
Anyone can contribute to an Uniswap liquidity pool, by depositing an equivalent value of the 2 assets forming the exchange pair. Similarly, anyone can also use the products offered to swap tokens.
UniTokens V2 on Aave would provide the potential to leverage the $ 3 billion of liquidity on Uniswap V2. These tokens have a risk profile close to their underlying assets with some specificities: the UniToken V2 contract, additional downside risk due to impermanent loss and upside with fee accrual. To avoid potential contagion, UniTokens need an independent secondary market initially not covered by the Safety Module with the possibility to propose cover. Given the more complex nature of these assets, they may only be used as collateral to borrow against stablecoins or top assets.
This initial assessment focuses on pairs already listed as collateral on Aave Market, with good liquidity and volume.

['Limitations of a Market for UNI-V2 Collateral Be Created?'],"Hi @razaraz
Each market has its own risk profile, depositors can therefore choose where to allocate their liquidity based on their risk appetite
In this initial review of the Uniswap V2 Market, the Risk Team looked at UniTokens as collateral similar to the Uniswap V1 Market. In this first review ETH is not a collateral with no need of liquidity for liquidation. Furthermore most UniTokens are ETH pairs, as such they are highly correlated to ETH leading to less volatility risk. There is reduced risk when borrowing against the same asset and ETH not a collateral resulted in optimised risks for ETH
In the Aave V2 Market ETH’s average deposit APY is just 0.24% since inception showing there is little demand to borrow ETH. ETH is mostly used as a collateral. It is therefore crucial to ensure there is ETH liquidity available in case of the need to liquidated, this is where the aggressive borrow model kicks in from the optimal utilisation ratio.
The analysis is now being extended to the borrowing of UniTokens. In this case ETH is also a collateral with the need to protect liquidity with a more aggressive interest rate model so updating to the same borrow model as in Aave V2 Market",10,7.0,2021-01-20
['Limitations of a Market for UNI-V2 Collateral Be Created?'],"I believe Aave have a potential to be a building block to compete with Alpha Homora’s current leveraged LP offering when LP tokens are accepted as collateral.
The ETH low utilization assumption may not hold in this case tho. If we look at Alpha Homora, we can see a much higher ETH utilization ratio (~80%) than Aave, this is due to high borrowing demand for liquidity provisioning for different pairs.",9,36.8,2021-01-26
['[Poll] A Pool that Automatically Re-Stakes AAVE'],"Hello Aave community!
Recently, there’s been a slight demand for a way to automatically re-stake earned AAVE without having to go through individual transactions. On that front, I’ve constructed a stkAAVE staking pool!
I’d like to get the community’s feedback and opinion about it in the poll below, but first, here’s a short summary of how it works:
The Staking Pool's Architecture
Say a user deposits AAVE into the pool...

The pool stakes the user’s AAVE and mints them ERC-20 compliant pool shares, representing the user’s ownership of the pool’s stkAAVE.
There is a re-staking function which in turn withdraws the entire pool’s pending AAVE rewards and deposits them back into the safety module, increasing each pool share’s underlying stkAAVE. A fee is levied here (more on this later).
Upon redemption, the pool returns the caller’s stkAAVE and burns their shares.

There is a special address called “manager” (better name pending…), this is the address the aforementioned fee is sent to, and it can…

Alter the fee amount
Call the restaking function
Transfer the “manager” address

Here’s what the “manager” CANNOT do:

Freeze/transfer/withdraw locked funds that it did not individually deposit (i.e. deposit like any other user)
“Add” fee types (i.e. the contract is designed with only restaking fees and cannot currently have withdrawal or any other sort of fee levied.)

Why Charge a Fee?
Eventually, I’ve got hopes that it’ll give me a little bit of income! But, first thing’s first, calling the re-staking function requires gas. The fee’s main purpose is to, well, help me cover that expense.
Although I haven’t built the script yet, I’m designing a bot that checks the fee amount it would earn against the gas it would have to spend to call the re-staking function every set interval. The bot would then only execute it if the earned fees would be greater than the gas spent.
Some Relevant Calculations
I’ve done a calculation, assuming a conservative 5.00% APR on staking AAVE without compounding (0.01369863013% daily without compounding).
With a 1.0% fee levied, your daily rate would become 0.01356164382%, and your annual rate would rise to 5.07% (assuming daily compounding, even if only compounded twice a year, the APY is 5.01%, which is higher than 5%!! A 2% fee remains profitable unless compounding is done less than once a month, too.)
Keep in mind, however, that these calculations are not necessarily exact. They assume perfect conditions and constant yield. Your return will vary according to the total stkAAVE in the safety module.
Now it’s finally time for that poll!
Should The Staking Pool Be Completed & Deployed to Mainnet?

Furthermore, if you’ve got time to write your thoughts about the fee structure, nothing is set in stone as of yet, I’d love as much input as possible.

The Aave Reserve currently consists of AAVE, however during v2 Reserve Factor collects part of the interest earned into the Aave Reserve. This would mean that the reserve would also include stablecoins that could be used to incentivise development.
Additionally the community should think of compiling a contribution guide which could include the process on how code developed by the community members could be contributed into the core protocol. The contribution guide should have step by step process and cover the security aspect, for example code review by the Aave team and audits.

['TUSD Ownership Change'],"Hey @Alex_BertoG - happy to share more. Yes we are still working on TUSD, but are no longer the ultimate owners of the product/business line- some info about the new owner (Techteryx) is below. Overall, it was clear to us that more resources would be required to grow TUSD to be at the scale of USDC or USDT, and we believe partnering with the Techteryx consortium will accomplish this.
Info about Techteryx the acquirer of TUSD:
The acquisition of TUSD is led by Techteryx, an Asia-based conglomerate with businesses in Hong Kong, Singapore, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Beijing etc. in the traditional real estate, entertainment, environmental, and information technology industries.
The conglomerate sees a significant unmet need for financial innovation in global amongst traditional sectors, and have identified cryptocurrencies and in particular, stablecoins, as a key part of the next generation of financial products and services that is capable of driving significant adoption.
For purposes of acquiring TUSD, they have created a joint venture led by Ms. Jennifer Jiang, the largest owner and a business executive with prior experience in the traditional financial industries in mainland China and Southeast Asia, including Singapore and Hong Kong. Ms. Jiang has previously led the acquisition of over a dozen companies, currently worth over US$3.0 billion and is deeply connected with traditional industries.
The private keys are managed in the same way as before, by the new TUSD management team with multisignature, a Gnosis SAFE (gnosis-safe.io) solution. All TUSD funds are held at fully licensed and regulated banks and trust companies in the United States and Hong Kong, including PrimeTrust (https://www.primetrust.com/), Silvergate Bank (https://www.silvergatebank.com/) and First Digital (https://1stdigital.com/ 1). All funds are held in FBO accounts for the benefit of TUSD token holders and cannot, under any circumstances, be withdrawn by its owners for any proprietary use. All minting and redemptions of TUSD will continue to be verified by these custodians and banks regulated by U.S. and Hong Kong regulators before any TUSD can be created or burnt.
Two key points:

The same TrustToken team will continue to be involved in running TUSD and for compliance and management of the underlying reserves
The underlying reserves will continue to be audited and attested to on a live basis by Armanino LLP, a top 25 accounting and audit firm based in the US (https://www.armaninollp.com/) who, in addition to live attestations of stablecoins, also provide “proof of reserves” audits for exchanges (Proof of Reserves | Armanino).

None of these core features of TUSD will change based on the new ownership.
Points of contact for the new TUSD team:

Engineering representative Terrance: terrance@trueusd.com

Marketing and business representative Annabel: annabel@trueusd.com


We do think overall the future for TUSD is now stronger than ever- we’re expecting more usage, liquidity, volume, borrowing, etc. in the coming months.
Let us know what other questions we can help answer.",17,468.4,2021-01-22

['Proposal: Add Support for Barnbridge BOND Token'],"I am Akin Sawyerr, I am part of the operations team at Barnbridge
We are proposing to add Barnbridge (BOND) as a collateral asset to the Aave protocol allowing investors to gain further exposure to risk tranched yield products.
Barnbridge will help bring more liquidity to AAVE
At the core of the Barnbridge thesis is the market need for diverse yield products. Two particular attributes we are focusing on are the ability to take fixed rate positions, and higher variable risk exposures from a single asset pool. We are taking an approach that’s tried and true in traditional financial markets called risk tranching.
Tranching risk allows investors to take targeted positions and exposure on yield producing assets. These financial assets are generally known as collateralized debt obligations, the most popular of which are mortgage backed securities.
Tranching is the process of subdivided a pool of assets into risk categories with different return profiles. Typically the more conservative and lower risk / lower return pools are called senior tranches and the more aggressive higher risk/ higher return pools are called junior tranches.
Group899.png1125×849
    Example of the tranched debt pool (for Illustration purposes only)

Barnbridge will be able to plug into AAVE to access variable yielding products from AAVE and other originators of debt products, we will then create pools of these debt yielding assets with similar attributes (terms, duration etc), and tranch them into higher risk and lower risk segments.
The end goal is to create derivatives that give liquidity providers a more diverse set of tradable products that meet their evolving needs. This should create more liquidity in the market for debt products and attract new capital into the defi space.
We’re looking forward to community feedback.

['ARC: Increase AAVE Liquidation Threshold'],"Proposal:
To increase the Liquidation Threshold for AAVE from 65% to 75%.
Summary:
After a comparison between LINK (75%) and AAVE (65%) liquidation thresholds it became clear to me that AAVE needs to be adjusted upwards given its price action in the last 30 days, based on a price dynamic comparison to the former asset (expressed in ETH since the LT and HF calculations are based on ETH as well).
AAVE: from 0.144 to 0.960 - 33.3% reduction
LINK: from 0.0223 to 0.0142 - 36.3% reduction
Overall AAVE enjoys great liquidity across ETH,BTC and Stablecoin pairs and there is no solid reason as to why it should not benefit from the same liquidation threshold as LINK.
A higher liquidation threshold will improve the Health Factor for AAVE holders that deposited AAVE as collateral and contribute to the protocol TVL, while keeping the LTV ratio the same will limit the borrowing risk that they are allowed to undertake just as before.
Let’s have the comments and polling going until the 11th of January 2021.
I am asking the AAVE Genesis Team or any team/individual possessing the technical capacity for an AIP implementation, to submit the AIP concerning this proposal on the week of the 11th, if judging by the comments and poll results the attitude towards the proposal is positive.

The last few months the market has been evolving fast and so have the risks so here is a risk update. Lets focus on $AAVE and $LINK:


In the last month, $AAVE’s market metrics have significantly improved with the daily volume now around $500m nearly matching the $560m of $AAVE on Aave. Liquidity Risk Score is B-
$LINK on the other hand has around $2b of daily volume largely able to handle liquidations of the $680m of $LINK on Aave. Liquidity Risk Score is B+
Historically $AAVE token has been subject to more volatility than $LINK, emphasized by the difference in market capitalisation. This seems to have shifted in the last month, with $LINK showing more volatility than $AAVE and both volatility risk ratings now at C. This change is very recent as last week $AAVE still had a volatility rating of C-.
You have correctly identified, significant improvements in $AAVE’s metrics this month, with risks reducing towards the levels of $LINK but not quite there yet. Increasing $AAVE’s LTV and Liquidation Threshold LT to the levels of $LINK seems a bit premature.

Summary:
Add DSD support to borrow and lend on AAVE
Dynamic Set Dollar:
DSD is arguably the fastest growing algorithmic stablecoin launched to date. DSD has a current market capatalization of $141.92 million & $38 million in “total” liquidity. The volume since inception (under two months) has exceeded $362,297,846.54 at the time of this writing.
The osculating design of the Dynamic Set Dollar protocol used to return it to the peg of $1.00 makes it an excellent candidate to be used as a colletral asset in all of decentralized finance.
Despite The DSD comminuity growing every day and millions being invested via options in the form of coupons; DSD is not a collateral asset on any defi money market protocols.
Précis:
DSD is a decentralized algorithmic self-stabilizing and censorship-resistant stablecoin without any collateral backing. Oracle-driven pricing for voluntary supply elasticity is used without having to trust third-parties. When valued over $1.00, the supply ramps up into expansion up to 10%. If the price falls bellow the peg of $1.00, mechanics incentivise Investors to burn supply.
The goal of DSD is to create a truly permissionless, scaleable, stable store of value, that can be used as collateral in various decentralized finance platforms.
Regulation: 12/31/2020
Total Liquidity: $38,687,432
Token Supply: 141,915,031.35
Coupons (Options): 80,780,000
Introspection:
With the explosion of growth in the DSD community, sheer trading volume & consecutive days/weeks trending on popular cryptocurrency websites such as dextools and coingecko, DSD would add significant TVL to AAVE. DSD would also bring additional users to the AAVE Platform.
Integrating DSD into AAVE would further legitimize DSD as an algorithmic stablecoin and store of value.

['Proposal: add support for ANT'],"Hi Aave fam,
I’m Jorge, a co-founder of Aragon and CEO at Aragon One, the company that has developed most of Aragon’s infrastructure to date.
I’d like to make a proposal for Aave to support ANT as a collateral asset. We think being able to lend and borrow ANT on Aave would open up several exciting opportunities for both Aragon and Aave.
Why aANT
ANT, the native token of the Aragon Network is already a well traded token with average daily trading volume in excess of $40m and tradable on most major exchanges including Binance, Huobi and OKEX.
A natural progression is to now create an ANT lending market and we can’t think of a better place to do that than with the Aave community. Being able to borrow and lend ANT would enable holders to:

Increase exposure to bonded ANT assets or other ANT based lockdrops
Create interest bearing aANT that can both be staked in other protocols (a necessity for an insurance product for DAOs we are currently researching) and loaned out to DAOs with unsecured loans via Credit Delegation (we have tons of ideas for uncollateralized DAO to DAO lending without legal agreements)
Increase voting power in the Aragon Network DAO to vote on important proposals
Engage in ANT farming
Create leveraged ANT trades leveraged derivatives

To kick off the ANT lending market on Aave, the Aragon Association and a number of other well known institutionals looking to put their ANT to work are ready to seed the lending market with over $10m worth of ANT.
Future Aave x Aragon collabs
Besides from developing an ANT lending market, there are other initiatives that we’re excited to develop with the Aave community. Over $350m worth of assets are currently secured by Aragon DAOs and we expect that number to surpass $1 billion by the end of 2020.
We’re interested in exploring a deeper integration with Aave that would enable Aragon DAOs to:

Deposit their entire vault of supported assets as collateral in Aave
DAO to DAO loans using Aave Credit Delegation
Convert specific assets in their vault into aTokens
On-ramp off-ramp to fiat (assuming this eventually be possible with Aave)

Other interesting things that Aragon could help Aave with are:


Implementing Optimistic Snapshot to make off-chain votes currently occurring on Snapshot binding on-chain with an Aragon DAO
DAO treasury management with conviction voting


Incredibly excited about everything that we can build together.

['Proposal: add support for ANT'],"Disclaimer: Delphi Digital holds both LEND and ANJ tokens
We are very much in favour of this proposal and excited to see both teams explore the design space for collaboration. We are working on a longer-term proposal for the Aave ecosystem which we believe aligns well with some of the future ideas, enabling Aave to become a credit protocol that allows ecosystems like Aragon to boostrap their own credit markets and backstop the risk themselves.
It’s worth remembering that Aragon’s AUM fluctuates between $200-400M depending on the day and the total value governed (combined market cap of protocols that use Aragon for its governance) is well above $3B. This is a lot of value that Aave can tap into. Similarly, there is a large amount of unused credit on Aave which could be used to fund DAO development.
Generally, we’re very excited about the long-term potential of Aave + Aragon enabling both collateralised and uncollateralised DAO to DAO lending. To begin with, most of this could be done with the current credit delegation feature, with reputational damage acting as the primary deterrent for non-payment. Eventually, I think you could have loan covenants defined using an Aragon Agreement, issued using Aave and enforced programatically and using the Court. Objective covenants could be enforced programatically whereas subjective covenants could be ruled upon by the court. For instance, think of something like an EU Development Fund type loan where the amount to be repaid depends on whether certain objective and subjective milestones are hit.
Ultimately, we see Agreements and Court as core primitives for advanced credit markets. With Aave being the leading credit platform, we see a lot of potential for a combination of Aragon and Aave enabling a much wider design space of potential loan products and enforcement options.",59,1876.8,2020-09-28

ANT is the governance token of the Aragon Network a smart contract system to manage unstoppable organizations on the blockchain in an efficient and decentralized manner. Aragon is now one of the most popular architecture for DAOs, with the system securing $350m of assets.
ANT Smart contract Risk: D
The ANT token started migrating to its V2 in October to enhance functionalities and reduce gas costs. Holders are slowly migrating which results in little battle testing of the token; yet ANT is a fork of uniswap liquidity shares which have been tested.
A technical smart contract review has identified a multisig retains control over minting - this is problematic for listing on the Aave Market covered by the Safety Module.
ANT Counterparty Risk: C-
Aragon Network is a permissionless DAO system where ANT holders vote on proposals. There are currently nearly 20,000 holders of ANT but only a minority has migrated to V2. Furthermore Aragon Network provides the decentralised infrastructure:

Aragon Govern which allows anyone to create their own DAO
Aragon Court a decentralised oracle solution.

The control over the minting retained by a multisig results in a low Trust.
ANT Market Risk: C +
The ANT token has experienced high volatility this summer but has since been less volatile than the rest of the market. The token is traded on the top exchanges and has good volume.

['Proposal: add support for ANT'],"Thanks for everyone for contributing into the discussion of this proposal. There are two interesting points I would like to highlight. First is that ANT has minter on multi-sig 0xbeefbeef03c7e5a1c29e0aa675f8e16aee0a5fad. The multi-sig consists of 9 keys and 6 keys are required to mint ANT, practically meaning that the token supply is in control of those keys. While having minting functionality brings flexibility especially in token economics there are some security considerations that needs to be taken into account mainly for the reason that listing ANT would mean that the asset can be used as a collateral and requires harder scrutiny upon listing.
The ways to solve the issue is to either set the minter to 0x0000 or to give the minting functionality to the governance. Since the multi-sig does allow up to 50 keys, it might be that 6 out of 9 keys is not sufficient to secure the supply of ANT and more community participants are required. This would help to reduce the risk profile of ANT when considering the listing which affects the risk parameters. I believe the team is looking for the latter option most likely.
More interesting consideration is that recently key members of the Aragon Association (AA) team has left AA including developer team members. While decentralized protocols run in autonomous fashion, first years of decentralized communities is spent on building a sustainable community that contributed into the innovation and development, and during those early years most of the innovation/management might rely on the founding team. While the events might not directly affect the asset itself it might affect other risk components of the assets such as liquidity and appreciation within the ecosystem.
By all means I think Aragon is fascinating project and the team has contributed very much into the DAO ecosystem over the years (and will continue to do so), as for what the events go I believe the situation is unique and should be of course openly discussed by the community.",15,3.0,2021-01-12
"['Discussion: USDC collateral type, backed by B.Protocol with 90% Liquidation Threshold']","Introduction
B.Protocol is a decentralized backstop protocol. We are live over MaekrDAO for one month, backstopping around $11m of ETH collateral and $4m of DAI debt. A first successful demonstration was done during the sharp market crash on the 26/11.
B.Protocol introduces the concept of relying on committed liquidators, who get priority in the liquidation process, in return to their commitment.
Currently we are an opt-in system, where users can decide to manage their accounts with us, and give priority to the liquidators. B.Protocol liquidators in return share some of their proceeds with the users who give them the priority.
In this write-up we propose to experiment a native integration between B.Protocol and the Aave, by on-boarding a new collateral type, namely USDC-B, which will be natively backed by a strong commitment from B.Protocol backstop.
A success of such an experiment could benefit Aave to give a better value proposition to the users, namely x10 long position on USDC, and could pave the way for more collaterals to be backed by B.Protocol with high leverage opportunities.
In the next Section we present a proposed set of parameters, then we propose a way to commit on liquidations, and finally we raise topics for further discussion.
Risk parameters

Loan To Value	88% (as opposed to 80% of USDC)
Liquidation Threshold 90% (as opposed to 85% of USDC)
Liquidation Bonus 5% (like USDC)
Reserve factor 10% (like USDC)
Maximum total supply - controlled by the DAO, initially $5m.

Committed Backstop design
For simplicity we describe a system with a single liquidator. Scaling the system for multiple liquidators, in a permissionless way, will be handled by B.Protocol, and it is not in the scope of this writeup (we presented some ideas on how to achieve fairness here).
Initialization: the liquidator opens an account with $0.5M USDC deposit, and 0 debt. We denote this liquidator’s account with la. Liquidator can withdraw collateral or increase his debt, only if his net position (collateral minus debt) is over $0.5M (according to Aave price feed).
Liquidation: when calling liquidationCall to an unsafe account a which has USDC collateral, then if a==la, or la does not have a net position of $0.5M, then a is subject to a standard liquidation process.
Otherwise, half the debt of a (denoted by d) and 1.05d worth of USDC collateral are shifted to la (using flashloan).
The liquidationCall function in this case is callable by anyone. And the callee will be incentives to call it.
Discussion
The expected course of events is that after a liquidation, the liquidator will take action to rebalance his new position, by repaying the new debt. In the long run, if he fails to do it, he risks being liquidated himself.
Given each user position is 110% over collateralized, an initial deposit of $X would in ideal situations be sufficient to backstop $10X of debt. Indeed, at a worst case an unsafe account has a
collateral of $5M of USDC collateral and $4.5m of dai debt. This position could be thrown at la making a safe account with $5.5m collateral, and $4.5m debt…
The proposed mechanism does not give mathematical certainty for the solvency of the system, however, insolvency would result in the liquidator losing his initial $0.5M deposit.
Over time the liquidator initial deposit might depreciate in value, and in this case his incentive to retop it is that in the meantime he will not be able to handle new liquidations. This mechanism design give rise to a more committed liquidator, which allows increasing the current USDC 85% liquidation threshold (where liquidators are not committed) to 90% liquidation threshold for USDC.
All the parameters presented here are very preliminary and subject to discussion. The development of bootstrapping of such protocol could be subsidized by B.Protocol, however it is important to generate a long term framework that will allow liquidators to profit. Hence, over time it might be needed to relax the capital requirements, or offer additional incentives to the backstop.
Operating within the framework of B.Protocol, who will integrate with additional lending platforms, will give rise to better capital efficiency for the liquidators, which could result in stronger commitment (i.e., capital) from their side.
Summary and open questions
The proposed collateral would benefit Aave users, as it will allow better leverage (which is currently not available at any existing DeFi platform). It is our belief that this will be obtained without additional risk to the Aave system, and moreover, it will actually increase its stability during sharp market movements.
The success of this experiment could lead the way to more higher leveraged assets, which could increase the total TVL in Aave, and help prevent future Black Thursday events.
This post is a call for discussion on:

$ANT is the native token of the Aragon Network. Aragon is the leading DAO infrastructure platform with 15/20 of the top 20 DAOs by treasury size being built on Aragon.

$ANT has a market cap of ~$140M, average daily volumes of $35M over the last 3 months, and is tradable on most major exchanges including Binance, Huobi and OKEX.  @Alex_BertoG has also previously conducted  an ANT risk assessment which can be found here
Why $ANT
We believe there are several reasons it makes sense to list $ANT on Aave:

$ANT is not currently listed on any other lending platforms and is not currently running any incentive campaigns. Aave would therefore be the only available alternative for $ANT holders looking to earn yield or lever their holdings.
$ANT is currently undergoing an “acquisition” of $ANJ which Delphi Digital has been strongly involved in. The Aragon Network has approved a conversion price of 0.044 ANT/ANJ for $ANJ holders willing to lock up their converted $ANT for 12 months. This is a >5x premium to the current market price. As such, we expect to see significant demand from users looking to hedge their $ANT exposure in order to take advantage of the higher conversion price. We are already seeing requests for this among our clients and expect this to generate significant borrow demand.
To kick off the $ANT lending market on Aave, the Aragon Association and a number of other well known institutionals looking to put their $ANT to work are ready to seed the lending market with over $10M worth of $ANT.

Being able to borrow and lend $ANT would enable a range of other applications:

Borrow ANT in order to finance acquisitions of complementary protocols (similar to the recent merger proposal of ANJ into ANT)
Increase exposure to bonded ANT assets

Future Aave x Aragon collabs
With over $350M worth of assets currently secured by Aragon DAOs, we believe there is significant scope for further collaboration between the Aragon and Aave communities.
We see the potential for a deeper integration with Aave that would enable Aragon DAOs to:

Deposit their entire vault of supported assets as collateral in Aave
DAO to DAO loans using Aave Credit Delegation
Convert specific assets in their vault into aTokens
On-ramp off-ramp to fiat (assuming this will eventually be possible via Aave’s e-money license)

HUSD
HUSD is a stablecoins launched by Stable Universal with a partnership with Paxos Trust. Before AAVE, HUSD has been supported by Curve, Tokenlon , Uniswap, Mooniswap (in liquidity mining program), dForce, ForTube. And other DeFi protocols are in the progress to support HUSD: Cream (voting is going on), MakerDAO (community green light)
 HUSD Smart contract  Risk: C+
The HUSD contract launched in July 2019 has a small number of transactions, just like BUSD most of the transactions are likely to happen off-chain on the centralized exchange like Huobi, FTX and HBTC.
Since the smart contract is so recent, HUSD is not suggested to be used as collateral at present time.
HUSD Counterparty Risk: B-
HUSD is centralized and backed by real USD, with the same custodian as BUSD, with a centralization risk factor at D+ and trust level at A. (same score as USDC and BUSD)
The administrative feature is, Stable Universal is the issuer and Paxos Trust is the custodian. A monthly audit attests to the consistency of the USD bank reserves versus the on-chain circulation supply of USD.
 HUSD Market  Risk: B-
The market capitalisation of HUSD has reached $280M now, which the 6th stablecoin in the world, larger than TUSD, sUSD.The trading volume for HUSD is around $22 million a day, mostly happened on Huobi and HBTC. (this volume is same as DAI when the assessment done on DAI )As a stablecoin backed by USD, the volatility is very low.
Result：
According to the AAVE risk assessment framework, the risk rate of HUSD is lower than BUSD and higher than sUSD.

I don’t think centralized stablecoin is an ultimate stablecoin solution, it does have some problems or issues. (You know even Bitcoin is not perfect, right? ) However, I think for the current stage centralized, assets backed stablecoin at least can be  relatively “stable”, and they do attracted fiat money users/traditional institutions to come closer to blockchain world. Since it’s most easy to understand , use and trust for most of the people around the world.
Rome is not built in one day, before we have the ultimate solution, we should think of alternatives. For now the most important thing is, in centralized stablecoins, whether HUSD is a better choice.

['Proposal: Add Support for Gemini GUSD'],"Hi Aave community!
I recently submitted an application to onboard Gemini’s GUSD stablecoin as a collateral asset to the MakerDAO protocol. I think that GUSD could also be a worthy addition to Aave.
Some details about GUSD:
GUSD is issued by Gemini Trust Company, LLC, a New York state based trust company. The fiat USD corresponding to issued GUSD is held by State Street Bank and Trust Company (NYSE:STT). Monthly accounting examinations are performed by BPM, LLP. GUSD was launched in September 2018 and for a time was one of the largest stablecoins with over $100M circulating at its peak. The circulating supply of GUSD has since declined as it was dwarfed by USDC, USDT and other stablecoins with wider trading and defi usage. The supply of GUSD is currently ~$10.5M, having grown from a trough of ~$4M at the end of 2019.

Accountant’s reports at bottom of page: https://gemini.com/dollar#reports
Trail of bits contract audit: https://gemini.com/static/dollar/gemini-dollar-trailofbits-audit.pdf
Liquidity:
GUSD can be exchanged for USD at a fixed 1:1 rate on the Gemini exchange. I have personally tested this out and was impressed with the results: withdraw of GUSD from Gemini exchange was sent within 1 minute using fast gas, and deposit back into Gemini was credited within ~17 block confirmation. It should be possible for liquidators (who are willing/able to KYC) to flip GUSD collateral directly through Gemini for the time being.  GUSD also has a few trading pairs on other centralized exchanges such as OKEx, HitBTC, and ZB. I plan on submitting a proposal to create a GUSD Curve pool in the near future as well, if this is supported by veCRV voters the on-chain liquidity for GUSD should improve substantially.
Benefits for Aave:

Diversification of centralized assets: GUSD relies on a different issuer and custodian compared to USDC, TUSD, USDT, or BUSD. Credit, custody, or regulatory risks may be less correlated across these assets, which could reduce risk to Aave security module stakers.
New DeFi on/off ramp: Gemini has good linkage with US bank wire and ACH networks, comparable to Coinbase as a fiat ramp.

While Coinbase have played nice so far, it’s dominance in regulated crypto liquidity and USDC on/off ramp has huge influence over the space. I see Gemini and GUSD as a viable competitor. From an industrial economics standpoint, Aave and other Defi protocols like Maker may benefit from breaking down monopolies of their key counter-parties.
++ onboarding proposals for Curve and Compound",126,4430.2,2020-08-27
['Proposal: Add Support for Gemini GUSD'],"From a personal perspective, I’m in total support.
While I may be bias as a Gemini user, when I think of the two top US exchanges (that are staying ahead, working with regulators, and institutions), I mostly think Coinbase & Gemini, however as you said, even though Coinbase has played nice so far it’s dominance in this space has a huge influence over things, especially with its growing USDC.
Because of that, it would be nice to see support for GUSD slowly kick off in some places, including Aave. Current support for GUSD outside of Gemini is virtually none in my experience.
As for the risk aspect or legal side, that’s a whole different world to me that I can’t comment on, but the benefits you mention are definitely notable as well.",109,96.8,2020-08-28

Gemini has a solid reputation and they’re currently one of leaders explaining DeFi to the traditional financial world (based out of NY, well established, well regulated, etc).
Giving Gemini more exposure within Aave is likely a win for all sides – but it should be noted this is a massive expansion opportunity for Gemini as GUSD has a significantly smaller market cap than other stablecoins on the platform. GUSD is also under-represented outside of the Gemini ecosystem – something that I’m sure they’re keen to expand.
For reference, here are the current stablecoins supported by Aave (by market size):

USDT: $13.4B
USDC: $1.5B
DAI: $450M
TUSD: $340M
BUSD: $190M
SUSD: $95M
GUSD: $11M

Liquidity provision:

Providing liquidity to Aave money markets
Aave money market integrations

['Proposal for a different and new Aave Money Market: The RSK Market'],"We propose to incorporate The RSK Market.
This work will completely be done by RSK devs. We will only ask Aave to be close to the RSK team to incorporate their experience. RSK already has done an integration with Chainlink, and we use the TokenBride to link both blockchains using LINK to pay Chainlink´s Node Operators.
We will intensively work first on testnet, and once quality/security is done, will move it to production. This could be done in a short period of time.
Now that Aave aTokens can be exported, as an example of things that could be done, we can use this tool and have customers on each blockchain doing business on both sides, something that never was done before.
             *An Aave approach to the Bitcoin world.*

What is RSK?

RSK’s full technology stack is built on top of bitcoin: From RSK smart contracts to the RSK Infrastructure Framework. The stack is designed to create a more fair and inclusive financial system.
Bitcoin, is a store and transfer of value. The blockchain is secure because miners with high infrastructure and energy costs create the new blocks to be added to the blockchain every 10 minutes. The more hashing power they provide, the more secure the network is.
RSK is the first open source smart contract platform that is powered by the bitcoin network. RSK’s goal is to add value and functionality to the bitcoin ecosystem by enabling smart-contracts, near instant payments, and higher-scalability.
How RSK is connected to bitcoin?
The first point of contact is through mining.
The bitcoin miners do what is known as merged mining, securing both networks with the same infrastructure and energy consumption.
They create blocks on the bitcoin network every 10 minutes, including transfer of bitcoin from different addresses and in the process they create new bitcoins.
On RSK, blocks are created every 30 seconds, to secure the execution of smart contracts. This does not mint any new coins in the process, but does earn a reward from the merged mining.
2-way peg with Bitcoin
The second point of contact is the 2-way peg, also known as the bridge.
This component connects both networks to allow the transfer of bitcoins to RSK, thereby allowing developers to interact with smart contracts. They pay gas using the same bitcoin, the smart bitcoin.
RSK Market
We propose a new idea, which is to create a Market that incorporates new customers that are not using Aave. We will bring to the table new customers that will bring new business and liquidity from the bitcoin world that look the DeFi platforms differently.
Risks
This new Market will not bring or add new risks to the platform, but anyway we will keep security on top of priority.
New cryptocurrencies
We will bring together with our proposal, all new tokens that are already on RSK Marketplace natively that will increase the liquidity and opportunities for both companies.
Conclusion
Our business proposal is simple and synergic, nothing to loose, a lot to gain. We ask you Aave Governance community to give us a Go and allow us to show you what we could do.

But remember, assuming you are now on Aave, you may move some of your aTokens to RSK and once there, access to a complete different world, by interacting with bitcoin and other crypto based on BTC, and of course will work both ways.

['Proposal: New Aave Token Architecture'],"Aave community,
At Delphi, we’ve been working closely with the Aave team over the past few months in order to help guide the Aavenomics design, oversee the transition to Aave 2.0 and participate in community governance. As part of this, we’ve been hard at work designing a new Aave token architecture which we believe will enable greater capital efficiency, innovation, and robustness.
You can read the full 32 page proposal here, but we’ve also included a shortened version below. The full report is more comprehensive, includes a lot of helpful diagrams as well as an example model to help illustrate our design in action, so we recommend you check that out instead.
We look forward to receiving feedback from the Aave community on this and iterating together towards the best solution.
Introduction
Aave has become a leading crypto credit platform, with $1.4B in deposits. Impressively, it has both achieved and maintained this without deploying liquidity mining incentives, meaning Aave depositors are loyal users that have chosen to stay despite the more attractive yields offered elsewhere. This is a testament to the quality of Aave’s product and community.
However, we ultimately see lending becoming a “balance sheet as a service” business. This is an extremely competitive market since anyone that has a balance sheet can effectively facilitate lending, as we can see by large tech companies such as Uber, Amazon, Google and many others recently making moves to begin offering financial services. Within the crypto space, upstarts such as CREAM have achieved traction by adding taking on more risk while larger projects such as Yearn and others have also made moves to enter the lending space with a “stablecredit” solution.
While large lending pools such as Aave command some network effects in terms of the superior interest rates they can offer, their current design with a single, undifferentiated capital pool also comes with drawbacks:


Capital inefficient by bundling different risks together and offering a blended return, appealing to a narrower capital base


Hampers innovation by increasing the potential costs of failed experiments as these can cause contagion and systemic risk.


Act as a target for nimble competitors who can either introduce incentives to facilitate vampire attacks and/or take more risks in moving quicker to add new, riskier products


Our goal with this proposal is to continue moving Aave towards being a credit protocol rather than a credit facility. We want Aave to be the go-to platform for launching, growing and managing money markets, taking advantage of Aave’s existing community, liquidity, and scale.
In this way, our goal is to create incentives that enable permissionless innovation to happen on Aave rather than via forks or competitors. With this, we also want to ensure the potential risks from this innovation are siloed off from the rest of the protocol to prevent contagion and systemic risk while allowing innovators greater ownership and potential upside.
Thus, innovators and their early backers are able to reap the majority of the rewards from their innovations, but they must also ultimately bear the risk of its failure. This should also lead to more efficient allocation of capital as Aave holders can select from a broader base of yield opportunities within the ecosystem depending on their particular risk appetites.
At the same time, we must balance this with ensuring these innovators both benefit from and contribute to Aave’s network effects and scale. Crucially, the system must be designed such that innovators cannot exploit Aave by leveraging it initially and later forking away from it, as this would be detrimental to the broader ecosystem.
Most importantly, this design should lead to a better product for users, as Aave is able to add new products faster while keeping the UX simple and ensuring the risks introduced by these new products are insured by those capturing the upside. This effectively enables Aave to leverage its existing liquidity to offer a bundled insurance and credit platform for users; a value proposition that few competitors can match.
Methodology
This proposal will focus on outlining the high-level token architecture and principles we propose could be used to achieve the previously mentioned goals of enabling permissionless innovation, siloed risk and network effects for Aave as an insured credit protocol.
We have purposefully omitted specifics around lower-level details and system parameters in an effort to ensure that initial discussions remain focussed on overall architecture rather than precise numbers. While a model is included, this should be seen as a way to help illustrate the concepts discussed rather than representing anything final or definite.
Provided the community likes the general direction of our proposal and we can come to agreement on the principles of the broader architecture, the Delphi team will set to work on fleshing out some of the important lower-level details. As a next step, we will construct a full model to allow for simulation of different scenarios, releasing this to the community for feedback. Provided this is agreed, the final step is to work on an implementation plan outlining the best way to initially launch this new system.
System Specification
High-Level Description
At a high-level, we eliminate the idea of a system-wide safety pool and replace it with sharded safety pools in the form of aDAOs that underwrite specific, pre-defined risks. Rather than Aave being one set of money markets governed by all Aave holders, Aave becomes an ecosystem with many different sets of money markets being governed by groups of incentivised $AAVE holders.
For comparison, this is a diagram of how Aave currently works:
1600×751 46.3 KB
This is a diagram of our new proposed system:
1600×930 84.4 KB
As we can see, rather than a single pool of Aave holders governing all Aave markets and a single safety pool backstopping all Aave markets as in the first diagram, we now have segregated capital pools (represented by “aDAO 1” and “aDAO 2”) governing and backstopping the risk for their own money markets (represented by “aDAO 1 Money Markets” and “aDAO 2 Money Markets”).
Similarly, rather than fees being paid to all Aave holders, each aDAO earns its own fees based on the performance of the money markets it operates. aDAO token holders (i.e. Aave holders who stake to a specific aDAO) are entitled to 80% of the fees generated by that aDAO. Aave holders who stake to the ecosystem reserve receive 20% of the fees earned by each aDAO as payment for providing the infrastructure, governing the system, and bootstrapping initial liquidity.
Note: These are preliminary numbers included for illustrative purposes and liable to change based on feedback and/or further research. It is even possible that rather than a fee share, Aave instead captures value via $aDAO token ownership instead.
Crucially, while the aDAOs govern and backstop risk for their own money-markets, the user interacts with the Aave front-end and smart contracts. Thus, although aDAO holders have certain predefined rights and obligations towards the money markets they govern, Aave itself controls the smart contracts and consequently the user relationship and deposits.
Overview
Lenders and borrowers have access to a wide range of products on Aave. In the background, these products are operated by different aDAOs which are themselves governed and backstopped by subsets of incentivised Aave holders. Aave holders can therefore deploy capital to a variety of opportunities within the Aave ecosystem, making decisions based on their specific risk-reward profiles. To realize this goal, we propose the following structure:


$AAVE holders can either:


Stake $AAVE into the ecosystem reserve, receiving $stkAAVE entitling them to govern the reserve and earn fees generated by it


Stake $AAVE into one or many aDAOs, receiving $aDAO tokens


If an $AAVE holder stakes $AAVE into aDAO1 he or she is locked up for a period of time and receives $aDAO1 tokens issued on a bonding curve with $AAVE as the reserve asset. Use of the bonding curve has many benefits, including liquidity and encouraging efficient pricing of aDAO risk


The exchange rate of $AAVE to $aDAO tokens depends on the bonding curve of that aDAO


The $aDAO1 holder now has governance power within aDAO1, including:


Determining key parameters described later on in this document


Determining how to allocate the $AAVE in their capital pool, including the safety pool (which must be put into safe investments such as Balancer pools) as well as $AAVE in the treasury


The $AAVE in an aDAO’s safety pool will be auctioned off to make depositors whole in the event of undercollateralized or delinquent loans. This is described in more detail later on in the document


$aDAO1 tokens can also be staked on other platforms, but while the $aDAO1 tokens are staked the holder cannot engage in governance


The $AAVE tokens are a backstop to the tokens that are lent within the aDAO (the tokens available on each aDAO are determined by the aDAO (ex. ETH, USDC, DAI etc.)


$AAVE is the reserve token for the Aave ecosystem, backing up all $aDAO tokens. In addition, it has ultimate governance rights over all aDAOs and over the ecosystem reserve, which will itself include $aDAO tokens


Ecosystem Stakeholders
The Ecosystem Stakeholders are the following:
● $stkAAVE Holder: Stakes their $AAVE, receiving $stkAAVE entitling holder to govern the ecosystem reserve, which receives 20% of the collective aDAO earnings and may own assets such as $aDAO tokens.
● $aDAO1 Holder: Earns 80% of the lending origination fees from aDAO1 as well as benefiting from potential price appreciation in $aDAO1. Backstops risk in aDAO 1
● $aDAO2 Holder: Earns 80% of the lending origination fees from aDAO2 as well as benefiting from potential price appreciation in $aDAO2. Backstops risk in aDAO 2
● aDAO1 lender: Lends from money-markets governed and backstopped aDAO1
● aDAO1 borrower: Borrows from money-markets governed and backstopped by aDAO1
● a aDAO2 lender: Lends from money-markets governed and backstopped by aDAO2
● aDAO2 borrower: Borrows from money-markets governed and backstopped by aDAO2
Benefits
This design has several benefits:


Capital Efficiency: Tranching risk increases capital efficiency, allowing $AAVE holders to have access to different yield opportunities based on their risk-reward profiles. Holders who want the least risk can stake to the ecosystem reserve which doesn’t backstop any risk, users who want low risk can stake to one of the aDAOs that underwrites high-quality assets such as stablecoins/BTC/ETH, and users who want higher risk can take idiosyncratic risk on more speculative or higher risk aDAOs.


Faster Innovation: This design enables Aave to move even faster than it already does. Rather than the global safety pool in which any new product introduces the potential of contagion and systemic risk, the tranched model ensures risks are siloed and contained among those who are both willing to bear them and appropriately rewarded for doing so. This means Aave can launch higher-risk, more experimental products while providing higher safety assurances to users and eliminating systemic risk.


Better Products: This results in a better product for users who not only have access to a broader variety of products but also have the comfort of bundled in insurance via the bonding curve capital pool. This capitalizes on Aave’s liquidity and security network effects, making it very difficult for smaller competitors to be able to match Aave’s product offering.


Open Platform: The ability for anyone to create aDAOs that manage money markets transforms Aave from a credit facility managed by a central entity to a credit platform/protocol in which anyone can permissionlessly spin up money markets. Would-be competitors who see a product gap in the market are encouraged to create aDAOs rather than compete directly, taking advantage of Aave’s existing liquidity and customer base to enable a better product and faster route to market.


Forming an aDAO
In order to form a aDAO, an Aave staker submits an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) which specifies the aDAO’s charter and key system parameters. We outline a full list of potential parameters along with descriptions of each one in our longer form proposal linked above.
After formation, any changes to the aDAO parameters are determined by $aDAO holders with the result being submitted to Aave for execution. Any change to a fundamental system parameter means those on the winning side are locked for a predefined time period while losers can exit the system.
Rather than voting for/against it, the AIP must instead attract a minimum quorum of Aave staked to it (e.g. 5%). Upon reaching this minimum quorum, the aDAO is automatically created, with staked Aave being converted into aDAO tokens on the proposed bonding curve and locked for some period of time (e.g. 3 months). Initially, we would recommend AAVE either set an extremely high quorum for creating new aDAOs, operate all new aDAOs itself, or at least retain some level of veto power in order to ensure the quality and legitimacy of aDAOs being created.
aDAO Bonding Curve, Treasury and Balance Sheet
Bonding Curve Design
We suggest $aDAO tokens are issued on a bonding curve with $AAVE as the reserve asset. For simplicity, we’ve assumed a linear bonding curve shape and that all aDAOs utilise the same bonding curve shape.

We recognize that a linear bonding curve is not the optimal design for various reasons. Determining the optimal bonding curve shape is beyond the scope of this paper and will be part of the workstream in phase 2 once the architecture has been agreed upon.
Capital Pool as Insurance
Similarly to Nexus Mutual, the capital in the bonding curve acts as the safety pool that insures aDAO’s money markets against both smart contract and economic risk. In case of delinquent loans or hack, $AAVE in the bonding curve is sold to make depositors whole, reducing $aDAO’s token price. This means Aave can now offer a bundled insurance & credit product to users, increasing its value and fee extraction potential.
The treasury is a separate pool of discretionary capital that $aDAO holders have governance rights over. This capital is not in the safety pool or bonding curve and can be used by the aDAO for ecosystem incentives, yield-generating activities, paid out to $aDAO holders or anything else as determined by governors.
The minimum safety parameter (which is also set by the aDAO governors) determines the mandatory ratio of capital in the bonding curve to system capacity. As the aDAO grows and $aDAO token supply expands, overall system capacity grows alongside it as there is more $AAVE backing the curve. This means, provided the risk is appropriately computed and reflected in the MSP, users will always have access to insured money markets as $aDAO supply should grow alongside system capacity. For $aDAO holders, this also means not all capital in the Bonding Curve will be liquid/withdrawable at a given moment in time since part of it will be a liability in the form of money market insurance for depositors. However, $aDAO holders always have a claim to the $AAVE in the safety pool. If they want to redeem, they will ultimately have to wind down the money markets in order to eliminate the insurance liability.
aDAO Balance sheet - Treasury and Capital Pool
In addition to capital in the bonding curve / safety pool, aDAOs may also build up treasuries which are governed by $aDAO holders. There are multiple ways to for an aDAO to build up a treasury:


Divert a percentage of $aDAO token purchases to the treasury


Divert a percentage of fees generated to the treasury


Charge a withdrawal fee for bonding curve withdrawals and divert a percentage of this fee to the treasury


Implement a low maximum safety parameter, meaning capital flowing into the bonding curve gets diverted to the treasury early on


Receive a grant from the Aave ecosystem reserve


1600×985 58.4 KB
The aDAO balance sheet can thus be seen as follows:
1400×1180 27.5 KB
An aDAO token’s book value is the excess capital in the safety pool above and beyond the amount necessary to satisfy the insurance liability (determined by System Capacity * MSP) plus the amount in the treasury.
image698×278 14.6 KB
As such, the bonding curve price can be rightly seen as the $aDAO’s token’s price floor, with the market price most likely trading above this. This is because the bonding curve price doesn’t take into account the additional $AAVE in treasury which $aDAO holders have rights to (aDAO equity in the balance sheet above).
Ecosystem Reserve and aDAOs
Governance
Ecosystem Governance
At a high-level, $AAVE holders who stake to the ecosystem reserve receive $stkAAVE which entitles them to govern the reserve and receive some yield from that. This should require a lock-up period and be the lowest yield available in the Aave ecosystem since $stkAAVE holders are not backstopping any risk. As mentioned previously, the ecosystem reserve should primarily be used to bootstrap the Aave ecosystem by investing and providing grants to aDAOs, although working capital can also be invested as determined by the governors.
In case of a hack, $stkAAVE holders may choose to use the ecosystem reserve to make depositors in an aDAO or aDAO holders themselves whole. However, it is not obliged to do so as each DAO is fully self-sovereign and liable for its own risks.
aDAO Governance
aDAOs are self-sovereign entities governed by $aDAO holders with a one-token-one-vote system. In order to govern the aDAO, only $aDAO tokens held for at least 7 days are able to vote on any proposal. We propose that voting power scales logarithmically with time tokens are locked for, rewarding longer-term holders with more governance power without leading to excessive concentration. To supplement this, we suggest a reputation system which is specified in more detail in our longer-form proposal.
We propose that any vote that alters a fundamental system parameter (i.e. one of the charter parameters outlined in the “Forming an aDAO"" section) locks the winning side’s tokens for an additional 7 days after the vote finishes, with the losing side being unlocked immediately. This ensures that users are able to exit the system if the aDAO no longer operates by the charter they agreed to, with those proposing the change living with the consequences of their decisions.
While the aDAO is self-sovereign, it does not itself control the smart contracts of its money-market. Instead, any decision made by the aDAO is sent to the Aave DAO to ratify and execute. This ensures TVL always sits with Aave, maximising the ecosystem-wide network effects.
1600×879 47.5 KB
AAVE and aDAO Interactions
As a metaphor, the Aave ecosystem reserve can be seen as the holding company while aDAOs are the partially owned subsidiaries. The ecosystem reserve will hold $AAVE tokens and may also hold several $aDAO tokens. In addition, it receives cashflows from all underlying aDAOs, with $stkAAVE holders being in charge of allocating these cashflows to wherever they can achieve the highest returns.
The ecosystem reserve can interact with the aDAOs in a variety of other ways. These are specified in more depth in the “AAVE and aDAO Interactions” and “Ecosystem reserve and aDAO” sections of our longer form proposal.
Protecting from tail risk
While the system works well under normal circumstances, given that all aDAO safety pools/bonding curves are held in $AAVE, a sharp fall in $AAVE price could lead aDAOs to trade under the minimum safety parameter. While this isn’t ideal, it isn’t as bad as it sounds since unlike something like THORChain, there is no immediate way for this to be exploited by bad actors. Rather, it simply means the aDAO is not appropriately collateralised for the technical and market risks it is exposed to.
It’s also worth understanding that there are natural market forces that should help collateralise the safety pool. Assuming the price of $aDAO tokens have intrinsic value based on the discount future value of cashflows they generate and distinct from the $AAVE price, then as $AAVE drops in price, users are able to acquire the same amount of $aDAO tokens at a lower dollar price. This should encourage more $AAVE to flow into the safety pool to take advantage of this.
Nevertheless, crypto markets are rarely efficient and we thus propose a few additional layers of protection for the system:


aDAO Treasury: The first layer of defense for an aDAO is its treasury. We propose that if the amount of value in the safety pool drops below the minimum safety parameter, the treasury is automatically transferred into the bonding curve/safety pool.


Incentive pendulum: If after transferring the treasury into the safety pool, it still remains undercollateralized, then we propose the following incentive mechanisms:


Increase Staking Incentives: $aDAO pools issue $aDAO credit tokens, entitling users who come in to stake while the pool is undercollateralized to receive a larger amount of future $aDAO tokens


Reduce System Capacity: If neither solutions work, then we suggest creating incentives to reduce system capacity, perhaps by implementing an increased fee on outstanding loans to incentivize users to pay their loans back.


Implementation
Types of aDAOs
At a high-level, we believe aDAOs should be segregated by their risk-reward profile, perhaps based on Aave’s existing asset risk framework. This allows each DAO to be owned and operated by stakeholders with appropriate risk appetites. In addition to tranching risk, Aave can also use new aDAOs to enable risk siloed experimentation hubs such as the recently proposed DAO to DAO lending.
We suggest, at least initially, each aDAO should have an exclusive license over assets deposited into its protocol as well as the type of lending products it provides. Eventually, we believe it should be possible to open this up, allowing aDAOs to offer similar assets, competing on the way the particular combinations of assets they provide, the speed/quality of governance and/or the risk-reward provided.
Initial aDAOs
Initially, we propose all initial aDAOs will be operated by Aave itself, with the current money markets protocol being split into either one or multiple aDAOs, pending feedback from the community:


Single aDAO


“Aave Classic”: includes all existing money markets


Two aDAOs


Aave AA: includes the highest quality collateral ($BTC, $ETH, stablecoins), having a lower safety parameter and consequently lower yield


Aave AB: includes lower quality collateral ($YFI, $BAT, $ENJ, $REN, $KYBER, $LINK, $MANA, $MKR, $REP, $SNX, $WBTC, $ZRX)


Three aDAOs:


Aave asset-backed: includes asset-backed tokens such as stablecoins, WBTC and potentially others such as PAXG.


Aave AA: includes the highest quality collateral ($BTC, $ETH, $LEND)


Aave AB: including lower quality collateral ($YFI, $BAT, $ENJ, $REN, $KYBER, $LINK, $MANA, $MKR, $REP, $SNX, $WBTC, $ZRX)


Initial $aDAO Distribution
The initial aDAOs will likely be comprised of Aave’s existing money-markets. As such, the initial $aDAO token launch will have to use some fair distribution mechanism to avoid users rushing to frontrun the aDAO bonding curve on launch. We have some ideas around how to do this that we will flesh out at a later stage.
Potential aDAOs
In terms of new aDAOs, there are many potential ideas here. Broadly, the goal should be either to either group together assets with similar risk-reward profiles or allow for experimentation with new kinds of products.
In addition to the aDAOs already mentioned above, these are some other potential ideas for aDAOs:
Risk-tranched


Aave asset-backed: Money markets for asset-backed tokens such as stablecoins, $PAXG, $WBTC, $REALT tokens, etc. In addition to traditional risk parameters such as liquidity, volatility, etc, risk framework should include custody risk, technical risk, and others.


Aave yTokens: Money markets for yield-bearing tokens including $YUSD, $YETH, $crUSD, $pUNIUSDC, etc


Aave BBB: CREAM competitor operating money markets for the long-tail of more illiquid, volatile tokens such as $UNI, $wNXM, etc.


Experiments


Aave uncollateralised: Money markets for uncollateralised stablecoin lending. This could have more stringent KYC requirements, operate using open law agreements and/or experiment with on-chain credit history, reputation or prediction markets.


Aave DAO2DAO: Money markets for DAO to DAO lending. This could be bootstrapped by Aragon and leading Aragon DAOs.


Risk Framework
Given the fact that aDAOs will be segmented primarily by the risk-reward they provide, combined with the importance of setting an accurate safety parameter for each aDAO to ensure system integrity, it’s extremely important to have robust risk frameworks to assess the risk being taken on by each aDAO.
These can be based on the existing Aave risk asset framework, but we also recommend this is supplemented with specific frameworks for different kinds of assets such as asset-backed tokens which may require bespoke analysis around things like custody risk. We also recommend standards are created to classify the riskiness of different assets in order to be able to accurately group them into the correct risk bucket and corresponding aDAO, as well as to be able to estimate what an appropriate safety parameter looks like.
The goal should be to first settle on a metric that accurately reflects system capacity, i.e. the risk weighted credit exposure that a certain aDAO is taking on. Then, each aDAO will define its safety parameter in relation to that metric, based on its charter and targeted risk-reward ratio.
User Experience
While the aDAO system may seem complex, we believe the majority of this complexity can be abstracted away from users. Provided all aDAOs are appropriately collateralised (which should be guaranteed by the governance process), users don’t care how the money markets are secured and governed, they just care about the variety, quality, and safety of the products they use.
As such, we propose all aDAO money market smart contracts are owned and operated by Aave and displayed on the app.aave.com website, similarly to how any new market would be displayed. Users interact with the money markets as normal and need not be aware of what aDAO is governing those particular markets.

['Proposal: New Aave Token Architecture'],"Alright! Love the idea. Risk pooling is a significant issue Aave is facing, and with the advent of V2, starting the discussion with something this powerful and innovative is great to see.
With that said, after reading the full proposal, I’ve got some concerns and questions. Let’s get into it! 

Safety Module:


As the protocol expands and more markets are created, the yield increases on the stkAAVE pool, causing an outflow from various aDAO security modules to balance the risk and yield. Does this not reduce the effective value proposition of the Safety Module by reducing the amount of insurance on each aDAO?


Liquidity Thinning:


As it stands, Aave governance is incentivized to focus on coming up with effective and efficient risk parameters for tokens.
Under the proposed model, the creation of new markets with aDAOs is encouraged, wouldn’t this result in a thinning of available liquidity as more markets are built? I.e. With each additional market with a given token, liquidity for that token could potentially be drained from previous markets until a risk/yield equilibrium is found.
Expanding on the previous point, as the creation of new markets becomes incentivized over the addition of new assets to existing markets, would it not become more difficult to unlock liquidity in a given token?
I.e. If a user has a token that is available on market B, but wants to borrow a token only available on market A, this is not possible without incurring the same liquidity thinning problem outlined in the question above.

Furthermore, if the liquidity thinning issue is assumed to be true, is it not in the best interest of current aDAO holders to fight against new market additions, which could reduce their liquidity/fees? On the flip side, is it not in the best interest of stkAAVE stakers to push for many new markets, with less regard for risk? For instance:
i.	aDAO1 has significant DAI liquidity, thus, adding the proposed aDAO2 could cause an outflow of DAI to aDAO2.
ii.	Though this would potentially raise the interest rate, it would also decrease total potential borrows/flash loans, and have an adverse effect on fees earned by aDAO1.
iii.	aDAO1 is therefore vehemently fighting againt aDAO2 to maintain its liquidity and fees.
iv.	The stkAAVE stakers are much more accepting of new aDAOs, since their risk is limited to negative price action incurred from aDAO stake slashing, rather than having their own stake slashed. Furthermore, their total earned fees should theoretically only rise, as their earnings are spread among all aDAOs.


Fee distribution:


Would having each aDAO as a semi-independent authority collecting its attributed fees result in a reduced ability to concentrate capital in a single, powerful reserve- instead opting for numerous, smaller and less impactful treasuries? If so, wouldn’t this reduce the Aave DAO’s capacity to invest in meaningful growth/talent/etc?


Bonding curve:


I fail to see the need for a bonding curve system- would the earned yield not suffice for pricing risk adequately without an added abstraction layer of speculation?
Expanding on the previous question, under the bonding curve system, stakers could potentially withdraw less AAVE than they put in without a trigger of the safety module should the aDAO token fall in price. Does this not result in added, speculative risk for stakers, who are already bearing the risk of being insurance providers?


aDAO Governance:


Since aDAOs form their own independent markets, how exactly do they benefit from Aave’s liquidity as stated in the proposal? It appears to me that they only rely on Aave to execute proposals. If this is true, what is the incentive to build an aDAO, losing potential fees and governance power to the ecosystem reserve without gaining in liquidity?
By segregating the AAVE supply into various aDAOs, are we not reducing the protocol community’s ability to come together for large, sweeping changes across the entire codebase, should the need arise?


Reputation & Voting:


An interesting idea, but is the same goal of encouraging participation not achieved by simply using a normal voter delegation system?
I somewhat agree with a winning vote lockup, but locking tokens with the FDS system is something I don’t really agree with. I see no reason to enforce this, bar potentially fighting against loaned governance token attacks which even then, could be potentially solved with the winning lockup, or just a general voting short-term lockup. I think the downside of locking liquidity is greater than the benefit.
Take this with a grain of salt but, if the DAO awards reputation, couldn’t larger players potentially sway the system in their favor?

I believe it’s fundamentally better to prioritize security and innovation, and though this proposal is aimed at the same goal, I feel as though it’s more of a way to circumvent security in favor of rapid innovation to prevent vampire attacks and maintain market share. I am more in favor of wise risk parameters with more assets in less markets, but with concentrated power and aligned incentives for the entire DAO.
Lastly, take everything I wrote with a grain of salt! The folks at Delphi Digital are waaay more experienced than I am. I’d just like to voice my concerns.
On that note, this was a bit of a brain dump so, if any of these questions/concerns don’t make any sense or if I misunderstood points about the proposal, let me know!
Cheers!

Capital Efficiency: Tranching risk increases capital efficiency, allowing $AAVE holders to have access to different yield opportunities based on their risk-reward profiles.


This is important in my opinion, profiles.

This means Aave can launch higher-risk, more experimental products while providing higher safety assurances to users and eliminating systemic risk.

Lends from


shouldn’t this be “lends to”?",77,65.4,2020-11-12
['Proposal: New Aave Token Architecture'],"This is an excellent proposal and am fully supportive of the high level design.
I had a few questions which would be helpful to clarify:
-The current stkAAVE yield isn’t very high at present, and where this design splits total yield across multiple segments as well as the ecosystem reserve, what mechanism is in place to ensure the yield is constantly adjusting to ensure the necessary supply of staking at each aDAO is met? For example, if there is close to zero participation for the lowest risk/ yield ecosystem reserve, is there any dynamic adjusting incentive to remedy this?
-Splitting the aDAOs for different assets makes perfect sense, but what if there is competition between the DAOs for an asset which is not clearly high or low risk?

['Proposal: New Aave Token Architecture'],"This is a very promising design, aiming to solve major areas of vulnerability whilst capitalising on Aave’s considerable lead and opportunity. It brings together a number of patterns that fit well in other projects (bonding curves, incentive pendulum), and introduces a new one that I believe will dominate going forward – the core/subcomponent or “franchise” model.
I’ve spent some time going through the past couple of days and will still take time to fully grok it. But I’ve got some initial thoughts:

The franchise model does feel natural to me, but I’m curious if you considered any other designs?
I am in an aDAO and want to remove my funds, but this would pull capacity below MSR. Presumably I’m blocked from removing my funds?
Could the bonding curve accept assets other than $AAVE? This could increase adoption by decreasing required exposure to a foreign asset. Global governance to whitelist accepted collateral – e.g. $ETH and $DAI (if you’re into that).

The principle is – should someone using a protocol really need to take on financial exposure to that protocol? The question might be, are the users of a pool the same as the creators? My suspicion is that in many cases, they are.


A broader point I want to raise in the Aave community is around external asset ownership. To your point about making Aave more of a protocol I feel that some pool parameters should be open to voting purely by holders of the pool’s assets, and should not require any $AAVE to be held. Could be a change further down the line, but I think this change paves the way well by reducing contagion risk.
Did you consider adding some measure of demand to the bonding curve? Currently the aDAO token has a deterministic price floor but I sense there’s an opportunity to bring more determinism as a function of demand. Potentially by taking trailing average fees, or fee levels as a direct input?

On that point, and I might’ve missed this, but how are pool fees set? At the risk of looking like a hammer, I sense it might be possible to pull this from the bonding curve.
Ironically I suspect that the more that can be deterministically factored in, the better it is for the Aave economy. More determinism → easier to trust → more $AAVE investment → more secure, better prices → more $AAVE investment etc. I think determinism could be a key input to Aave’s (and other protocols’) flywheel and therefore a key vector of defensibility.


In the case of a tail risk event, you propose an incentive pendulum. How does this work from a governance perspective? Is the functionality in place for pools by default, and enacted in via vote? Or could there be some more automated mechanism? e.g. reward flow as function of ratio of AUM to MSP.
You propose making it such that new pools are created and updated via AIP. My feeling is that for Aave to truly be an autonomous protocol, the aim should be for pool management to be entirely permissionless. This can be seen as an optimisation and introduced later, but I wonder if you think there’s scope for achieving that in this implementation, out of the gate? Or perhaps you feel that total software-mediation here is not desirable at all? If so, would be curious to hear why.
Do you have any plans to make introductory content to this proposal available? It’s extremely dense and I think some other formats could help it spread through the community and get to resolution more quickly. (I’ve made a brief attempt on Twitter .) Maybe a couple of videos – 1x high-level, 1x detailed – and jumping on the Delphi podcast would help?

I’ll be spending more time thinking about the problems and solution you laid out, but after an initial period of consideration this feels like a solid direction forward for Aave. This proposal gives me even more confidence that Aave can sustain its advantage as the leading provider of decentralised lending.",70,89.0,2020-11-16
['Proposal: New Aave Token Architecture'],"Hey @Zer0dot, glad you like the idea and really appreciate the thoughtful questions. Will take them in turn.
1. Safety module

As the protocol expands, the cashflows accruing to the ecosystem reserve increase. However, these necessarily increase slower than the cashflows to the specific aDAOs, particularly the higher growth ones since the ER receives less cashflows (20% vs 80%) and has a much higher numerator. Also, this doesn’t necessarily mean higher yield for $stkAAVE holders as we don’t believe all cashflows should automatically be paid out to holders but rather be used to build up a reserve / invest into new initiatives as per this proposal. The yield to $stkAAVE holders should always be the lowest available in the ecosystem because $stkAAVE holders aren’t backstopping any risk. Capital which wants higher returns will flow to the aDAOs based on their risk policies and mandates.

2. Liquidity Thinning
I’m not sure if you’re referring to liquidity thinning for the specific money market deposit tokens or for the $aDAO tokens so I’ll address both.
In the case of money market tokens, the proposal doesn’t actually fragment liquidity in money market tokens since each aDAO is granted an exclusive license over assets deposited into its protocol as well as the type of lending products it provides. The aDAO is kept in check by the fact that Aave can revoke its license if it feels like it’s not doing a good job. We are still on the fence about whether eventually different aDAOs can compete on the same assets, but right now we’re leaning towards thinking that the tradeoff in terms of fragmenting liquidity is not worth the added benefit of encouraging more competition to keep aDAOs in check. Especially since every aDAO will face both external competition as well as the possibility of Aave revoking the aDAO’s license, both of which should act to encourage performance.
In the case of $aDAO tokens, the idea is that aDAOs have their own differentiated mandates and resultant risk-return profiles. An aDAO isn’t limited to the tokens/products it initially launches with but will rather seek to continuously add tokens/products that fit with its mandate in order to keep growing.
I don’t see “liquidity thinning” being an issue because a new aDAO should only be launched if there is a ‘gap in the market’ in that no other aDAOs are adequately fulfilling its mandate. While some liquidity may flow from old aDAOs to new aDAOs, this should be a net positive for the ecosystem since it will increase capital efficiency by opening up a greater variety of risk-return opportunities for $AAVE holders and for investors who want exposure to the decentralised credit space.
On the other hand, I think there may be some fighting around which aDAO has “jurisdiction” over a certain asset, especially over time as assets which are initially risky and belong in a given aDAO may become less risky over time such that they belong in another aDAO’s mandate. Relatedly More research needs to be done on this but any decision of this sort should ultimately be decided on by $AAVE holders for the good of the broader Aave ecosystem.
3. Fee Distribution
At a high-level, Aave DAO would no longer be operating money markets but rather governing the aDAOs who themselves operate money-markets. As such, it makes sense that the aDAOs themselves build up treasuries since they will be closest to understanding the needs of their own money-markets. The alternative is extreme inefficiency and bureaucracy with each aDAO spending decision needing to be a proposal approved by $AAVE holders who are not best positioned to understand that aDAO’s needs.
It’s also worth noting that the Aave DAO should still be able to build up a significant capital base via fee flows from the various aDAOs as well as its ownership of $aDAO tokens. In any case, we really need to model this and tinker with it to see what it actually looks like. These parameters aren’t set in stone and are subject to being changed based on the modelling work to be conducted in Phase 2.
4. Bonding Curve
The bonding curve is necessary to incentivise boostrapping of higher-risk, early stage aDAOs by appropriately rewarding early believers. Otherwise, there’s no advantage to taking the risk early since later entrants can simply wait and pay the same price to stake in later once risk is lower / fees are higher. While a bonding curve isn’t the only way to do this, there needs to be some equivalent of a pricing mechanism to incentivise early adopters. For instance, while Nexus Mutual doesn’t use a bonding curve for staking on smart contracts, there is a functionally equivalent price curve which rewards early stakers:

$aDAO tokenholders are definitely taking a risk, but this unavoidable in other to create incentives for price discovery as mentioned above.
5. aDAO Governance
As context, there is a minimum quorum for proposed aDAO votes (we suggested 5%) and, provided the vote passes, $AAVE holders that vote for an aDAO will automatically be converted to $aDAO tokens. There are thus several benefits to launching an aDAO vs launching a competitor:

Access to Aave’s existing tokenholder base and associated liquidity. This initial capital base allows an aDAO to launch with insured money-markets from the get-go, providing a better product for users.
Access to a knowledgable, long-term oriented community to help govern and grow the aDAO from the beginning
Access to Aave’s existing integrations, brand and traffic as all aDAO money-markets are listed on Aave.com’s front-end

As a metaphor, an $aDAO can be seen as an Aave franchisee responsible for certain markets/mandates. They benefit from Aave’s brand, infrastructure and know-how, giving away some of the upside in return. The tradeoffs of starting an aDAO vs a competitor are similar in character to the tradeoffs of starting your own burger joint vs buying a McDonalds franchise. In the digital world however, network effects mean the benefits Aave can offer are much greater.
**6. Reputation & Voting **
I would argue some of the same results are achieved, with the difference being a voter delegation system still assumes all tokenholders are involved enough in the governance process to know who it makes sense to delegate their vote to (kind of like the traditional political system). A reputation system, because it starts off centralized, puts most of the onus of initial distribution on the DAO’s team and is more likely to trickle through and end up in the hands of valuable community members.
I’m not sure if I understand your point regarding locking tokens with the FDS system. The idea of Future Days Staked is that it’s a voluntary commitment a tokenholder can make to lock his tokens for X amount of time in order to augment his voting power proportionately. Ultimately, it serves to provide greater influence to less wealthy but long-term convicted $AAVE holders than to more wealthy speculators, rewarding commitment as well as capital.
Reputation is subject to being gamed just as all systems are. The key is to create strong norms around distribution and what constitutes a valuable non-monetary contribution.  Regardless, reputation is not the focus of the proposal and will be a later workstream once we’ve agreed on the high-level architecture of the system.
Conclusion
To address your last point, we don’t see this proposal as a way to circumvent security in favor or rapid innovation, but more as a way to enable secure innovation; reducing the potential downside of failed innovation and thus enabling more of it to occur. In all startups, it’s important to shorten the evolutionary cycle as much as possible, making small experiments, iterating and failing quickly in order to progress. This has arguably been Aave’s greatest strength so far and our fear with the concentrated power/capital model is that over time Aave’s size and the potential for contagion will impact its ability to do this.
Overall, really appreciate your contribution @zer0dot . You asked some excellent questions and this is exactly the kind of feedback we need to force us to think deeply and strengthen all aspects of the design.  Hope the answers were alright and please feel free to follow up with any more comments, questions or feedback. We’ll make sure we get back to you asap!",69,78.8,2020-11-16
['Proposal: New Aave Token Architecture'],"Thanks for this proposal, it is really great work 
I see many advantages in this architecture. Aave needs to evolve to continue embrace rapide pace innovations of DeFi and current structure does not allow to properly scale money market.
Sillos organisation seems to me like decentralizing the risk of each money market which is great. It empowers users and rewards at a better granularity their participation in the protocols market. At their risk.
Bonding curve :
As mentioned by @Zer0dot in his 4/ I also do not like the fact that rescue found liquidity providers will bear price fluctuations and insurance providing risk. A different design in the bonding curve could fix this.
I suggest a logarithmic curve for $aDAO exchanges. It will drastically reduce the risk of price fluctuation after reaching large amounts of founds while maintaining extra avantage for early comers.

Initial aDAOS
The Two aDAOs model is ok to me. It gives more choice to users and I assume we do not all expect to bear risk for $BTC as much as $YFI.
aDAO creation
The “stake to create” design seems nice. 5% quorum is nonetheless too much in my opinion. I would suggest 2 or 4% depending of community opinion.

Something interesting in this proposal is the fact that AAVE treasury will be dedicate to builders that will makes us closer to the ghost superstructure of DeFi we want to be.
Rewarding stkAAVE for their risk is not the most efficient utilisation of AAVE funds and your proposal also reasons to me after the recent talks regarding AAVE treasury management discussions.
This proposal should be known by most of community stakeholders because of all the changes it implicates. I can’t argue more with @oaksprout on the need to make it more accessible with different levels of details.",65,98.0,2020-11-16
['Proposal: New Aave Token Architecture'],"Hey @jose_delphi!
Thanks for taking the time to reply with a fantastic and well thought-out response. However, I’d like to continue the conversation. Let me preface this by saying that I may not be understanding everything here up to your (& the folks at Delphi Digital’s) level.
I’m just a regular participant, looking to understand the intricacies of your proposal and the long-term implications of such a system. Alright, with that said, here are more questions!



 jose_delphi:

However, these necessarily increase slower than the cashflows to the specific aDAOs, particularly the higher growth ones since the ER receives less cashflows (20% vs 80%) and has a much higher numerator.


Correct me if I’m wrong, but imagine Aave has 10 hypothetical aDAOs and each is earning the same exact amount of fees in total (bear with me here…). Let’s dub that amount “N.”
So, in a scenario like this, each aDAO staking module would earn 0.8N in fees, whereas the ecosystem reserve would earn 10 * 0.2 * N = 2N in fees.
Although this doesn’t mean the yield will be greater, it does mean that with each additional aDAO, the yield will momentarily increase, hypothetically causing an influx of AAVE capital from aDAO security modules to the ecosystem reserve in order to balance out the risk/yield ratios.
Assuming this is all true (tell me if it isn’t!), wouldn’t this outflow cause sell/redemption pressure on aDAO tokens, resulting in a situation where active aDAOs are incentivized to fight against any new aDAOs in order to prevent their token from facing inevitable downward price pressure?
Expanding on that, the yield would increase in that particular safety module as liquidity flows back into the nearly risk-less ecosystem reserve. Which, under normal circumstances would be a welcome improvement to current stakers! However, since the staked AAVE their aDAO tokens are entitled to is variable with regards to the bonding curve aDAO token price, they may lose out on value despite the yield increase. Am I understanding this right?
More on this later when I talk about the bonding curve again…



 jose_delphi:

In the case of money market tokens, the proposal doesn’t actually fragment liquidity in money market tokens since each aDAO is granted an exclusive license over assets deposited into its protocol as well as the type of lending products it provides.


Under this system, the only place stablecoins would be able to be borrowed would be the main Aave market- I disagree with giving aDAOs exclusive licenses over assets at all, because I believe it causes a significant reduction in utility. Even right now, the Uni-V1 liquidity token market has access to stablecoins in their own market.
In the current system, common assets/currencies (especially stablecoins) are going to be split between different markets… And this is a-okay since it isn’t a zero-sum situation; nobody really loses out. (Bar maybe people that need an unreasonably huge flash loan on very rare occasions…)
Implementing aDAOs would require, as far as I understand, either the implied reduction in utility caused by granting asset-exclusivity, or, if assets are allowed in any aDAO, a reduction in fees earned, and likely downward sell pressure on other, already implemented aDAOs.
I think I explained that pretty badly, let me try giving an example:
Picture a situation where two traders want to borrow DAI. One would like to use their RealT tokenized mortgage note as collateral, and the other wants to use YFI.
If both of those assets are in different markets, (as they likely should be), under the current system, I think this works fine.
In an aDAO system with asset-exclusivity, only the YFI borrower would have access to DAI since DAI is an asset exclusive to one market, in this case assumed to be the main Aave market. This is a reduction in utility.
In an aDAO system without asset-exclusivity, this works fine for both users- the problem lies in the aDAO token pricing. Jump back in time for a second and picture a staker in the main Aave aDAO, before the real-world asset money market aDAO was implemented…
Because of the bonding curve mechanism, the staker knows that they would lose yield AND Aave-denominated aDAO token value should the real-world money market aDAO come to fruition, since it would cause an outflow of common currencies (in this example, DAI) to the other aDAO. This would cause a reduction in yield, which in turn would cause an outflow of AAVE from that security module- the staker risks not only earning less yield, but losing some of the AAVE they originally deposited. Does that make sense?
I hope that sort of clears up my concern. Let me know if it doesn’t!



 jose_delphi:

The bonding curve is necessary to incentivise boostrapping of higher-risk, early stage aDAOs by appropriately rewarding early believers. Otherwise, there’s no advantage to taking the risk early since later entrants can simply wait and pay the same price to stake in later once risk is lower / fees are higher.


This is interesting because in the proposal, a new aDAO would require a minimum threshold of AAVE pre-staked in order to come into existence. Doesn’t that bootstrap safety module liquidity?
Furthermore, wouldn’t early staking be rewarded by a higher yield as more fees are distributed to less staked AAVE? On top of that, if I understand correctly; the idea is to reward early believers in the aDAO through positive price pressure as more AAVE gets staked, and thus aDAO tokens bought, right?
If that’s the case, isn’t this a double-edged sword because it inherently means you’re punishing later stakers?
E.g: If an early staker decides to sell his aDAO tokens for more AAVE than he originally staked (due to the increase in total staked AAVE), he’s profiting from other participants in the aDAO. I don’t think this is especially healthy or necessary.
I can’t help but think that having pure AAVE staked, without an intermediary bonding curve aDAO token, would remove both complexity and risk from the system. Although that’s just from what I understand.
I’m definitely not against implementing a system that requires an initial stake to bootstrap new market insurance, and letting the market’s yield balance out the staked AAVE in its given security module from there, if that makes sense.



 jose_delphi:

As a metaphor, an $aDAO can be seen as an Aave franchisee responsible for certain markets/mandates. They benefit from Aave’s brand, infrastructure and know-how, giving away some of the upside in return. The tradeoffs of starting an aDAO vs a competitor are similar in character to the tradeoffs of starting your own burger joint vs buying a McDonalds franchise. In the digital world however, network effects mean the benefits Aave can offer are much greater.


Interesting point here, I definitely get it now! However, since Aave (and DeFi in general) are open-source, I’m worried about the impact being under the “brand” will really have, when anyone can deploy the same, exact and verifiable systems without having to go through losing n% (in the proposal, 20%) of fees.
In fact, they might even be able to reduce fees compared to the regular protocol while maintaining higher effective %fees going to their safety module. This, in my eyes, would potentially pose a threat. Liquidity chases secure yield, and borrowers chase low fees, after all!



 jose_delphi:

I would argue some of the same results are achieved, with the difference being a voter delegation system still assumes all tokenholders are involved enough in the governance process to know who it makes sense to delegate their vote to (kind of like the traditional political system). A reputation system, because it starts off centralized, puts most of the onus of initial distribution on the DAO’s team and is more likely to trickle through and end up in the hands of valuable community members.


I like where the conversation is going! However, I’m not sure about this. In an ideal situation, every token holder would research their protocol, understand governance and delegate wisely. But- we’re not in an ideal world. Still, I do believe that a significant portion of the community would indeed be involved in governance, or at least delegate effectively. As you said, it’s not the focus of the proposal, but a neat conversation nonetheless.



 jose_delphi:

In all startups, it’s important to shorten the evolutionary cycle as much as possible, making small experiments, iterating and failing quickly in order to progress. This has arguably been Aave’s greatest strength so far and our fear with the concentrated power/capital model is that over time Aave’s size and the potential for contagion will impact its ability to do this.


I totally agree here. I’m still iffy on the whole aDAO situation (and to be honest, I’m not even sure we should implement an origination fee at all. I’m currently more in favor of redirecting a portion of depositor interest to the reserve(s)/stakers), but I am seriously leaning towards segregating insurance risk between different markets.
This is a fantastic discussion, and exactly what DeFi should be all about.

['Proposal: New Aave Token Architecture'],"Good catch.
@gyoung, appreciate the kind words and the support. Will answer your questions in turn:



 gyoung:

-The current stkAAVE yield isn’t very high at present, and where this design splits total yield across multiple segments as well as the ecosystem reserve, what mechanism is in place to ensure the yield is constantly adjusting to ensure the necessary supply of staking at each aDAO is met? For example, if there is close to zero participation for the lowest risk/ yield ecosystem reserve, is there any dynamic adjusting incentive to remedy this?



This is a great point. We’ve considered those kinds of mechanisms but ultimately we need to do some modeling to figure out what’s appropriate. All I would say here is that the aDAOs, similar to Aave itself, are more like startups than established banks/lending facilities. As such, the majority of cashflows are expected to come in the more distant future such that the yield in the short to medium term is more likely to be captured via $aDAO token appreciation as a result of increased traction vs actual fee yields.




 gyoung:

-Splitting the aDAOs for different assets makes perfect sense, but what if there is competition between the DAOs for an asset which is not clearly high or low risk? Clearly it would be sub-optimal to allow both DAOs to allow the asset, but how is this governed if both want to add the asset, and if DAOs have different views on the collateralization metrics around the asset (eg LTV)



This is another great point. We actually feel your specific example wouldn’t be too much of an issue since the aDAO mandates should be sufficiently differentiated and the risk framework well-defined enough that it should be clear where assets should sit. That said, a related edge case is where an aDAO initially has mandate over a risky asset which as time goes on becomes less risky such that it more appropriately fits into another aDAO’s mandate . This is also likely to coincide with that asset generating more fees which makes it problematic for the first aDAO which took the risk and is missing out on the upside.

There are solutions to this such as explicitly granting an aDAO a “license” over a certain asset for X time period to at least allow them to capture the upside for a fixed amount of time, after which it becomes an $stkAAVE holder decision where the asset should sit. Ultimately, we believe these protocol-wide decisions should be made by $stkAAVE holders in a way that benefits the entire ecosystem.



 gyoung:

-Some of the decision making left to the DAO I think is too complex to be left fully to the community without supporting risk analysis (eg Gauntlet) - most of us are not sophisticated enough to agree on the right parameters especially for new/ higher risk assets without this I think.



Agreed. Realistically, most aDAOs will initially be started either by Aave itself or by experienced members of the community who also have the most to gain in being early to a successful aDAO. Over time, this is where we see reputation playing an important role in helping to appropriately reward users who make value-add contributions over passive capital providers




 gyoung:

-I like the idea of the DXD reputation system - could we consider adding something similar to the YFI strategist fee reward where if an individual adds a new idea/ lending market which accrues fees for everyone the individual themselves is rewarded with X% of all fees…I think this will help to incentivize the community further to make sure they are innovating on behalf of the whole of AAVE.



This is a good idea. We could even build this into the reputation system such that the amount of reputation an individual gains is a function of the fees generated by their proposal. This all has to be carefully thought out and will be a research workstream of its own but this is exactly why we think reputation such an important primitive long-term.

@oaksprout Appreciate the kind words and also the TLDR synthesis you produced on Twitter. It was a great summary and exactly what we need to allow more people to engage with Aave governance. Going through your points in turn:



 oaksprout:

The franchise model does feel natural to me, but I’m curious if you considered any other designs?



Great question. We did consider quite a few other designs. One of the most promising alternatives was a more traditional tranched model. Rather than segmenting the safety pool, it would instead be split into tranches. Risk-averse users would take the senior tranche which has the lowest risk and upside whereas risk-loving users could take the junior tranches which carry more risk and more upside too. We could then have junior tranche holders have proportionately higher voting power since they effectively have higher skin in the game.

Ultimately, we decided on the aDAO model for a few reasons:
(1) unlike the tranched model, the aDAO model has the potential to make money-market creation permissionless as individuals come together and pool risk to spin up insured money-markets without requiring Aave’s consent
(2) Given fees will likely be kept low as Aave grows, we weren’t sure how a tranching model could work as returns to different tranches would have to be subsidized by Aave and if so, it becomes unclear how to determine the proper price for this
(3) Related to (2), since insurance is currently bundled in with the money-markets products, it becomes difficult to accurately calculate demand, capacity and therefore the price to pay to underwriters
That said, some of the feedback we’ve received on this proposal and further discussions with the Aave team have prompted us to re-evaluate the tranched design. We’re currently researching this and will keep the community posted.



 oaksprout:

I am in an aDAO and want to remove my funds, but this would pull capacity below MSR. Presumably I’m blocked from removing my funds?



Yes. Similarly to Nexus Mutual, withdrawals below the minimum capital requirement are locked.




 oaksprout:

Could the bonding curve accept assets other than $AAVE? This could increase adoption by decreasing required exposure to a foreign asset. Global governance to whitelist accepted collateral – e.g. $ETH and $DAI (if you’re into that).

The principle is – should someone using a protocol really need to take on financial exposure to that protocol? The question might be, are the users of a pool the same as the creators? My suspicion is that in many cases, they are.




We believe the bonding curve should accept only $AAVE since it forces every $aDAO holder to take on passthrough $AAVE exposure which should in turn encourage them to consider not just their own incentives as $aDAO holders but also the broader ecosystem incentives. Also, an $AAVE holder who wants to support an $aDAO should be able maintain some exposure to $AAVE. This serves to make $AAVE the reserve asset of the ecosystem and will result in more $AAVE being locked as the cashflows of all underlying aDAOs increase.

We definitely don’t think users should have to take on financial exposure to the protocol in order to use it. While initially in some cases the creators of an aDAO may also be its initial users, its important that their role as creator is separate from their role as user and entails some skin in the game in $AAVE for the reasons mentioned above.



 oaksprout:

A broader point I want to raise in the Aave community is around external asset ownership. To your point about making Aave more of a protocol I feel that some pool parameters should be open to voting purely by holders of the pool’s assets, and should not require any $AAVE to be held. Could be a change further down the line, but I think this change paves the way well by reducing contagion risk.



While I like the concept, I think there’s an incentive problem whenever the people voting on safety parameters aren’t the ones that have to bear the risk of their decisions. In general, we believe those with most skin in the game (i.e. those providing the insurance) should have highest influence on risk parameters. Imo, an alternative way of achieving your goal here is simply to distribute tokens ($aDAO or $AAVE) to holders of pool assets and encourage them to get involved in governance (for instance by mandating that X reputation be earned before they “unlock” their rewards)




 oaksprout:

Did you consider adding some measure of demand to the bonding curve? Currently the aDAO token has a deterministic price floor but I sense there’s an opportunity to bring more determinism as a function of demand. Potentially by taking trailing average fees, or fee levels as a direct input?

On that point, and I might’ve missed this, but how are pool fees set? At the risk of looking like a hammer, I sense it might be possible to pull this from the bonding curve.
Ironically I suspect that the more that can be deterministically factored in, the better it is for the Aave economy. More determinism → easier to trust → more $AAVE investment → more secure, better prices → more $AAVE investment etc. I think determinism could be a key input to Aave’s (and other protocols’) flywheel and therefore a key vector of defensibility.




This is a good idea and something we considered. Ultimately, we feel that, similarly to Aave itself, the aDAOs are fast-growing startups and their valuations will thus mainly be based on cashflows coming very far in the future. In addition, aDAOs may choose to set fees to 0 or even subsidize usage to gain market share and it wouldn’t be optimal for this to depress the $aDAO token price and thus its ability to attract capital. Rather than programatically set a relationship between fees and token price, we would rather set the relationship between price and system capacity and let the market decide what premium they want to pay on top of that.




 oaksprout:

In the case of a tail risk event, you propose an incentive pendulum. How does this work from a governance perspective? Is the functionality in place for pools by default, and enacted in via vote? Or could there be some more automated mechanism? e.g. reward flow as function of ratio of AUM to MSP.



We imagine this being an automated functionality, similar to the one governing liquidations.




 oaksprout:

You propose making it such that new pools are created and updated via AIP. My feeling is that for Aave to truly be an autonomous protocol, the aim should be for pool management to be entirely permissionless. This can be seen as an optimisation and introduced later, but I wonder if you think there’s scope for achieving that in this implementation, out of the gate? Or perhaps you feel that total software-mediation here is not desirable at all? If so, would be curious to hear why.



We feel this should definitely be the goal to strive for but to begin with we would like to keep it more permissioned such that Aave can operate the initial aDAOs itself and we can test out the process/assumptions.




 oaksprout:

Do you have any plans to make introductory content to this proposal available? It’s extremely dense and I think some other formats could help it spread through the community and get to resolution more quickly. (I’ve made a brief attempt on Twitter  .) Maybe a couple of videos – 1x high-level, 1x detailed – and jumping on the Delphi podcast would help?



Yes sir - really appreciated your tweet and it’s exactly the kind of thing we need to make governance more accessible. I’ve put up a video walkthrough to make this more digestible and we may also have an AMA with the Aave team on the proposal soon. Stay tuned for this :)

['Proposal: New Aave Token Architecture'],"Thanks for the thoughtful responses, José!

Tranched Model
I’m curious to read about the tranched model you mention. When we look back at the initial issues you sought to address – reducing contagion risk, expanding risk/reward diversity, boosting innovation – the tranched model does appear to move in that direction, but to a much, much lesser extent. Essentially it would offer 1 or 2 more levels of risk exposure, where the aDAO model could literally provide infinite. Would be curious to hear what feedback led to reconsidering the tranched model. I can see that from an implementation perspective it could offer a more manageable increment in complexity, but I sense you’re not shy about making larger changes to the protocol at such a nascent stage.

External aDAO Control



 jose_delphi:

I think there’s an incentive problem whenever the people voting on safety parameters aren’t the ones that have to bear the risk of their decisions


Funnily enough, this was precisely my concern. If Aave achieves protocol status, then it becomes a massive ecosystem player, whose decisions have major implications on the projects who implement it. Therefore, if external asset holders don’t have a vote on certain parameters, they have to bear the risk of a potentially arbitrary set of actors who don’t hold any skin in their game.
So I remain convinced that for Aave to achieve Protocol status, and the scale which is possible with that status, some element of ownership over aDAOs by the external assets they serve is essential. The simple reason is that Aave and credit in general is such an important component of the ecosystem and to the projects it integrates with, that an aDAO can become a risk to the project in and of itself. Take @Jordan’s recent post about governance attacks. Governance attacks don’t directly hamper Aave – they adversely affect the projects that implement Aave. You mention skin in the game, but the reality is that having skin in the Aave game is only one part of the problem – for implementing projects to trust aDAOs they need to feel like they have some control, too.
You mention the risk of using external assets to govern risk parameters that have potential to adversely affect Aave itself – to be clear, I’m not prescribing that. Concretely, the kind of parameters I suggest external asset holders can vote on are those that directly affect risk or functionality of external projects. For example, I suggested a binary option to allow external asset holders to vote on whether their pool issued a ‘marked’ token – a bToken – which could prevent governance attacks. Whether or not that idea has legs aside, it’s the kind of optionality which would inarguably make Aave a more desirable option for go-to credit protocol.
I recognise the idea of allocating aDAO tokens to external holders, but I must admit that feels like heavier work than simply using the assets themselves as aDAO governance tokens. Rather I would propose simply making it a parameter, votable on the aDAO – “for parameters X, Y and Z votes will be considered in tokens A, B and C.”

Determinism/Autonomy
Your answers to a couple of my questions around deterministic pricing and permissionless management for aDAOs were essentially “let’s leave it up to subjective consensus”, and I think that does feel sensible. Might be possible to push for greater determinism and autonomy later. 

Upgrades
A separate question which occurred to me – apologies if I’ve missed this in the text – is around what global upgrades would look like. For example, Ecosystem Governance decides that a new parameter is desirable for every aDAO template. How much choice do you imagine aDAOs having in deciding whether or not to upgrade? I’m imagining that if the ecosystem reserve and aDAOs are adequately aligned then the game theory should take of itself over time, but I wondered if you’d had any thoughts.




 jose_delphi:

I’ve put up a video walkthrough


Enjoyed the video! FWIW I didn’t mean “dense” negatively when talking about the proposal  Just meant very detailed lol.

Cheers!",51,65.2,2020-11-25
['Proposal: New Aave Token Architecture'],"Thanks @jose_delphi for share the extensive overview of the idea and proposal. After vibrant and active discussion, I want to jump in to comment on few points. Will bullet point my thoughts:

Stakers should be able to choose their risk/reward based on their appetite especially as the protocol grows and more markets are introduced
New markets might have more risk or even more risk
aDAOs are interesting way to slice risk into traches and allow the stakers to choose their risk appetite
IMO in current form SM is kind of mutual protocol wide protection, besides slicing the risk based on markets with aDAOs, various risks can be categorized. For example, staking AAVE into SM covers smart contract / technical risk - and staking StkAAVE to aDAOs cover market, liquidity risk etc. Issue here would be the custody for various aDAO1StkAAVE etc tokens for institutions (would require extra work and fragment the tokenization)
Easy solution to separate risk in tranches and adjust the rewards accordingly to the risk is to create three risk tranches: Junior, Mezzanine and Senior and adjusting “emission per second” distribution in staking contracts into these three tranches. This would address @Zer0dot’s point on having potential outflows
Lower tier (the Junior) can cover either higher risk market or take the higher portion risk of all money markets - this leads to higher rewards on Junior
Its important to consider the users, depositor might want to deposit into a more riskier market but also de-risk at the same time. The depositor should have a possibility to also subscribe to better protection of SM/aDAOs even in a riskier market
As new markets will become less riskier they can move between tranches as per Aave governance vote
The risk tranching should also reward de-risking - via lower Reserve Factor
On @Zer0dot liquidity thinning, I think liquidity spreading into various markets is not an issue since this gives an opportunity to build a Vault layer for the end users to choose to deposit between these three risk categories, a re-balancer could be build to move the deposits accordingly with the yields
On the reputation and voting, I see it also as interesting feature, would even think that “de-risking and yield score” could be something to consider

@gyoung’s point on the fees, we need to consider that the staking rewards would be re-calibrated by the aave governance soon and Aave Protocol v2 would have Reserve Factor that sets aside portion of the interest that can be distributed partly to stakers
The competition between aDAOs is something to consider but might not be a negative outcome - might be actually positive especially if the competition leads to reducing risk and optimizations

Tranching risk in general would benefit Aave Protocol, curious to see how this proposal and discussion evolves. Also would want to point out that technical implementation should be simple enough not to introduce substantial amount of complexity and technical risk.",47,174.4,2020-11-27
['Proposal: New Aave Token Architecture'],"Thanks for your input @stani!
Risk tranching is definitely an important aspect of Aave’s future development. Could be fascinating to perhaps split the SM into tranches where the junior tranche has a higher maximum slashing % and higher yield, whereas the senior has less yield and lower maximum slashing %.
Just a brain dump, but might be worth discussing.
As for the liquidity thinning aspect, I agree that it’s a non issue in the current model. Although, I believe that under the current proposal, aDAOs would have exclusive custody over their assets, preventing currencies from permeating into different markets.
I’m excited to potentially see this, alongside my previous points of concern, addressed in @jose_delphi’s proposal update!",38,37.6,2020-12-09
['Proposal: New Aave Token Architecture'],"There are many interesting ideas here. My main concern is the complexity and game theoretic aspects of the unforeseen market effects between all the potential aDAOs. Either way, until AAVE even reaches a point where this can be practically implemented (partially/fully), there are in my opinion the scaling issues to focus on first. Let’s rather improve the UX which at the moment, and it is not exclusive to AAVE but pertains to DeFi as a whole, sucks from a gas costs POV.

['Proposal: Add Support for USDN'],"Hello Aave community,
I’m Aleksei Pupyshev, a co-founder and developer at Neutrino Protocol
I’d like to make a proposal for Aave to support USDN as a collateral asset and currency. We think being able to lend and borrow USDN on Aave would open up new and unique opportunities for those who is looking for stable interest bearing assets.
What is USDN
Neutrino USD (USDN) is an algorithmic multichain stablecoin pegged to the US dollar and backed by WAVES. Leveraging the staking model of the Waves protocol’s underlying consensus algorithm, USDN staking yields a sustainable reward of up to ~ 15% APY.
For the one year since launch we have:
*** $230,000,000+** is the total value locked on the Neutrino smart contract (TVL) in dollar terms
*** 15,000+** is the number of protocol users
*** $8,000,000+** is daily trade volume on various exchanges (WX, KuCoin, Uniswap, Curve, 1inch, Bittrex, MXC)
*** $100,000,000+** is total liquidity on Сurve.fi 3Pool
*** $100.000,000+ is total market capitalization
*** Top-11 stablecoin on the market
The main feature of USDN is a staking and generating rewards from locked underlying asset (WAVES).
Benefits for Aave

More users re coming from Neutrino and Waves communities
More profitable DeFi-strategies (including arbitrage and leverage trading) will be available as integrations and partnerships with Curve, 1Inch, Uniswap, YearnFinance
USDN is a stakable asset, so it’s wrapped aUSDN version will be even more interesting for users and we’re expecting more liquidity & volumes for aUSDN too.

Although the Neutrino team never claimed to be able to replace a (central) bank, it has proven very well that an algorithmic stable coin mechanism can not only maintain a stable currency value, but can also create a stable foundation for DeFi as seen with the first decentralized FOREX. What Neutrino has achieved within this one year of existence is pretty remarkable, especially for a project that has not primarily outgrown the ETH ecosystem. Not even diving into the numbers here (APY, locked value, etc.) or the brilliant and dedicated team behind Neutrino.
However, it is not about blockchain-specific ecosystems, but rather about disrupting non-decentralized financial industries. And Aave has proven its disruptive nature as a leading DeFi protocol in 2020’s DeFi breakthrough with record growth numbers .
So, setting ecosystem tribalism aside while looking at actual track records in technology, growth and collaboration, I wouldn’t know any reason for Aave and Neutrino to not collaborate. It will surely be beneficial for both projects and most importantly for both of their users.

['Additional AAVE HODL benefits- Origination Fee'],"AAVE has a lot going on, staking, providing liquidity and has an amazing money market platform.
The idea and suggestion I would like to propose is creating a loan origination fee that goes to depositors that are also staking AAVE.
Loans are easy, which is good, but the amount in which loans are opened and closed, I believe should have some tiny fee that goes back to the collateral providers.
Maybe it’s all AAVE holders? I don’t know. With the money markets available on AAVE, compare this to uniswap for example. Deposits on AAVE are liquidity for others to utilize, there should be some additional incentive for depositing for collateral and the loans/funds being established. Again, nothing substantial but it should reward all depositors relative to the asset pool that crypto is being used as collateral.
For example:
$1000 USDC is deposited in total by all and can be used for collateral. People’s deposited contribution relative to the percentage overall during the mechanism of taking a loan should be considered.
If I have $100 deposited, or 10%, then each loan originated at the time of issuance should check the relative percentage of all, and this one time fee (let’s just say it’s .001% of the total loan should be distributed to the folks Proportionately providing collateral.
So if I was 10% of the total collateral, I would get 10% of the .001% origination fee.
Maybe have a stipulation for selecting collateral, that if you remove collateral in less than 30 days, you forfeit the fees.
Something like this, to incentivize folks, where the borrowers still won’t think twice about it and collateral providers are dually rewarded (APY + tiny fee for utilization).
To grow this market, users will need to be additionally incentivized.

['Discussion: Delist Assets with Low Utilisation?'],"Some assets have low utilisation. For example on Aave V1, only 1.91% of $1.4m Enjin Coin is being used.

Thoughts?",37,72.4,2020-12-27
['Discussion: Delist Assets with Low Utilisation?'],"@oaksprout thanks for opening the thread and giving highlight for the topic since the aim of Safety Module is to cover the asset-related risk of the system and for providing this protection the SM stakers are receiving AAVE rewards.
Indeed, ENJ has around 1.5 mm USD worth deposits with 1.91% of utilization. However, the utilization rate indicates the borrowing utilization, not for example how much ENJ has been used as a collateral, which is main use-case in the Aave Protocol.
I would confirm that the ENJ market is small (1.5 mm USD worth) at the moment, however it might currently create around 0.5-0.8 mm USD demand on stablecoin borrowings.
What would be interesting is to create a market for smaller market range collaterals, which would create some interesting yield rates for stablecoin depositors and at the same time de-risking the main pool. This would of course require that the SM would be tranched one way or another (see Delphi Digital discussion on the topic).",36,117.2,2020-12-27

Proposal by the Curve team
Following the initial proposal here , we’d like to submit CRV for polling below.
Curve is an exchange liquidity pool on Ethereum designed for extremely efficient stablecoin trading. It is the second biggest DEX on Ethereum and the third biggest protocol by TVL.
The newly launched CRV token is a governance token which also allows liquidity providers to boost their rewards on the platform as well as receive a share of trading fees on the Curve platform. Curve has recently reached over $10B in cumulative volume.
Users who vote lock their tokens (CRV => veCRV) receive a share of trading fees on the platform as well as a boost on their provided liquidity.

Risk Mitigation:
Curve DAO has been audited three times and is a fully decentralised Aragon DAO. Liquidity and trading volumes have been strong since launch. It currently has close to 12,000 holders as well as around 2600 governance participants. Looking at AAVE Risk Framework evaluation, I expect CRV to find itself around a B rating.

Joint Proposal by @ramaruro, @Estebank and @benlongstaff
In September 2020 we submitted a proposal to add TBTC (Bitcoin in Ethereum) to AAVE as Collateral for lending and borrowing: Proposal: Add support for TBTC
We want to give some updates on the growth of TBTC and poll the community concerning the listing of TBTC as collateral in AAVE
The following concerns were raised in the previous proposal, these will be addressed below:

Time being live on mainnet
Decentralisation of stakers
Available tooling for insights into the network

Here we also the address the following items:

Is TBTC a safe and suitable addition for lenders and borrowers and for the whole of the AAVE protocol
Liquidations
Deposits that failed to open

Details about TBTC
The tBTC system is developed by the Keep Network (https://keep.network/).
tBTC is

Decentralized, Trustless, Permissionless
Fully collateralized
Open Source, Audited

Each bitcoin deposit is stored in a separate wallet created by the signers. Depositors don’t have to trust custodians, aka signers, because signers deposit a 150% ETH bond of the value of the BTC they hold in custody and have a stake of KEEP tokens that can be slashed if there is collusion.
The permissionless nature can be summed up by
Question - “How many doors would you have to kick down to stop my TBTC being redeemed for BTC?”
Answer - “Good luck finding the doors”

Addressing Previous Concerns
1) Time live on mainnet
The tBTC system has been operating since September without any problems.
2) Decentralisation of stakers
There are 190 operators registered in the network, around 95 of those would have had their stake purchased on the market. Note that not all of the operators have finished setup on the network which is why this number is higher than the number of nodes listed in the main stats.
3) Available tooling for insights into the network
The tooling built by the community to gain insights into the network has matured significantly since launch.

Other Questions Answered
1) Total TBTC Supply:
You can see Statistics of TBTC live on https://keepstats.org/). Currently there are about ~1750 TBTC in circulation ⇒ ~$40M total TBTC value on Ethereum. If 10-12% of this comes to AAVE, i.e. ~$4.5M, that is similar to several other Assets currently available. Also, TBTC will grow significantly from there.
2) Is TBTC a safe and suitable addition for lenders and borrowers for the AAVE protocol ?
Depositor funds are given the highest priority in the network. 1 TBTC token is always backed by 1 BTC
Signers are randomly selected and put down a 150% bond in ETH for any BTC they take custody of.
The economic security model of over collateralisation protects depositors against

Being unresponsive in returning the deposited BTC
Signers colluding to steal the BTC deposit
Under collateralization

Failure to return a user’s BTC results in the signers’ ETH bonds being seized and auctioned off for TBTC.
3) Liquidations:
There have been 39 liquidations of ETH bonds since the network launch. This is the system acting as intended: https://allthekeeps.com/deposits/liquidations

All of the custodial risks are offloaded to the signers instead of the depositors.
Of the liquidations 38 were caused due to the collateralization level falling below 125% and 1 was due to operator error. Whenever a signer has an issue or misbehaves, it is the signer who loses funds. The depositor is always able to seize the signers bonds to recover their BTC.
4) Deposits that failed to open:
There are a large number of deposits that were not funded in time, causing them to entered a failed state. This was a result of operators stress testing the network at the beginning. Deposits that are not funded in time can be notified of timeout to free up the signers ETH bonds for further work.

ESD Summary:
ESD is an algorithmic stablecoin.
ESD leverages supply expansions and contractions to stabilize the price of ESD around $1. All supply adjustments (rebases) are incentivized, voluntary, and facilitated entirely on-chain.
ESD avoids the centralization risks found in USDC/USDT and can potentially scale easier than overcollateralized stablecoins such as DAI/sUSD.
With a market cap of $296MM, ESD is now one of the top 10 largest stablecoins. The liquidity profile, token distribution, and price discovery have improved significantly over the past 2 months (see below for details).
For details on the coupon system, rebasing, and broader mechanics, see below for additional links.
Aave x ESD:
Currently, ESD is not supported on any DeFi money market protocol. ESD can bring significant supply and borrow volume to Aave.
After analyzing on-chain activity, it is clear many market participants are speculating on the ESD peg by buying/selling ESD and participating in the protocol’s coupon system.
Adding ESD to Aave would enable traders to take directional views on the price of ESD. When ESD is below $1, traders can post ESD as collateral on Aave, borrow another stablecoin, and purchase additional ESD, effectively opening a leveraged long position. When ESD is above $1, traders can post an asset of their choice as collateral and borrow ESD, effectively opening a short position on ESD.
This activity is crucial for price stabilization and is commonly seen in other stablecoin markets including DAI.
As integrations and awareness for ESD improve, ESD can be used as a medium of exchange and potentially become the defacto stablecoin for DeFi. Aave is well positioned to capture the upside of this growth by being one of the first DeFi applications to integrate ESD with the appropriate risk parameters and guardrails.
In regards to composability, ESD is a standard ERC-20 token and removes the rebasing hurdles typically found in tokens such as AMPL.
Liquidity and Volume:
Currently, ESD is primarily traded on the ESD-USDC on Uniswap. Curve is also in the process of integrating ESD after the community voted in favor of creating a metapool for ESD. This should help significantly improve the liquidity profile of ESD given Curve’s inherent efficiency for trading stablecoins.
Uniswap ESD-USDC
Uniswap liquidity currently stands at $78.5MM, recently crossing a new ATH of $95.4MM earlier this week. The pool liquidity has increased by more than 100x over the past 2 months. Trailing 30-day average trading volumes stand at $5.2MM with a high of $15.7MM on 12/8/20.

['Do we like Aavenomics?'],"Let me first start my congragulations to Aave team for such an hard work and accomplishment on many innovations leading the defi world for years. I truly believe defi has long path to go, can be parabolic, and Aave can lead this trend. As I appreciated all remarkable improvement, i have to say Aavenomics is not one of them. The main concern on Aavenomics will be to mint extra 3mil tokens regardless for what will it be used. The approval of Aavenomics will be voted by the community which brings me to another major concern that the greater number of voting by random people, the greater risk of giving wrong decision. To mint extra token after white paper realeased should never be a topic for discussion in crypto world because its against the natural cause why the first crypto, BTC, was born,Unlimited supply of fiat money. Never have an perception of possible unlimited supply. Even though Aave Team says that they will vote Aavenomics, the idea of minting tokens will create fear and doubt in people’s mind if they re having thought to invest, stake and hold Aave. It can cause inflanatiory moves as well. Once people has perception of minting tokens whenever its necessary for any reason, the token will lose its value eventually. As a result, we all want to own something valuable and so far the initial, clearest and strongest reason for being valuable is limited supply in the longrun. In my opinion its better to keep it in that way. Dont create the perception of incerasing supply!",162,2222.4,2020-07-30
['Do we like Aavenomics?'],"BTC supply can be adjusted if enough people decide that its necessary. Its just code.
In the case of AAVE its important to note what the tokens will be used for and thats utility / security / etc incentives. This is good for the protocol and will encourage broader usage which means indirect / direct benefit for AAVE holders.

['Do we like Aavenomics?'],"Looks good to me. Sure "" burn good, print bad""  is true as a general guideline, but it’s not an absolute.
What you absolutely don’t want indeed is tokens being printed and handed out to team members to basically sell off at will, or surprise minting. So it is important that the smart contract makes sure that there will be no more tokens minted after this initial one (which requires long term planning for how to manage incentives in the future all this one time 3M pool).
That being said in the big picture, if these tokens are all used to incentivise the community to stabilise and grow the ecosystem they will ultimately increase the AAVE price rather than decrease. Why? Because defi is some bubble heavy shit. That’s also a good things, and we are early bubble stage, but as the godfather Vitalik Buterin himself said that also means that irresponsible people will try to get rich off of irresponsible and unsustainable platforms: and it is exactly through the measures as proposed by the team that AAVE differentiates from that in staying responsible and sustainable. And the community is needed for that and the best community effort is one with fair incentives.
And these tokens will anyway hit the market earliest in 1 to a few years getting released to community contributors slowly and by that time I am sure that the natural growth of a healthy and sustainable ecosystem will rocket the price up way more than the inflationary effect of these tokens. Even more as soon as the first existing or emerging AAVE competitors with unsustainable yield farming lures get their bubble popped when the chips are down. Especially if fee burns remain, partially the effect will mitigated over time anyway  (be it very slowly).",126,150.2,2020-07-30
['Do we like Aavenomics?'],"I understand your concern, but please also consider the following:

you cannot compare AAVE to BTC or any other project  but since you are, you can also look at ETH which has no supply cap and shows no sign of loss in value, also look at SNX whose growth can be attributed to a great rewards system among other reasons
contributors to the Safety Module and liquidity providers must be rewarded for their contribution and a “reward from fees” would not be a great enough incentive to ensure growth and security

IMO looking at the extra 3m tokens from only a price perspective does not paint the whole picture and I support the swap and the supply figures proposed by the team.",110,97.0,2020-07-30

 Severini:

The approval of Aavenomics will be voted by the community which brings me to another major concern that the greater number of voting by random people, the greater risk of giving wrong decision.


This seems like a strong assumption.
On a philosophical point of view, democracies have their flaws but taking “wrong-er” decision than autocracies isn’t one of them. It might be slower to get things approved, and less extreme (both ways: good or bad), democracies are more “channeled”.
If you are part of a community, sharing investments/ideologies/interest, you probably have many peeps, with different backgrounds, opinions, etc. Decision making should end-up more round.
However, on the velocity aspects, the governance model could be built in a way to fasten decision making while keep safety-nets. DeFi, is moving at a crazy speed, and and it seems, governance shouldn’t be in the way to fast evolution.

['Proposal: Add support for BBTC (Binance BTC)'],"Proposal: Support/List/Add BBTC on Aave, as the collateral asset.
Thanks, everyone, here’s the proposal by @Helen_ACE, The Binance Btoken Team, Contact us: [buidl@binance.org]
Brief introduction of BBTC.
BBTC (Binance BTC) is the ERC20 token on the Ethereum network created via the Binance Token Canal program, launched on the 31.Otc 2020. Binance will lock a portion of tokens on their own native chains and mint the same number of tokens as ERC20 tokens on Ethereum with a naming convention of BBTC. Deposits and withdrawals for BBTC are enabled on [binance.com] by 31.Oct.2020
Click to check the official announcement.
Current Liquidity and the strategy of BBTC. Why should we have it?
BBTC Contract: (https://etherscan.io/address/0x9be89d2a4cd102d8fecc6bf9da793be995c22541)
BBTC was just launched last week, which is a very important strategy of the Binance and Binance community to support cross-chain assets and liquidities, and we are approaching/ adding liquidity to the top DeFi protocols of Ethereum;
Here’s the list we are going to add BBTC in the coming weeks: Uniswap, Aave, Curve, Compound, Cream, Fortube(Listed), MakerDao, Balancer, InstaDapp, and more.
(will keep you updated under this thread)
Benefits for [Aave] and the general DeFi Community
1）Larger User Bases and Liquidity Growth:
Binance is one of the largest crypto exchanges, and >15m Binance communities can potentially contribute to the DeFi eco-system. BBTC will become an important bridge between CeFi and DeFi worlds, which will introduce quite decent liquidity in the DeFi eco-system in Ethererum.
2）Risk Mitigation:

BBTC is an ERC20 token on the Ethereum network that represents a 1:1 peg of the same asset on their own blockchain.
Heightened security and risk control measures for the wrapped tokens are in place, as well as using the SAFU fund to ensure the safety of users’ assets.

BBTC might become an incentive token in the future, the holder will share a savings revenue of the BBTC they hold. (features are in design).
How to Exchange BBTC on Binance?
Binance.com users can deposit or withdraw BTokens by selecting the ERC20 network option in the Binance.com wallet when trying to deposit or withdraw. For example, BBTC is the BToken token representing BTC wrapped on Ethereum:

To withdraw BBTC, users need to select the ERC20 network and input an ERC20 address on the BTC withdrawal page.
To deposit BBTC users need to select the ERC20 network when depositing BTC and acquire the ERC20 deposit address for BTC.

Furthermore, In the mid of Nov, Binance Bridge can support to transfer in/out of the BTC from the bitcoin network to Ethereum or vice versa, which will need a Binance.com account.

['Proposal: Add support for BBTC (Binance BTC)'],"Besides that binance has a large user base, the Binance ecosystem contains almost the most active users in DeFi, Market Makers, tons of arbitrageurs, holders look for a higher APY, those DeFi projects which had listed their tokens on binance, they will potentially have BTC in binance, and might need to transfer BTC ERC-20 to the DeFi world, e.g. Aave.
BBTC it’s a good bridge/cross-chain service to connect CeFi and DeFi protocols, which means that users can quickly use binance.com or simply use binance bridge(decentralize tools) to convert their BTC to BBTC (ERC20), at the same time enjoy service with a high standard of security. It’s a good idea to list BBTC and to provide a solid option to users.
Not sure if Aave would list all kinds of BTC wrapped tokens (WBTC, RenBTC, imBTC, Binance BTC), we recommend listing more and bring more users and assets into this eco-system.

The core of this AIP is to implement an option to bypass Step 4 of the AIP process, allowing any AAVE holder with enough assets to submit an AIP to the decentralised Aave governance.
Moving forward, the Aave Genesis Team will be just one of many innovation forces of the Aave Protocol.
The current model of the V1 governance only allows the Aave Genesis Team to submit AIPs as binding governance proposals. With this proposal, any Aave community actor meeting the requirements will be able to create an AIP for binding votes.
Users who possess a direct stake in the Aave ecosystem should have proportional power to govern it. Consequently, the new governance module aims to bring inclusivity, whilst simultaneously guaranteeing the safety and decentralisation of the Aave ecosystem.
Aave V2 governance is inspired by delegation-based governance models already on the market, while introducing 3 key innovations and a new layer of resilience:


The introduction of a new concept in DeFi governance - the segregation between voting and proposition power to increase control and ownership of voting rights for AAVE holders.
AAVE holders will have the choice between delegating proposal creation power to specialized actors while holding their voting rights; or even delegating them to another entity.


Voting strategies - The AAVE token exists and is used in the Aave ecosystem in a variety of ways. Through different voting strategies, AAVE in different forms can be used to vote. In the initial implementation both AAVE and stkAAVE holders will have voting rights. Voting strategies can be upgraded at any time through a governance proposal to include other forms of AAVE (i.e. aAAVE, staked AAVE/ETH AMM shares, etc.)


Multiple executor entities - Different components of the ecosystem might have different needs for consensus and security. For example, changing the AAVE token logic itself might have a large impact on the ecosystem and is something that requires higher consensus than adjusting a risk management parameter. The Aave governance V2 splits the control of different entities within the Aave ecosystem between different executors with different execution delays (timelocks) and different consensus parameters. At the beginning there will be two different executors:
a. Executor 1 (short timelock) will control the whole Aave Protocol v1, the token distributor used in v1, the contract collecting the v1 fees, the AAVE Reserve Ecosystem and any change in this timelock itself. Once the break-in period for Aave V2 is completed, this timelock will also control the current Aave V2 market and all the future markets instantiated by the Aave Genesis Team.




admin (the only address that can interact with this executor): Aave Governance v2


delay (time between a proposal passing and its actions executing): 1 day


grace period (time after the delay during which the proposal can be executed): 5 days


proposition threshold: 0.5%


voting duration: 3 days


vote differential: 0.5%


quorum: 2%


b. Executor 2 (long timelock)will control the upgradeability of the AAVE token, stkAAVE, any change in v2 governance parameters and any change in the parameters of this timelock itself.


admin: Aave Governance v2


delay: 7 days


grace period: 5 days


proposition threshold: 2%


voting duration: 10 days


vote differential: 15%


quorum: 20%



The Guardian - As long as a large majority of AAVE tokens are in a centralised exchange, it’s impossible to prevent a STEEM-like governance attack where a centralised entity would use its users’ assets to take over a decentralised protocol through governance. As a security measure to avoid such a scenario, a temporary 5/10 multisig is given a power of veto to cancel proposals in case malicious code is introduced through an AIP. Those entities have been chosen within the AAVE community to be globally distributed, and they cover safety skill sets through governance, code, and economic analysis. Guardians can be changed later through election.
The current multisig signers are : James Vaugh (Fire Eyes/Metacartel), Anthony Sassano (SET protocol/ETHhub/Daily Gwei), Mariano Conti (ex MakerDAO head of smart contracts), Tarun Chitra (Gauntlet), DeFiSaver, Zerion, Parafi Capital, Framework Venture, Arthur0x and the Aave Genesis Team

Some of the expected short-term outcomes of this implementation are new actors creating proposals for token additions, risk parameter upgrades or new liquidity market creation.

Excited to see governance come to light- and the guardian system is an interesting strategy to mitigate centralization risk. We’ve got a strong cast of guardians!
Just to make sure I grasp the structure correctly I’ve got a couple of questions: Is the vote differential the vote difference that must be present in order to implement a proposal? I.e: For a proposal built on the short timelock executor, 49.75% against and 50.25% for would pass, but 49.9% against and 50.1% would not, is that right?
Similarly, for major token or governance upgrades, 42.5% against and 57.5% for would be the minimum ratio to pass, correct?
Lastly, when you state the quorum numbers, is this as is usually implied, where a 2% quorum means that at least 2% of the total supply must vote, regardless of voting direction?
Or is it the more recent definition of quorum, where a 2% quorum implies that at least 2%of the supply must vote for a certain proposal in order for it to pass?

['[Delegation Pitch] Towards the Future of Aave'],"Hey everyone!
Recently, Aave’s V2 governance went live, and I’m more than excited to see the protocol grow. We’ve got lots to do, ranging from adding new tokens like CRV into current markets to creating entirely new additional markets (cough UNI-V2 cough)!
On that note, I wanted to write a short post describing just how important it is for anyone and everyone with an interest in Aave to participate in governance.
Aave is currently shaping up to be the leading money market protocol in DeFi. This is great… But broaden your horizon! I wager that one day, “decentralized finance” will become just “finance,” and when that day comes, I want to see Aave lead the charge.
If you want to see that vision come to fruition too, cast your votes!
Whether or not you decide to delegate to someone or to vote for yourself, you’re now responsible for what could potentially be one of the greatest financial revolutions in modern history… Don’t stay on the sidelines!
Alright, with that out of the way, I wanted to let you all know that I’m running as a delegate for Aave. I’m not a financial expert or a core developer, I’m just a regular person that believes in the protocol, and I want to do my part.
Every single one of my decisions will be aligned with the following principles:

Simplicity
Security
Long-Term Vision
Proper Risk Management
Bridging TradFi
Funding Innovation
Rewarding Stakers
User Experience
Transparency
Communication

I go into each and every one of these more in depth in my medium article, which is also where you’ll find the delegation address!
My goal is to allow as much thoughtful open discourse as possible. Everyone has a voice and should be heard. Delegating to me is delegating to my principles.
Moving forward, I’d like to focus our attention on two specific proposals that I believe will set an important precedent:

Implementing a UNI-V2 liquidity pool token market
Rescuing the AAVE and LEND locked in their respective contracts

The first transitions Aave from a regular lending product to a full-fledged multi-market lending protocol; the second shows that we, as a DAO, can mobilize for a good cause.
In closing, I fundamentally believe that Aave and DeFi as a whole can really revolutionize finance as we know it, and I absolutely can’t wait!

UPDATE 1
The community seems to favor a quarterly emission rather than a first year emission. The reevaluation of the emission each quarter allows to adapt to the fast pace of defi incentives.
The community seems to agree with an emission of 685 AAVE/day for the Ecosystem Incentives (for protocol growth)
The community seems in favor of raising the AAVE emission for the staking rewards (aka Safety Incentives). Considering that 685 AAVE/day equal to a yearly emission 250K AAVE, which is essentially slightly less than 2% APR with the Safety Module completely full ( the whole AAVE supply locked in it)
One idea could be to double this amount for the first 4 months, to incentivize early migration, staking and also locking of the initial ecosystem incentives. This would equal to an emission of 1370 AAVE/day, equivalent to a 4% APR with the stake full.",233,10586.6,2020-07-30

Another positive for borrowers and lenders alike is security which is provided by SM.
Thus, it makes sense to reward depositors, with rewards locked up for at least a month.
Regarding the stakers/insurers, the 2% inflation of the entire Aave supply in circulation is reasonable because they will benefit from Aave fees, Balancer distribution and Balancer fees alongside Aave rewards.

First year AAVE emissions:
1 & 2: Setting a per day allocation of AAVE rewards makes sense – However setting 12 months for the AAVE/day rate might be a little over committed, perhaps setting this rate for quarters at a time makes more sense?
Just cautious of the effect the AAVE token price has on these allocations.
3: This system makes a lot of sense in terms of encouraging Ecosystem rewards to flow into the Safety Module – I wonder if these numbers could start higher (2%-5%?) then drop over time (to >1% - 1%) as the Safety Module gets more and more established?
16.6% of the total AAVE reserve allocated in the first year makes sense & is a reasonable allocation.",143,163.6,2020-07-30
['Initial discussion: AAVE reserve emission for safety and ecosystem incentives'],"I agree with James, it might be more flexible to go on a quaterly allocation.
Curious to know what others think about it ?

It gives more flexibility to adapt in ever changing environment, and its closer to the reality as even with a 1 year commit, governance would still have power to change allocation during the year. So quaterly seems more reasonnable.

3. If quaterly schedule is accepted, then it makes more sense to start with a higher number for the “Ecosystem reward to Safety Module” incentive, at least for the first 2 quarter to bootstrap the habits of depositing mined AAVE directly in the SM.
Higher reward for stakers :
It’s about maintaining the balance, the value proposition of the stake is already an incentive for LPs as their deposit would now be covered by design, however i’m not sure most LPs would recognise it as such in the beggining and having good bootstrapping liquidity for them is also important
Taker / Maker Split :
I completely agree, this is bad practice to encourage high leverage. However i think its still important to cover their cost in the bootstrapping phase so i would support a 90/10 split between depositors and borrowers
Vesting of reward : Interesting thought, but imo those who come to dump, will dump no matter the locking period. I think its more interesting to design incentives within the ecosystem to make sure its more attractive to reuse AAVE rather than selling it.
So, as a LP, I would mine AAVE, then be incentivized to deposit it in the SM and within the SM I would mine more AAVE with my AAVE (+ potentially Aave fees, BAL, Balancer pool trading fees) and the SM would have a cool down period to withdraw.",138,157.6,2020-07-30
['Initial discussion: AAVE reserve emission for safety and ecosystem incentives'],"I agree with @monet-supply that we should focus on supply side for providing markets and to avoid so called wash borrowing. Similarly as @ashwathbk mentioned as well, we should avoid the scenario where “fast food” farmers are farming for short-term gains by selling their crops for cashflow.
Governance tokens are not cashflow and incentives should be aligned to the direction that liquidity providers are incentivized to stake whatever they are earning back to the network to provide security. This actually provides also additional yield for the liquidity providers and they become network security participants. Participants who are participating in securing the network might have higher risk awareness and value protocol health more than liquidity providers that are looking for short term gains.
There are no shortage of liquidity providers in DeFi and dedication to provide long-term liquidity should be rewarded, without limiting composability. Rewarding long-term LPs would democratise also earnings since gas costs eats the yields of smaller LPs and smaller LPs might be less keen on optimizing their yields in DeFi, rather they want to park their funds to a safe harbour that yields better than their fiat equivalents.",133,236.6,2020-07-30

Hi Jordan, I have to disagree with you there. You cannot design a system with time-limited inflationary rewards for AAVE and expect the value of the token to remain stable once the reward period ends, people will logically cash out at that point and look for the next farm. The rewards only from staking AAVE cannot by definition be as high as when the rewards period is active.
It is in AAVE stakers’ interests to try and keep the token valuation as high as possible and incentivising short term farming schemes is not the way to achieve this.
I think SNX is the example to follow here; rewards from staking SNX are vested for a year, well after the reward periods end and the value of their token has continued to increase over time.",116,63.2,2020-07-30
['Initial discussion: AAVE reserve emission for safety and ecosystem incentives'],"Hello guys

My point was that instead of purely locking the token there might be more elegant ways to do it by having a positive feedback loop where :
You are a stablecoin LP and farmed AAVE, you can withdraw it and do what you want with it BUT if you actually keep it in the ecosystem and directly stake it in the SM, then you get a reward for that behaviour + you will start accruing further AAVE (+ fees etc) by staking the farmed AAVE, create interesting dynamics.
I’m not personally a huge fan of locking tokens for the point of locking them.

Hey everyone,
Just to be sure i got all of this right, i made a quick board about the update of proposal 1, can you confirm ? (Sorry i coulndt find how to add a pdf or a spreadshit)
QUARTER 1 : NB token & % Supply
Staking :
Per day  : 1370 -> 0,046%
Per Quarter : 125012,5 -> 4,167%
LP :
Per day : 1370 -> 0,046%
Per Quarter : 125012,5 -> 4,167%
Bonus incentive :
Per day : 13,698 -> 0,0005%
Per quarter : 1250 -> 0,0417%
QUARTER 2, 3 and 4
Staking :
Per day :  685 -> 0,023%
Per Quarter:  62506,25 -> 2,084%
LP :
Per day :  685 -> 0,023%
Per Quarter :  62506,25 -> 2,084%
Bonus :
Per day : 6,849 -> 0,0002%
Per Quarter : 625 -> 0,0208%
Total per Year 1 :
Staking : 312531,25 -> 10,42%
LP :  312531,25 -> 10,42%
Bonus : 3125 -> 0,104%
Total général : 628187,5 -> 20,940%
Then, if this is correct, i think the LP should get more than reward staking, because of the impermanent loss risk. I also think that the bonus should really be more than 0.1% emission in year one, in order to really incite farmers to compound interests by staking claimed rewards, or maybe even a possibility to redirect rewards it to avoid gas fee claim.
The 21% of supply emission for year one seems great, maybe we can push to 30% so 900K AAVE, that could be distributed like this :

10% for rewards staking - 300K AAVE/Year
14% for liquidity providers - 420K AAVE/Year
6% bonus to incite compound interests180K/Year (Locking period needed)
This way, those who choose staking only without claiming get a good 16%, and those who Lp, 20% + others farming tokens, which will boost liquidity in my opinion.
Of course this would only be for Year one, and year two would be by divided by 2.5 or 3.

Looking forward to get others opinions on this :)",130,216.0,2020-07-30

Introduction of H-Tokens (HBTC & HFIL)
H-token series are a suite of assets issued on Ethereum and backed by cryptocurrencies from other blockchains to bring more digital assets to the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem.
The issuance of the H-Tokens will allow more users in the crypto world to benefit from DeFi, accelerate the development of the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem, and promote the growth of Ethereum-based assets.
HBTC as well as HFIL has enabled BTC and FIL users to seamlessly access Ethereum DeFi protocols such as Uniswap, Curve, Nest, CoFix, ForTube and more. And its growing use cases prove that the value has been recognized by the market.
Use Cases (examples):

Juan Benet, the founder of Filecoin, praised HFIL on Twitter, thinking that using HFIL and DeFi, anyone can migrate FIL to Ethereum and use smart contracts to handle various things. Miners can rely on DeFi infrastructure and loan market.
Juan Benet’s Twitter 1

HBTC pool is available on Curve since Sep 10th and liquidity providers can then deposit HBTC there to earn trading fee reward and CRV reward.

How to Get H-Tokens (HBTC, HFIL)?
To meet users’ fast exchange of H-Tokens, Huobi Global will take the lead in supporting H-series. Users can choose HBTC (or other H-Tokens like HFIL) when withdrawing their BTC (or other original asset like FIL)
a) Buy, deposit or get BTC through trading and save it in the Exchange account on Huobi Global
b) Select BTC (or other original asset e.g. FIL) - Withdraw - HBTC (or other H-Tokens e.g. HFIL) in the Exchange account
c) Enter the address and amount for withdrawal and click “Withdraw”

Benefits for AAVE：
Huobi Group has maintained more than 15 million users in the world, and H-Tokens like HBTC as well as HFIL play the key roles to bridge the BTC and FILECOIN users to Ethereum ecology in participating the DeFi activities. And as witnessed, market needs of HBTC and HFIL jump sharply. Thus, having HBTC and HFIL listed on AAVE would surely introduce quite a decent amount of liquidity to AAVE and to benefit the growth of AAVE. Let’s hold hands to achieve DeFi ecological prosperity.

['Proposal: Add Support for HBTC&HFIL'],"All wrapped forms of Bitcoin come with trade-offs, there is no doubt about that. wBTC will be centralized forever and that carries those risks we are aware of. sBTC and tBTC both use the collateral and liquidation model, and that brings with it dangers of a collapse of the peg if there is too much volatility too fast, and problems with scaling liquidity. Ren uses fees and cash flow to secure the system, which requires a level of adoption before it can securely be decentralized (and therefore it starts out centralized as it is now).
This diversification of risk is good for us, because right now we are still so early, and we don’t know very well how things will play out in the future. If any of these models fail, we have other ones to fall back on.
However, Hbtc does have its advantage. Hbtc is backed by Huobi Group, with more than 15 Million users, and a history of 7 years’ stable operation. Currently Hbtc moves smoothly on its compliance process.",7,6.4,2020-12-14

title: Activation of Aave Protocol Governance V2
status: Proposed
author: Marc Zeller (@marczeller)

created: 2020-12-11
updated: 2020-12-11

## AIP rationale

Aave V2 governance is inspired by delegation-based governance models already on the market, while introducing 3 key innovations and a new layer of resilience:

The introduction of a new concept in DeFi governance - the **segregation between voting and proposition power** to increase control and ownership of voting rights for AAVE holders.
AAVE holders will have the choice between delegating proposal creation power to specialized actors while holding their voting rights; or even delegating them to another entity.

**Voting strategies** - The AAVE token exists and is used in the Aave ecosystem in a variety of ways. Through different voting strategies, AAVE in different forms can be used to vote and create proposals. In the initial implementation both AAVE and stkAAVE holders will have voting and proposal creation rights. Voting strategies can be upgraded at any time through a governance proposal to include other forms of AAVE (i.e. aAAVE, staked AAVE/ETH AMM shares, etc.)

**Multiple executor entities** - Different components of the ecosystem might have different needs for consensus and security. For example, changing the AAVE token logic itself might have a large impact on the ecosystem and is something that requires higher consensus than adjusting a risk management parameter. The Aave governance V2 splits the control of different entities within the Aave ecosystem between different executors with different execution delays (timelocks) and different consensus parameters. At the beginning there will be two different executors:

['Proposal: Add support for $BASED & mbBased to AAVE'],"I would like to propose that AAVE add support for both the $BASED and mbBased tokens. $BASED also known as Based.Money is a decentralised rebasing stablecoin asset where a stable price level is targeted via a variable supply and a notionally pegged price as opposed to a variable price and a fixed supply. Unlike AMPL who have attempted to peg to USD, $Based is attempting to peg 1 $Based to 1 sUSD (Synthetix sUSD – the most decentralised liquid stablecoin in DeFI currently). Details around the protocol’s specific methodology for rebasing can be found on the website: https://based.money
One other important difference from AMPL is the community driven ‘fair launch’ approach driven by a great anonymous cabal know as ’The Ghouls’. The ‘fair launch’ distribution meant that there were no ‘founders rewards’, no ‘team allocations’, no ‘ecosystem allocations’, and that everyone had an equal chance to ‘farm’ the currency during its ‘pool 0’ and ‘pool 1’ phases.
The other important thing to note is that the $BASED money protocol is effectively immutable as the ‘keys’ have been burnt. There is no in protocol governance nor ability for centralised actors to interfere with the operation of the currency.
While Based Money was originally, in the words of the founders:
“The BASED Protocol is a DeFi game of chicken designed to shake out weak hands and yield the highest gains for those who understand the rules…The $BASED token combines a simplified version of Ampleforth’s economic policy with YFI’s distribution mechanism. The result is a post-modern economic game that continually resets. The barrier of entry is fair and balanced for all participants.” It has now progressed beyond this initial conception via multiple novel, innovative and community focused decentralised finance innovations including Based Collective (NFTs and Based art/memes) & Moonbase (community focused, collaborative, positive EV farming), and the Ghouls pioneering NFT backed debt.
The Ghouls most recent innovation is mbBased, this acts as a standard erc-20 (no rebasing) and represents the proportionate share of any individuals % ownership of $Based. As such mbBased provides a much simpler way for projects to integrate Based Money due to the lack of rebasing (holders still get rebased on their underlying $Based tokens).To get mbBased, $Based holders stake their $Based in the Moonbase, where other projects are able to deploy rovers and farm their tokens and slowly sell them over the course of a year. In return they access the power of the Based community via memes and other support. The gains from these Rover farms are used to market buy $Based and return that $Based to the Moonbase when the rugpull function is called. There are 3 projects currently deploying rovers, with another 7 lined up in the short term. Demonstrating the power of the Based community, approximately 70% of $Based is locked in the Moonbase earning an APY of .3%, and mbBased was a comfortable winner in round 1 of Yield Wars.
Liquidity:
$BASED and $mbBASED are currently traded on Uniswap. The two main pairings are $BASED/sUSD and $mbBASED/$BASED.
Liquidity is set to increase as the ecosystem grows and gains more traction. In particular liquidity incentives are planned around the development of Based v1.69.

Benefits for AAVE:
AAVE will benefit by having two new & novel stablecoin like assets to offer users (one rebasing and one non-rebasing) leading to greater revenues, TVL & protocol liquidity. Having these assets also helps to de-risk the AAVE portfolio by introducing non-correlated & decentralised assets.
The other benefit is the co-operation between the AAVE and BASED communities, Based<>Aave memes, and future benefits to AAVE as a result of upcoming Based developments such as Based.Swap/Based v1.69",70,1734.0,2020-11-05

['Proposal: Add support for OMG (OMG Network)'],"Hello,
I’m a Community Consultant for OMG Network and would like to make a proposal to add OMG to AAVE for lending and borrowing.
1. Who is the interested party for this collateral application?
OMG Network and its strong community would be interested in lending and borrowing on the AAVE platform.
We have recently won a Community Greenlight poll over at MakerDAO: Community Poll
2. Brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token.
The OMG Network is a Layer-2 value transfer network for ETH and any ERC-20 token.
The Network is a scalability solution for the Ethereum Network and intends to reduce the high transaction fees and network congestion facing the blockchain.
The OMG Token is a fee token that can be used to pay for any ERC-20 transactions on the OMG Network, thereby, reducing Ethereum’s network congestion and transaction fees for all.
The token will later serve staking purposes as OMG Network’s consensus algorithm will be migrated to Proof-of-Stake.
3. Brief history of the project.
Initially known as OmiseGo, the ICO raised over $25 million around July 2017.
3 years later, during the summer 2020, the project is rebranded OMG Network as the company announce the public Mainnet beta.
Shortly after, mid-August, Bitfinex integrates with OMG Network allowing to scale USDt transactions. There are more integrations actively being worked on at present.

['Increase liquidation threshold of USDC to 99%'],"tldr: If USDC peg breaks, Aave will anyway suffer (as will all of DeFi). We might as well fully absorb the risks of a USDC peg break. Borrowing will become as efficient as buying, and USDT will be shortable without locking up capital.

USDC currently has a maximum LTV (loan to value) of 80% and a liquidation threshold of 85%. This is in place so that if the USDC peg breaks, liquidators can hopefully liquidate all USDC collateral, before on-chain liquidity disappears. Unlike most assets, a peg break will likely be gradual, and then rapid, so it is questionable whether liquidation will even be possible. At this time, all of DeFi will be trying to sell off their assets on places like Uniswap and Curve, including LPs themselves who are pulling liquidity. Even if liquidation is possible, DeFi will enter a bear market that affects AAVE holders.
Instead of this, Aave could consider a system where they fully inherent the risks of a USDC peg break, in return for increased capital efficiency.
Instead of buying asset X using USDC, users will now consider using Aave to borrow the same asset X against their USDC. Since no excess USDC is “wasted” to maintain LTV ratios, the latter will be as appealing as the former. Interest rates will more closely resemble the real demands for assets, and Aave usage will increase.
Additionally this can be used by on-chain actors to short stablecoins. One can imagine a scenario where all users who do not believe in the USDT peg will borrow USDT against their USDC collateral. They can then use USDT to buy whatever assets they want to, as before. If USDT peg breaks, they owe back nothing and essentially double their money. If USDT peg does not break, they pay an annual interest rate of a few %, but they will still be able to buy all the other assets they wanted to. Aave can become the ultimate destination to short USDT without locking up your capital in the short.",44,268.8,2020-12-06
['Creating a market for insured real-world assets and bringing institutional investors to Aave'],"Proposal: Add Support for CrescoFin Regulated Insured Money Market
We propose to add a money market to the Aave protocol that would allow compliant investors to gain exposure to asset-backed cashflows from the real economy.  The cashflows generated through CrescoFin, a regulated Swiss company, are fully insured by the Lloyd’s insurance market in London.  The interest rate to be paid is 3.00% (on an annual basis), significantly above interest rates paid on traditional secure savings products. 
The Proposal allows investors to deposit USDC and receive iCRES tokens that offer an insured rate of interest.  These tokens are fungible ERC20 tokens and can be traded anywhere in DeFi on Ethereum, as long as the receiving address is compliant.
Motivation
The Proposal is intended to allow Aave investors to participate in low-risk, real-world assets.  Most of the lending in DeFi to date has been based on overcollateralization of crypto assets.  This Proposal realizes Aave’s intention to expand into lending against future cashflows in the real world, as is more common in traditional finance.  The market size is enormous. 
We also expect that the Proposal will attract significant interest from traditional financial investors, acting as an entry point to the crypto world via Aave and furthering crypto adoption.  CrescoFin is committed to bringing our institutional investors to Aave.

About CrescoFin 
CrescoFin is a regulated financial institution in Switzerland, built on a blockchain tech stack, whose objective is to replace banking with code.[2]  The company operates in the traditional finance space in USD, EUR and CHF, focused mainly on institutional investors and is developing an offer in stablecoins.  More details are available here: https://defi.crescofin.ch and here: https://medium.com/crescofin/replacing-banking-with-code-db196c27e010
How it works 

CrescoFin purchases (and takes ownership of) invoices to be paid by a diverse group of investment-grade companies in the real world (the Buyer in the graph below).
The services provided to the Buyer by the Seller are recorded on-chain.[4] This removes the possibility of disputes between the parties.  CrescoFin only finances (purchases) invoices in respect of which the Buyer agrees to pay, at a later date (usually from 7- 30 days). 
CrescoFin arranges and pays for credit insurance in case the Buyer does not pay. The Aave investors would be the beneficiaries (the Loss Payees) of this insurance policy. 
The payments of these invoices flow into a fiduciary account maintained by CrescoFin at UBS in Switzerland.[5]

This account is tokenized to reflect the insured real-world collateral, via the creation of the iCRES tokens. The iCRES tokens are 1:1 matched against the purchase price of the invoices (the asset collateral), in units of $1. 
As additional insured collateral is added to the account, additional Tokens are minted (and offered for sale to investors).
Investors pay in USDC and purchase newly minted iCRES tokens, representing the insured collateral. The iCRES tokens pay a 3.00% rate of interest, received daily in new iCRES tokens. 
Investors may trade the iCRES tokens in the market. In traditional finance, the price varies inversely to the yield (interest rate) desired.  So, if investors would accept a lower interest rate than 3.00% for insured collateral, the price of the tokens would rise.  If they wanted a higher rate, the price of the tokens would fall.
If an investor wishes to withdraw USDC, the iCRES tokens are burned and the investor is repaid in USDC.
The iCRES tokens have been optimized for low gas cost trading and are interoperable with other ERC20 tokens.
The iCRES tokens can only be exchanged with addresses that have been approved by CrescoFin and are specified in the on-chain registry.
Once an address is included in the registry they can participate in any regulated product.
Effectively, the iCRES tokens provide an insured interest rate to investors. However, legally, investors are purchasing tokens that represent invoices acquired at a discount.  The invoices are expected to be repaid at a higher value (if not, insurance pays), which is equivalent to an interest rate.  This is reflected by a distribution of additional iCRES tokens to investors.  As there is no capital gains tax in Switzerland, the full proceeds are conveyed to investors without any deduction for tax.[6]

Tokens
The Tokens represent a simple claim on insured assets.  The key economic features are set out below.

The investor will receive daily interest in the form of additional iCRES tokens.
CrescoFin will use the borrowed USDC to invest in additional regulated insured assets, denominated in USD in the real world, thereby continuously adding new insured collateral to the account.
New iCRES tokens will be minted on a 1:1 basis with new insured collateral entering the account and sold to investors.
When investors wish to convert back to USDC, iCRES tokens are burned.

We believe that this unique Aave funding mechanism will encourage adoption of real-world assets coming into the DeFi ecosystem, in a low-risk and regulated manner.  It is also likely to attract significant institutional interest in Aave.    
The Tokens are regulated assets[7] and have compliance feature built into them that use the C-Layer Standard, an audited, open-source compliance software under MIT License.  This has the following implications:

Potential investors must undergo a simple, common-sense KYC process with CrescoFin, under Swiss law. This is explained below. 
CrescoFin has a simple acceptance policy: if you are on a sanctions list by the Swiss government, then you will not be approved. If you are not on this sanctions list, then you will be approved.  CrescoFin has no arbitrary power to include/exclude anyone. 
Approved users will have their on-chain address included in an anonymous on-chain registry. Personal KYC data is protected by strict Swiss privacy laws and is stored by CrescoFin in Switzerland in a computer that is not connected to the internet. 
In the (unlikely) event of an insurance claim, having the investor’s details will allow them to benefit from the insurance cover, in their own name.

The KYC process
The KYC process is simple and common-sense and corresponds to Swiss law.

A tokenholder contacts CrescoFin (community@crescofin.ch) indicating that they wish to be approved to purchase the iCRES tokens. They need to provide their name, address and a photo ID. For the photo ID, this will be confirmed in a video call with CrescoFin; instructions will be communicated to tokenholders. Do not send your photo ID via email.
To prove that they control the Ethereum address, CrescoFin will ask the tokenholder to send them a message that is hashed with their private key. Instructions will be sent to the tokenholder after they contact CrescoFin requesting to be registered. CrescoFin will never ask for your private key.
CrescoFin checks that the tokenholder is not on a Swiss government sanctions list. If they are, then they will not be allowed to register. If no, then they will be registered.
An anonymous registry of approved addresses is maintained on-chain by CrescoFin. 
The database of registered users is maintained by CrescoFin at our headquarters in Switzerland, in an off-line computer. 
Once users/addresses are approved and included in the on-chain registry, they are automatically authorized to purchase the iCRES tokens. The iCRES tokens can be exchanged with any other Ethereum address that is included in the approved registry.   
Registered addresses are also automatically eligible to invest in other regulated money markets on Aave that may be developed in the future, if they wish. 

Oracle
CrescoFin is working with Chainlink to provide proof of reserves to investors on-chain. This guarantees that the 1:1 matching of 1 iCRES token to $1 of insured collateral assets in the real world, for additional investor security. 
Chainlink will also provide on-chain information to verify that all of the collateral for the iCRES tokens is fully insured. 
ISIN Securities Codes
The products set out in this Proposal have been awarded securities codes by the International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) Organization.  In traditional finance, ISINs provide a unique identifier for a security and its structure is defined by ISO 6166.  The ISIN code is a 12-character alpha-numerical code.  Typically, asset managers are legally (or by the regulator) required to invest client money only in financial products that have an ISIN code, which means that DeFi products are off-limits to many traditional investors.  CrescoFin is the first DeFi company to have its products awarded an ISIN code and are also the first to have DeFi products quoted on the Bloomberg terminal, which is the standard reference in traditional finance.  Details of the products are set out below.

Investor protections

The Tokens are protected by Swiss law.
The Tokens’ expected cashflows are backed by real-world assets that are fully insured.
The issuer is regulated and audited in Switzerland.

Some firsts

First regulated money market in DeFi.
First insured collateral in DeFi.
First simple KYC mechanism for composability in DeFi.

Future opportunities
As CrescoFin is a regulated company and its real-world collateral is insured, starting a relationship with them may lead to other opportunities for the Aave community in the future, such as developing the undercollateralized lending product. 
There is also the possibility to add a time element to the money market, where higher returns are paid on investor funds locked up for longer periods (e.g. 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months).  This could lead to the creation of a yield curve in crypto.

['Creating a market for insured real-world assets and bringing institutional investors to Aave'],"I’m a an experienced compliance professional and I have some serious concerns about your KYC process.
You say “Potential investors must undergo a simple, common-sense KYC process” then indicate that if an applicant is listed under “a sanctions list by the Swiss government”  it won’t be registered but you also mention that you also operate in USD, EUR and CHF and planning to introduce USDC as a stablecoin offering. Just by using these currencies you should screen your clients against European and American sanctions list but you are not doing that.
My concern here is that you are proposing to be a bridge between traditional finance and Aave but your lax KYC process may adversely put all Aave community at risk. Remember that USDC is backed by USD
I personally would like to have more details about your KYC process and the reasons why you are not including American or European lists into your process. Also, are you screening the applicants institution’s Ultimate Beneficiary Owners?
To the Aave community - we need to carefully ask ourselves if we are comfortable with the risk being introduced by traditional finance institution’s. In DeFi we are still not under strict regulations but one of the layers of protection we have in regards to inflow is that  VASPs are required to perform KYC, therefore, to avoid risk, we need to better understand their KYC process
I’m not saying I’m not in favour of this proposal yet. Any integration with traditional finance will benefit us all but we need to understand the risks involved",56,76.2,2020-11-18
['Creating a market for insured real-world assets and bringing institutional investors to Aave'],"Thanks for engaging the Aave community. I am curious of how 1) Aave holders will benefit 2) how do you come up with 3%
Please provide more transparency to how you price as most defi folks are risk takers and have greater appetite than traditional finance returns.",54,60.8,2020-11-18
['Creating a market for insured real-world assets and bringing institutional investors to Aave'],"Hi @Nando, thanks for your comment.  That is great that you are into compliance like us; what is your background?
What is being proposed here are not currencies. We are proposing to contribute insured collateral to a new market on Aave.  Anything that takes real world assets and puts them into a financial structure is a regulated activity.  Some in crypto seem to ignore this, but we are a regulated financial institution and we are authorized to create these products and to undertake KYC.
For potential Aave investors to participate in the money market they need to have compliant addresses and this is part of our proposal.  As the product and collateral are from us, we would do this KYC process in accordance with Swiss laws and regulation.  Swiss law is quite clear about crypto and KYC, unlike other jurisdictions.  It is also supportive of crypto, which is nice.
We seek to be permissioned, but not arbitrary.  Potential investors don’t need to provide any excess personal details, or prove a certain level of wealth, etc.  Banks can decide if they want you as a customer or not, but we don’t operate like that.  We follow Swiss law very carefully and if you are on a sanctions list from the Swiss government, we cannot accept you.  If not, we do accept you.
You seem to suggest that we should go beyond our legal requirements and also check other sanctions lists, like from the United States.  If the Aave community wants us to do that, we can do that.  The Swiss lists also include UN lists and there is significant overlap.  EU lists are also typically incorporated into Swiss sanctions.  Our preference is to simply follow the law here in Switzerland and not apply American law.  However, if the Aave community wants this we can do it.
We have our own in-house legal and compliance people.  We are regulated and audited here in Switzerland.  We place our insurance with the Lloyd’s market, who do DD on us, our bank is UBS.  Our clients are mainly financial institutions or family offices.  Of course we check UBO details for institutions.  We certainly exceed the standards of VASPS, many of whom only have basic compliance status.  We are a fully regulated firm.
I appreciate that you find the approach to be “lax” as it just does what is legally required for financial institutions here in Switzerland.  If the Aave community wants greater KYC than the approach we have in Switzerland we can consider that.",57,61.4,2020-11-18

Investors in the Aave money market would get an insured return of 3%.  This is designed to be comparable to a bank account.  Aave holders would benefit from fees paid, like in other Aave markets. We hope to be able to bring our institutions to Aave, as well.


To generate the return, we purchase invoices to be paid by investment-grade companies in the real world.  The services provided to the Buyer by the Seller are recorded on-chain. This removes the possibility of disputes between the parties. CrescoFin only finances (purchases) invoices in respect of which the Buyer agrees to pay, at a later date (usually from 7- 30 days).

['Collateral Swaps & Paying Loans with Other Tokens'],"A couple ideas I’d like to throw out:

The ability to swap collateral within Aave protocol.



Think: Uniswap for collateral within Aave


Use case:


a) You deposit $ETH as collateral - $ETH starts dumping - you swap to $DAI to preserve value
or
b) You deposit $DAI as collateral - $ETH starts pumping - you swap to $ETH for collateral gains
** Maybe it could be done using Metamask, now that they have enabled swaps?


The ability to pay off loans with a different token to that which was borrowed


The ability to pay off loan with collateral - either same token as borrowed or other


Would love to hear some feedback on these from you guys.
Have these ideas already been considered and dismissed for some reason?
I’ve not gone too deep into considering arbitrage opportunities or problems in supply/demand that may arise if implemented, so please do point these out to me in the comments.

['Privacy for AAVE and aTokens'],"Hello Aave community,
Would you be interested in transactional privacy for your AAVE or aTokens?
At Secret Network we are building a privacy preserving smart contracting platform and bringing privacy to Ethereum assets through the bridge we built between Ethereum and Secret Network. The bridge is expected to go on mainnet on December 14, 2020.
Adding AAVE (and aTokens) to the bridge, will enable holders to create wrapped AAVE with privacy, which we would call secretAAVE. This is similar to an ERC20 on our network, yet since contracts are encrypted tokens issued with contracts are privacy tokens. secretTokens are already live on Secret Network
Holders of secretAAVE (or secret_aTokens) can:

privately transact (like zCash) secretAAVE on Secret Network
redeem secretAAVE to a new ETH address to achieve transactional privacy on ETH, which is similar to Tornado Cash (at ~30% of Tornado’s cost)
participate in a front-running resistant AMM, which is expected to go live in early 2021

We are here to get feedback on whether this is interesting for the AAVE community and contribute. We are big fans of what you are building.
If there’s any interest, we’d be happy to go ahead with this technical integration that will bring privacy to AAVE and aTokens. Would really appreciate thoughts and comments!",28,140.6,2020-12-03
['Proposal: Add Support for ibETH'],"Hi All,
The Alpha Homora projects lends ETH to yield farmers and uses their LP tokens collateral to secure the loan. The interest bearing form of that ETH is referred to as ibETH. Because yield farming is so profitable right now the farmers are willing to pay above average APY for ETH. Much higher than on AAVE or Compound (currently 7.5%).
Right now there is an arbitrage opportunity for investors to borrow ETH from AAVE and invest it into ibETH and earn the spread. However, since ibETH isn’t a collateral type at AAVE this bridge between the platforms is quite limited. However, if ibETH was accepted as a collateral type on AAVE investors could leverage this trade and cause the interest rates between the two platforms to converge. This would give AAVE investors a better interest rate by connecting them with the yield farmers at Alpha Homora. It would also grow the TVL for AAVE.
Any thoughts on this?
Thank you!",34,461.8,2020-12-02

['Proposal: Add Support for DMG'],"I’m Corey, co-founder of DeFi Money Market (DMM).
Our team would like to add DMG as a collateral asset and currency. In addition, we think offering the opportunity to stack yield with DMM’s stable interest mTokens (6.25%) with AAVE’s aTokens could lead to some interesting arbitrage in the DeFi ecosystem.
Why aDMG and amTokens?
DMG and its corresponding mTokens are adding diversification to the DeFi industry by bringing stable and uncorrelated yield in a trust-minimized manner. Our interest-earning protocol is built similar to Compound and AAVE, with the major distinction being that underlying interest payments are made by off-chain service providers whose responsibility is to manage a pool of assets that is being lent.
The DMG token is a fork of COMP, with a couple minor tweaks like a native burn function and more off-chain signature-based functions (like permitting and transferring). The ecosystem is governed by contracts that are controlled by DMG holders. We have moderate liquidity on Uniswap and are in the process of expanding it by leveraging our self-made yield farming / liquidity mining program.
As noted in the proposal for adding AMPL, adding DMG and mTokens to AAVE would enable ecosystem participants to:

Utilize a new, low-correlated collateral asset which could reduce risk (for mTokens)
Allow users to stack the yield that is offered by DMM’s mTokens and AAVE’s aTokens
Create leveraged DMG and mTokens trades and unlock decentralized derivatives
Create interest bearing DMG, which can be staked in other protocols
Increase exposure to DMG & farming

The combination of our ecosystem’s unique features that expand DeFi’s use-cases to real-world assets and our community should lead to lively market participants from both the DMM & AAVE communities. We envision more collaborations being possible in the future as we roll out decentralized asset introducers via NFTs, expand our yield farming tokens and use-cases, and further upgrade our ecosystem.

Edit: Our BD team went back to a number of questions that surfaced on places like the Maker DAO post and within our community. Most of them were already answered via a FAQ on our Medium. For convenience sake, we merged new questions and content from this Medium post to the governance forum, here.
In your explorer, a value is listed for each underlying asset. It looks like this is the value of the loan, not the vehicle value. Is this correct?

Yes, the value shown in the DMM Explorer represents the loan value. Keep in mind, the vehicles in these liens are already at the end of the depreciation curve, which is why the value does not fluctuate.

What sort of loan to value ratios do you allow into your underlying loan portfolio? What sort of credit and income underwriting requirements? What is the weighted average interest rate, FICO, DTI, and LTV of the portfolio of underlying assets? If you can point me to any further resources where this information is available that would be appreciated.

Every asset is evaluated differently and requires an unique examination as to the relevant underwriting criteria. The core basis for this ecosystem is asset-backed lending and we have designed proprietary underwriting criteria based on specific assets and geographic locations. While there is risk surrounding the assets that back the system, the general nature of DMM - the overcollateralization of both the assets backing DMM and the income streams provided - are in place to protect the overall DMM Ecosystem. There have been sufficient steps taken to mitigate risk by keeping the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio well below industry averages. This means that any repossessed assets when sold should recover the principal, plus interest. Additionally, the vehicle-based loan business has typically seen minimal instances of repossession with significant recovery of the loan’s principal. To further diversify risk, these loans are distributed across geographic regions in the US and frequently have thousands of borrowers coming in and out of loans. This diversifies risk away from only having a few underlying loans back the system and guarantees fresh liquidity flowing in and out of the ecosystem.

Do you originate the loans yourself, or service and collect on the loans? If not your organization, how is this managed? How do you mitigate the risk of loan contracts being invalidated due to violations of US consumer lending regulations?

No, the loans are originated by a third-party company. We are listed as a lienholder but collecting payments and managing the entirety of the loan aspects are handled by another company. All loans are done in accordance with regulations depending on the jurisdiction of where the tokenized real-world assets are in.

Auto loans are a fundamentally illiquid asset. How would you be able to meet large redemption requests on short notice if most of your funds are invested in loans?


The initial backing of DMM is a pool of vehicles (cars, trucks, etc.) located in the United States of America. The reason we chose this as the first asset class is because the core team has deep domain experience spanning several decades in this space, generating income production of between 15% - 20% return over the last 5 years. Additionally, this asset class has several other substantial benefits as a backing for DMM when compared to other real-world assets. Some of these benefits include:

76.3% of U.S. workers use a personal vehicle to commute to work.
Historical trends show consumers pay for vehicles before their real estate or rent.
Vehicles are one of the most liquid asset classes in the world – there are 2x weekly auctions in every major city where they can be sold for cash on the spot.
Unlike real estate, there is no long foreclosure process – in the event of lack of payment.
Rather, the asset can be recovered without additional legal action.
The asset can be transported for nominal fees to maximize resale value.
Risk is diversified amongst many individual investments and geographies.
Shorter term (average one year) provides for greater liquidity.
The average car age is 5 -9 years old, meaning the majority of the depreciation has
already occurred. Vehicles depreciate 10% - 30% in the first few years of ownership and then depreciation slows substantially. Additionally, the loans are shorter term, so it is unlikely the vehicle will depreciate markedly during the loan’s 1-year term.
All borrowers must complete and provide income verification and prove the ability to repay.
In most states, in the event a party is not up-to-date on their vehicle payments, a registration hold can be placed on the vehicle. As a result, their license plate cannot be renewed until the owed sums are paid. This prohibits them from legally driving the vehicle until the owed sums are paid in full.



DMM allegedly owns liens on used vehicles in the US (although proper proof has not been provided to the public)


You can view all of our real-world overcollateralized assets in our DMM Explorer.


As we continue to add more assets more information and documentation will become available. The DMM Foundation is working in conjunction with its selected and to-be selected global 3rd party platform servicers to establish a first-ever verification blueprint that will periodically act as a secondary confirmation that the DMM Foundation has the necessary contractual rights to the real-world assets represented in the explorer, as previously verified by the servicers.


As we believe this is the first time this undertaking has been deployed, the DMM Foundation is actively working with its servicers to develop a standardized protocol that is real-world asset agnostic for secondary confirmation by an unrelated, independent and specialized third-party (to be clear, this third-party is a secondary confirmation and different from the verification performed by the servicers). While the development and establishment of this protocol is being finalized, the DMM Foundation will be conducting a request for quotation amongst different global providers in the legal, rating and business advisory services with a specific decentralized finance focus and implementation.


Additionally, our team is growing as we continue to add seasoned professionals such as our new Finance Consultant hire who has 9+ years of experience in auditing and assurance services for trade, manufacturing and service companies such as Deloitte.


DMM converts the crypto to USD which is allegedly used solely to service the used car loans, and repurchases the crypto when the user/depositor wants to redeem their mTokens (supposedly on demand)

The DMM Ecosystem needs to maintain a reserve ratio (which is preserved via on-chain integrity) to prevent a “run on the bank” and ensure that users are able to seamlessly move in and out of the ecosystem. As of right now, the DMMF has moved small amounts of the assets sitting in the smart contracts into fiat. All of the other interest has been paid out by liens already owned by the DMMF, not funds drawn down from the mToken pool.

['Tips for borrowing safely on Aave'],"Loans in DeFi lending and borrowing are overcollateralized, meaning that in order to borrow one asset, you need to put up more in value of another asset as collateral to ensure you won’t default on your loan. If the value of your collateral falls, or the value of your loan increases, your collateral can get liquidated.
Therefore, it’s important to make sure you always have enough collateral to support your loan position. If your collateral drops in value or the value of your loan increases, you can deposit more into the protocol to be used as collateral. One thing to monitor is your Health Factor-- it’s important to keep your HF above 1 or you risk being liquidated.
There are some cool tools that are useful to track your loans position so you don’t get liquidated, such as HAL or DeFi Saver. HAL lets you track and receive notifications about your HF. DeFi Saver lets you auto-liquidate your loan.",31,471.2,2020-11-26

For example, if a user has deposited DAI and lots of people want to borrow DAI, but the deposited supply is quite low, then the interest rates for DAI depositors will increase to attract more deposits. On the other hand, if nobody wants to borrow DAI and the DAI supply is high, then the interest rates will be lower.
Depositors can see the Annual Percentage Yield (APY) that they will earn on their deposits in the Aave DApp. APY is the yield/interest after a year, which includes compounding interest. This is different from Annual Percentage Rate (APR) which does not take into account compounding effects. The APY is subject to change according to supply and demand, but the DApp also gives a past 30 day average to give you a broader view.",29,1515.8,2020-11-26
['Proposal to stop the LEND burning and start building an AAVE governance treasury'],"Aave V1 included the possibility to burn LEND tokens by collecting flashloan premiums and borrowing fees. Up until now, 2.3M LEND have been burned, which will not be converted to AAVE.
As a result of the migration, the LEND liquidity has shrunk considerably, which makes it very hard to buy LEND on dexes for the burning.
The LEND burner currently holds around 50K of funds, distributed across all the different Aave V1 reserves (mostly stablecoins). The burner contract is here https://etherscan.io/address/0xe3d9988f676457123c5fd01297605efdd0cba1ae
My proposal is the following:

Stop the LEND burning by deploying a new version of the migrator. The migrator would instead:


Convert all the non stablecoins to stablecoin (EG DAI)
Move the funds to the AAVE reserve contract (0x25f2226b597e8f9514b3f68f00f494cf4f286491), the AAVE contract that currently holds the AAVE incentives.

Optional:
Deposit the AAVE treasury in the protocol itself and hold the treasury in the form of aTokens. With that, the following is achieved:

More yield is generated from the interest paid by borrowers
The aTokens interest can be used for different pourposes through the interest redirection
With V2 and credit delegation, the governance will be able to borrow from the protol against the treasury, which brings some interesting use cases like

Providing grants to the community without depleting the governance treasury
Allowing borrowing to yield strategies that might use the borrowed assets to yield farm

In the original tokenomics, LEND must be bought from the market to burn. Over time this reduces token supply, hence increasing the Token value.
Now LEND is AAVE. So why now buy AAVE from the market to burn them.
The whole tokenomics was dependent on the token supply deflation.
Now - 1 we increased the token supply around 25% (Printing money out of thin air on the expense or other holders ).
2- And you are proposing removing the most valuable tokenomics gem, burning the token.
I hold AAVE and strictly oppose any option against the initial tokenomics of “Buring the token”.

['Proposal to stop the LEND burning and start building an AAVE governance treasury'],"My first response here is I don’t think token burning is obsolete at all.  We can see EIP 1559 moving towards token burning.  Filecoin has adopted it and there are researchers who think there may well be multiple protocols (both PoS and PoW) may adopt some variant of what EIP 1559 is doing in the future.
Quite frankly, to claim token burning is obsolete is a misreading of the entire space (respectfully IMO).
@Emilio I will go through your links on the weekend as I do want to understand your arguments at a deeper level and see whether you have superior points.  I will say I am somewhat uncomfortable with the ease with which this idea is being circulated here currently.
I believe token burning is an important tool within tokenomics and will continue to be in the future (again consider EIP 1559).  Considering AAVE has just increased token supply considerably and is now asking Stakers to take on considerable risk just to win that inflationary subsidy, I am NOT satisfied with the idea of easily ditching the existing function of token burn to give Treasury even more funds.",90,58.0,2020-10-28

Which means that, in my - and other researchers - opinion, it is possible to do better. Of course for other use cases it might work well. Ethereum has no governance, and given the network structure and the way it works, burning looks like the obvious way to go. Certainly some form of value accrual (in the case of ETH, burning) is better than no value accrual mechanism at all as the current network configuration.
With a tangible treasury under management (besides the control of the protocol itself) many possibilities unlock for AAVE that are beyond a slow decrease of the total supply. Including, for example, direct value redistribution to the token holders.",81,91.2,2020-10-28

On the fees or any revenues from the treasury, I would consider multiple aspects:
Why not splitting like XX% back to AAVE stakers as a claim. (a la SNX)
Having an other XX% on an aDAI fund to protect from hacks (an other security layer on top of the security mech to avoid taking loved AAVE from AAVE fam stakers).
Having an other XX% to pay for insurance on a mutual (Financed by all defi protocol to cover in case of non-systemic hack). (What an other layer of protection???)
Having XX% for a sort of venture branch, investing in early projects benefiting to AAVE ecosystem or AAVE ethos. ( And if those generate revenues, those would be added to this whole loop.)
Having an other XX% to invest in Governance Tokens to be able to cast vote and have an AAVE voice in other protocols.  (And if those generate revenues, those would be added to this whole loop.)

['Proposal to stop the LEND burning and start building an AAVE governance treasury'],"I definitely agree that burning tokens does not make sense in most of economical designs. You are in theory paying to burn money without getting any utility in return whereas taking the amount of capital and re-investing or recapitalising would mean that you would be able to use that capital to a) yield more capital and redistribute to various stakeholders as @Sunshine pointed out or you could actually use that capital by incentivising stakeholders for various actions such as building more infrastructure and functionality to expand the protocol.
Practically using funds to increase demand for the protocol, any demand for the protocol will increase the TVL and that increases the Safety Module coverage, which means that the incentives of SM would be priced higher to cover increasing demand, these increased pricing on incentives could actually mean that there could be more demand for AAVE to cover the demand. It’s a positive value loop.
Interesting compromise can also be the option where the funds are converted to aTokens and deposited to Aave Protocol to increase liquidity and kept there for fixed time-lock, which could be long enough, for example x % of the funds could be unlocked after 12-36 months and used to incentivise stakeholders or fund development teams.

['Proposal to stop the LEND burning and start building an AAVE governance treasury'],"I definitely agree with what’s said here, thank you for bringing it up.
The possibilities for the treasury are really exciting. For instance, as @Emilio pointed out, if the treasury holds aTokens (like aDAI instead of just DAI), we can actually vote to redirect a portion of that interest to new projects, core AAVE devs/team members, and more, sort of like a “salary.”
Furthermore, as more ways for the treasury to accrue value are built (redirecting a portion of interest/greater origination fees/etc), we can, and I believe should, pay out SM stakers in the corresponding aToken, aDAI in this example.
This is a neat model because by default, rewarding stakers with aTokens doesn’t actually remove any liquidity from the protocol, and the individual stakers would accrue interest as well. It would be up to the staker to redeem their aTokens manually.
Another option is to redirect a portion of the treasury’s interest to a “distributor” contract that distributes that given interest to stakers instead of directly distributing the earned aTokens. Thus, as the treasury grows, so too do the stakers’ incentives. I’m not too familiar on the feasibility of a system like this, but I’m sure it’s possible.

This is a really cool proposition, can’t wait to vote yes for this :D
As mentioned above, there is so much that can be done with a tresaury.
One part of the proposition we made with @EmmanuelD also cover this topic :
The idea of the treasury is to get a DAO growing fund in addition to the ecosystem reserve. The first fees generated will start generate interests with a farming strategy allowing the DAO to compound interests earned in order to fill the treasury faster.

Incentivize Devs building up on top of Aave
Incentivize Non Devs community members
Additional Safety in case of short fall event
Additional Incentive for stakers
Create a DAO farming fund with credit delegation

As the funds will rise every time with compounding, the interest could be used like this:

some interests used to buy AAVE and send it to stakers, creating a bullish pressure on the price
some interests compounded to always raise treasury
*some interests for stakers so they could receive stablecoins or even atokens for exemple, which would increase HF’s stakers.

Regarding the burn, i also think it’s not the most efficient solution, as we are able to use value in $AAVE as a collateral, in a farming strategy or else, and i would be glad that remaining $Lend be used to start a DAO fund that would increase over time.",71,104.2,2020-11-02

## AIP rationale

The Aave protocol V1 included the possibility to burn LEND tokens by collecting flashloan premiums and borrowing fees. Up until now, 2.5M LEND have been burned, which will not be converted to AAVE.
As a result of the migration, the LEND liquidity has shrunk considerably, which makes it very hard to buy LEND on dexes for the burning.

The LEND burner currently holds around 20K of funds, distributed across all the different Aave V1 reserves (mostly stablecoins). The burner contract is here https://etherscan.io/address/0xe3d9988f676457123c5fd01297605efdd0cba1ae 

This AIP proposes to stop the LEND burning. Instead, the idea is to collect the value accrued by AAVE V1 to bootstrap a protocol treasury. 

## AIP content in short


  This file has been truncated. show original





The idea is to keep to implementation as simple as possible. So the assets collected will simply be deposited in the protocol to obtain aTokens, and afterwards moved to the AAVE reserve contract.
I think there is time for subsequent AIPs to evaluate what’s the best reinvestment strategy for the treasury for the sake of the AAVE ecosystem.",70,569.0,2020-11-05

['Proposal: Add Support For Regulated Canadian Mortgages'],"At TokenFunder, we are excited to see Aave V2 launching, and even more excited to propose adding Canadian mortgages onto Aave. This would be the first step of bringing many more assets in the credit market to Aave the money market protocol.
We will explain our considerations and the nature of the proposed assets, so members of the community can have a reasonable understanding of risks.
Motivation
We believe integration with real-world credit market assets is the future direction of DeFi.
As much as we’d like to see everything decentralized, when it comes to asset origination in the real world, there is no way of getting around securities regulation, lawyers, and accountants in the foreseeable future. We can, however, introduce regulated assets onto DeFi, and there are several ways it can greatly benefit Aave:

In terms of dollar amount, the credit market dwarfs other financial markets, and makes the current DeFi volume look like a rounding error. Onboarding these assets has the potential to grow Aave market size.
As the saying goes, diversification is the only free lunch in investing. Credit markets offer many uncorrelated asset types, including residential mortgages. This would allow Aave investors to maintain their return at a lower risk.
With a larger selection of diversified assets, Aave can gradually attract more investors groups, including ones that are not crypto-native.

Our regulatory background
TokenFunder is the first and only registered Exempt Market Dealer (similar to US broker-dealer) in Canada that is officially approved to issue tokenized securities.
We started our journey in 2017 with Canada’s first regulated token offering. We obtained approval for issuing general security tokens in 2019, and have set multiple regulatory milestones towards Canada’s first private market trading platform.
We perform careful due-diligence on all asset issuers. All issuers are audited; all asset issuances are registered at appropriate Canadian securities commissions; and all assets are issued pursuant to Offering Memorandums.
Criteria for asset selection
The credit market is huge and we need to pick a good beachhead asset. Such asset should meet the following criteria:

easy to understand and evaluate
price is well-defined and stable
has a good risk-adjusted return
can be readily converted into cash via liquidity or redemptions
has incentives to onboard DeFi services

This set of criteria returns out to favor credit assets with good cash flow in the private market, as most public assets either have poor real returns or have no incentives to be on-boarded onto DeFi. Private assets, on the other hand, can be great fits as they tend to offer better returns, and being limited to the private market, they see obvious benefits to on-board DeFi.
There are large groups of private market assets that meet criteria 1, 2, 3, and 5. Criteria 4 is most challenging as liquidity in the private market is extremely limited. Availability for cash redemption becomes crucial, and this is where we find Canadian mortgage investment corporations shine.
Mortgage Investment Corporations are a great beachhead
Mortgage Investment Corporations (MIC) are specially-regulated entities in Canada that pool investors’ funds across a wide array of mortgages, each participant owns a share of the entire pool of mortgages, so risk is spread across all pool participants.
They typically focus on small secondary mortgages that are $100K in size, and 6-month - 2-year in duration. Most MICs have hundreds of small mortgages and are constantly turning them over. Their cash flow is ample enough to accommodate for redemptions at all times. Additionally, they usually have plenty of cash reserves. This is a unique trait that few private market assets have.
Being flow-through entities, MICs receive special tax treatment. They do not pay any income tax, and must forward 100% of profits to its participants. The mortgages offered are always secured against the title, i.e. they have claim to the underlying property in case of a default.
Most private MICs yield a targeted return of 8-10% per year. This level of return has been consistent, and even through the Covid period. This of course cannot compare to the 20% - 1000% APY that yield farming generates, but MICs do offer a stable and predictable source of income for years to come that is uncorrelated to crypto assets.
Private MIC offerings are registered with corresponding securities commissions, and must produce audited financial reports annually. Their share prices are usually fixed, e.g. $1 CAD per share. New money invested into a MIC results in new shares being minted, and the mortgage pool growing larger.
Focus on residential mortgages
When talking about real-world investments, we cannot ignore the elephant in the room - Covid 19. While lock-down measures have damned commercial properties and construction loans, residential properties have actually performed extremely well. MICs we work with that are residential-focused have seen few payment deferrals (<5%), a rate better than major banks. They have not needed to decrease payouts, or paused redemptions, during the worst days of Covid 19.
While talking to members of the DeFi community, we found a few had the misconception that this is similar to the CDOs of 2008. Hopefully the explanation above clarifies that, MICs in the most basic terms, are a group of investors pooling funds together to invest in a large number of small mortgages. No packaging, selling of mortgages, or any financial engineering occur. A MIC share is not identified as a mortgage-backed security.
Reflecting on 2008, residential properties in Canada were not heavily impacted in Canada as they were in the US. Unlike MICs with exposure to commercial properties and development loans, residential MICs were not expected to lose capital.
Another force favoring residential mortgages is the immigration policy. Canada has long been a leading immigration destination. Canada is currently targeting over 400,000 new immigrants each year with a 37.6 million total population, promising strong demand for residential properties and mortgages. Meanwhile, major Canadian regions have enacted hefty (15-20%) foreign buyer taxes on properties since 2017 to curtail unhealthy speculation.
On-boarding Aave

We propose to introduce pools for tokenized MIC shares on the Aave public market. As explained above, each share represents legal ownership over a portion of the entire mortgage pool. A pool will be created for each MIC being on-boarded. Aave community members can lend against these shares. This can decrease Aave’s overall lending risk by diversifying into uncorrelated assets.
The pools will be governed by Aave community members. We will propose parameters for each asset, and the community has the final say.
Private MIC share prices are generally fixed in Canadian dollars. We can set up a CAD price feed for each MIC. The price is never expected to change unless a major event takes place. In such an event, we being the dealer will carry the responsibility of updating the price feed.
We expect the CAD exchange rate to be the primary source of fluctuations. The USD/CAD rate is generally stable, a 20% swing takes years to develop. For a 100% residential MIC with $10M AUM, we might propose 60% TLV, 75% liquidation threshold, and 20% liquidation bonus.
Currently there is a lack of reliable CAD exchange rate data source. We are actively discussing with Chainlink on building the CAD oracle network. If this proposal goes forward, the exact oracle solution will be part of the final AIP.
How assets can be liquidated
The share prices of private Mortgage Investment Corporations are stable, therefore liquidations are expected to be rare events. In the event of a liquidation, the liquidator will take possession of the shares, which can be redeemed for cash.
Most MICs are step up for flexible redemption options, i.e. typically an investor can request redemption of shares at any time. The request may take one to several business days to be processed, depending on the dollar amount involved. These redemptions often carry a penalty, e.g. 5%, hence we propose a high liquidation bonus (20%) to ensure liquidators are well-compensated after taking the redemption penalty.
In order to request redemptions, we will set up a redemption contract for each asset. Liquidators can：

Lock their shares into the redemption contract, which through an off-chain polling system will forward the redemption request to the MIC.
The MIC will come up with the cash required.
In the fulfillment transaction, dollar amounts in Dai according to the share price oracle are transferred to the liquidator while the shares are burned.

If the liquidator wishes to hold onto the shares to receive dividend payouts, or transfer them elsewhere, they must pass KYC/AML on the TokenFunder platform to be whitelisted. Launching a redemption request with liquidated shares is the only exception that does not require whitelisting.
Feedback wanted
First and the foremost, we’d love to understand if this is something the community wants. Please let us know if you might want lending exposure to real-world credit market assets, like Canadian residential mortgages.

['Here is why AAVE will fall and we should abandon it. I will make sure of if'],"Thanks TheDoo.
My private keys are not compromised. Just before I visited AAVE.com, I had more than 500eths and not taken. After staking AAVE, I did not do any other transactions and no ways to be compromised. Because I move eth-lend from sushiswap and converted lend to aave and then staked. So the 470 ethers were sitting in the wallet and safe. Means even at that time no one can take my eth. But after staken aave and trying unstaking, eth and stkAAVE are taken and other 7m staked in other defi such as harvest eth etc were safe.
Now I have moved fund to a new cold wallet.
As my AAVE were staked at AAVE.com and I was not able to withdraw, it makes AAVE is responsible for the fund’s safty, especially when AAVE is able to secure it. As your term deposit in a bank, you lose your card and ask the bank to freeze the account.
Even with a decentralized  system, there are different permission levels for different actions(functions), it is in the code. Further, in the governance page it says:“The cooldown period by default is 10 days, but this can be further extended by the governance.” Therefore extending cooldown is not against code and not a function that needs a vote. It is a security issue that needs immediate action. Not a issue of DAO.
Or, would you give any proof that extending cooldown need a DAO?
Even everything you said are right, then AAVE‘s system is not working. Pleasse understand I am not attacking decentralized sysytem. I am attacking AAVE. A good thing can be bad when it is used by bad person just as a gun can be used by murderers. AAVE facilitates crimes purposely against social common sense. When it has committed such crime, that must be destroyed. You can have your argument about this, but let it be decided by the jury.
Like recent Pickle attack, please learn more about it. There are many functions especially the functions regarding security, need to be executed immediately and they did, without any vote. And you look at AAVE’s voting page, so far there is only one executed vote. Does it really use the voting to do business?  I am ok if we can have a vote on this. But when I tried to create a vote, it has error. I asked there develop team. They said it is a known issue. That is, even the voting system is not working or has been shutdown.
I think what I am doing is very productive and very needed by the society, to protect invester’s (including your) money. Can you ensure there will be no further hacking on AAVE? Perhaps your wallet is already under AAVE’s control and they are just waiting for the right target and right time to get it(when you try to withdraw and enter the cooldown period just as I did).",88,47.6,2020-11-23

This one for example

Can you prove, with absolute certainty, that you don’t have the keys of 0xD7C40C252cAEBfeA30A02cDC648Bf5CF8Cb690e1? Can you prove that this whole smearing campaign you started here is not a mere attempt to discredit Aave for your own profit?
Let me guess: you can’t, BECAUSE THE TRANSACTIONS STARTED FROM YOUR OWN WALLET.
So there isn’t even a way to really demonstrate that this was a hack. And you expect the community will mess up the whole Aave governance process and the ecosystem just because you are claiming you got hacked.
This alone should make you understand that there is no way a governance vote like the one you asked would pass. I don’t think even centralized exchanges would ever lock the funds you are claiming were stolen based on the data you provided.
To answer your point n 5, IF there is a hack like the one of pickle (don’t even compare the hack you suffered with that one - they are on a completely different level, technically speaking) then yes, the governance will need to decide how to move forward. The Aave ecosystem has a series of safety guards in place (like the safety module where you originally staked) to compensate the system for the loss. It requires a governance process to be activated.",74,84.8,2020-11-23

['Proposal: Add support for CRV (Curve DAO Token)'],"Summary:
Proposal by the Curve team
Curve  is an exchange liquidity pool on Ethereum designed for extremely efficient stablecoin trading. It is the second biggest DEX on Ethereum and the third biggest protocol by TVL.
The newly launched CRV token is a governance token which also allows liquidity providers to boost their rewards on the platform as well as receive a share of trading fees on the Curve platform. Curve has recently reached over $10B in cumulative volume.
Users who vote lock their tokens (CRV => veCRV) receive a share of trading fees on the platform as well as a boost on their provided liquidity.

Risk Mitigation:
Curve DAO has been audited three times and is a fully decentralised Aragon DAO. Liquidity and trading volumes have been strong since launch. It currently has close to 12,000 holders as well as around 2600 governance participants. Looking at AAVE Risk Framework evaluation, I expect CRV to find itself around a B rating.

['Proposal: Add support for NOW Token'],"Hello, AAVE Community!
We are the team behind the ChangeNOW.io, an instant crypto exchange service. In 2018, we’ve issued our very own token, $NOW and would like to put forward a proposal of integrating the NOW Token to the AAVE platform.
ChangeNOW is a non-custodial service created for simple and fast cryptocurrency exchanges. We always strive for maximum safety, simplicity, and convenience and have worked on $NOW with the same principles in mind.
NOW is the first native digital asset introduced by an instant exchange platform. It was designed to serve as an internal currency on the NOW products (NOWPayments, NOW Nodes, etc). At this moment, NOW is used as a means of payment for ChangeNOW’s Asset Listing Campaign and the platform’s own stakeable token. NOW Token exists on both the Ethereum and Binance Сhain networks and is currently traded on IDEX, Binance DEX, and Uniswap.
We think that providing users with an ability to lend, borrow, and deposit $NOW using AAVE is a great idea because NOW is a fast and inexpensive asset that can be used for trading and to get discounts in the upcoming ChangeNOW loyalty program.
Plus, integrating NOW Token to AAVE Platform will be beneficial for both communities as it will lead to bigger exposure for both projects.
More information about the $NOW Token can be found here:

['RFC attempt for Feature Request: Safety module Improvement'],"Greetings, this will be my first Topic on the forum, first of all I am really happy to be here and hoping to help improve aave anyway I can.
I have been having reading the open topics for quite some time expecting that I’d find something similar to what I had in mind but I think there unfortunately I haven’t been able to spot one, so here is my attempt to put my idea out as a form of feature request,
PS: if there is anyone who can write it up better than I can please do so, as you will see I am really bad at putting things together:) + Sorry for the looong read.
I’ve read through the aavenomics more than once and I am really impressed. I can confidently say that it is one of the most detailed, complex and elegant tokenomics I’ve read so far and I am really happy to be one of the early supporters! However as I read it I can see that there are some areas where we can improve.
idea dump:
Each staker is an individual/group/organization with different risk appetites. Some would like more risk some are more conservative… When it comes to crypto, we all have our preferences on which coins, we support which we don’t. Unfortunately looking at the current mechanism I really feel uncomfortable about staking on aave.
Reason?: there are some coins that I’d happily take the risk some I wouldn’t
eg: (highly opinionated) I believe at some point USDT will go down, REP doesn’t really deserves the value it has, I am totally skeptic about BAT and the moves they have been doing lately… BUSD I wouldn’t touch anything binance does, GUSD I like the twins but still too corporate, too centralized and there has been some issues in the past… I can basically say something about each of the coins we have listed and the ones I mentioned above I do not feel comfortable at “insuring” in case of a shortfall because I am 90% sure there will be an extinction level event on one of those…
Proposal?:  add 1 more step to staking where user can select which of those token they’d like to insure.
story: As a user I’d like to be able to select the coins that I am providing safety to.
follow up idea: Distribute the rewards on each coin depending on their risk factors (you guys can definitely do better job with formalization since I am coming up with it as I go)
let’s start with a formula:
const risk_factor = { 'A+' = 0.1, 'A-' = 0.15, 'B-' = 0.25 ... };

const reward_factor = asset => 
      risk_factor[asset.avg_counterparty_risk] * asset.total_staked + 
      risk_factor[asset.avg_market_risk] * asset.total_staked;


put it in context:
// Lets assume there are only 2 assets ETH and WBTC
const { eth, wbtc } = assets;

// 100 people like me felt comfortable staking total of 1M$ to ETH
eth.total_staked = 1.000.000;      // from 100 stakers
eth.avg_counterparty_risk = 'A+';  // see docs
eth.avg_market_risk = 'A-';        // see docs

// 1m * 0.1 + 1m * 0.15 => 250k
eth.reward_factor = reward_factor(eth) ;

// 75 people felt comfortable staking total of 600k$ to WBTC
wbtc.total_staked = 500.000;       // from 75 stakers
wbtc.avg_counterparty_risk = 'B-'; // see docs
wbtc.avg_market_risk = 'B-';       // see docs

// 500k* 0.25 + 500k * 0.25 => 250k
wbtc.reward_factor = reward_factor(wbtc);

// 500.000
const total_factor = eth.reward_factor + wbtc.reward_factor;

const percentage = asset => 100 * asset.reward_factor / total_factor;

eth.reward_percentage = percentage(eth);   // 50%
wbtc.reward_percentage = percentage(wbtc); // 50%


Hope I made it kinda understandable there?
From the scenario above 50% of the total rewards will be devided between 75 btc stakers and 50% will be divided between 100 eth. stakers
Basically having this kind of a system we introduce an additional complexity to the system, but we are also expanding the possible ways people take risk and make investments. eg: for some it might make sense to cover a protocol that has high risk and low coverage, that way you take a lot of risk but also boost the reward significantly. Use other platforms to hedge the risk you have?
another possible benefit: both wbtc and eth stakers will have their 30% slashed in such event.
30% of 1M = 300k
30% of 500k = 150k
meaning ETH will have more coverage than WBTC which will increase the ETH health factor on the platform? Which can be used for further calculating things;
as an example we can also do taught experiments for the case when ‘total_covered >= total_deposited’ for each asset?

if there is enough cover for an asset, the asset can be used as collateral. (I can think of ideas with higher complexity there)

An exchange like Gemini want their GUSD listed and also be used as collateral? they know their protocol better than anyone and count on it? they can basically provide the initial stake on GUSD to bootstrap the trust by showing their faith on their asset? That provides additional income to Gemini while keeping the exposure only to their asset.  Also there is a dynamic like: their total income from aave decreases as they build trust in aave. keep staking or not?

Basically in my simple mind following will happen but probably people can think of more:

Users will have more choice when it comes to how they can secure the protocol
Users will get rewarded more for taking more risk and vice versa. But in general AAVE will benefit from the added complexity (more use cases)
Adding tokens will be much easier since the factor for calculating success is not “if it is listed” but “how much the community trusts the asset”.
Centralized parties are incentivised to keep users happy as long as they want to be a part of the aave ecosystem.
There is also a pressure buy and stake to AAVE if you want to increase the overall usage of your asset (basically put your money where your mouth is!)

['Collaboration with Loopring Protocol'],"Hello Aavengers,
I’d like to know what the Aave team and the community at large thinks about a potential integration of Aave within the Loopring wallet/protocol. I think anyone who pays any attention to the larger crypto space understands that L2 is crucial for the tide of upcoming users. I’ve been looking at the various L2 solutions out there with a focus on high standards of UX, TX performance and most importantly Security.
It was interesting to follow discussions about Optimistic Rollups, Plasma, Sidechains (xDai) and ZK Rollups in particular. By now I have no doubt that ZK Rollups scaling offers the highest security guarantees of all while enabling very cheap transactions. and that is a very powerful advantage in my view, as the importance of security and withdrawal guarantees to L1 cannot be underestimated.
At the same time I analyzed my behavior as a user of DeFi and I realized that I, and many others, need an all-inclusive solution starting with an L2 native wallet. Such a wallet must have native support for trading (order books and AMM), cheap transactions and integration with Money Markets and lending services (Aave/Compound/Maker). Argent for example has a lot to offer in this sense, but it lacks the main cornerstone - it is not L2 native. On the other hand the upcoming wallet from Loopring incorporates pretty much everything I’ve mentioned above, except for Money Markets/Lending services by default. Thus, I foresee a possibility for a very interesting linkage between Aave and Loopring, so that I and millions of other users can have a complete DeFi L2 dashboard at our fingertips. This is something we thoroughly need for sustainable mass adoption and Loopring can deliver.
Another point to be emphasized is the recent investment received by the Aave team of about 25 mln USD. Stani commented that among other things the funds would be used to help Aave team better serve the Asian markets. Loopring has been foremost focused on the Asian markets especially Chinese speaking users. This partnership could further benefit Aave in this sense.

['Proposal: Add support for TBTC'],"Proposal: Add support for TBTC
Joint Proposal by @ramaruro and @Estebank
Summary
We propose to add TBTC to AAVE for lending and borrowing. TBTC is the first fully decentralized Bitcoin version on Ethereum.
Details about TBTC
tBTC is a decentralized, trustless and insured custody system for Bitcoin that creates TBTC Ethereum ERC-20 tokens, with a 1:1 BTC supply peg. Bitcoin holders who want to spend their BTC on Ethereum and DeFi don’t have to trust custodians, aka signers, because signers must deposit a bond higher than the value of the BTC they hold in custody.
The tBTC system is developed by the Keep Network.
Benefits for AAVE
TVL Growth: Bitcoin on Ethereum is a fast growing category of Assets. Bitcoin has an enormous amount of value and it is important to attract that volume to AAVE and DeFi in general.
Risk Mitigation: TBTC is decentralized and does not have a central point of failure like renBTC or WBTC. Its addition reduces systemic Risk. It supports Point 3 of the AAVE Risk Framework evaluation for adding an Asset (which talks about the risk that centralized assets bring to the AAVE protocol).
Benefits for the general DeFi Community
Bring Optionality to the DeFi Community with a decentralized Bitcoin Exposure.
Decentralized Assets are essential for DeFi to stay “Decentralized”. It is very important to keep that prospective in mind as a lot of liquidity based on Centralized Assets has flown into the DeFi Ecosystem.
Current Liquidity and Availability
TBTC Contract: (https://etherscan.io/address/0x8daebade922df735c38c80c7ebd708af50815faa)
Pools available in Uniswap, Mooniswap, Curve and Balancer

['Proposal: Add support for TBTC'],"Hi everyone,
Considering the timing that I also just submitted a proposal for another BTC on Ethereum asset, I understand that my comment here will be perceived as biased. I’d like to state that I actually believe that greater volumes of liquidity from multiple BTC types would be overall beneficial for Aave protocol. However, with this particular asset, I am very hesitant for the following:
Here are my objective points of concern cited with sources:


TBTC’s previous failed launch history 5 months ago where people outside of the team identified the issues,
Lack of proven track record for this launch which has been 1 week according to their official Twitter,
Concerning concentration of staking as shown in @Arviee’s comment, and
Uncertain dashboards for collateralization ratios


As a heavy user and mindful investor of Aave, I am strongly against this proposal. I believe Keep has addressed only issue #4 in the past 2 days (please correct me if I’m wrong). Assuming Keep addresses these other concerns and proves it’s security and reliability over time, I do believe there is possibility to add their asset in the future.

It supports Point 3 of the AAVE Risk Framework evaluation for adding an Asset (which talks about the risk that centralized assets bring to the AAVE protocol).


@ramaruro, I appreciate you citing Aave’s Risk Framework. However, it seems you may be referring to it only with a positive bias for point 3. When reviewing the framework, point 2 outlines that a portion of the risk from each currency flows into the Aave protocol’s total risk - at least that is how I interpret it. Given my bullet points 1, 2, and 3 above, I strongly hope that the Aave community chooses not to subject the Aave protocol to such uncertain risk that TBTC brings. Please see a screenshot of Aave Risk Framework below to confirm or form your own interpretation of the risk.

First, I want to kick off by asking that everyone be respectful, and please disclose your bags. I see a number of folks here who comment on every Twitter thread related to tBTC, both for and against. Let’s not make the Aave forums a mess with mud slinging, and stick with technical and economic analysis, please.

 Bmrun:

A solution that is far from being tested enough. Over 50% of the staking value is from one address. 70% is from 3 addresses. Matt said he does KYC on 100% of all stakers. So how can that be decentralized?
Last time they launched in a hurry and switched it off because of critical flaws.


We haven’t KYC’d all stakers. We’ve KYC’d anyone that company has sold directly to, complying with all related regulations. That doesn’t include stakers that have bought on the open market or those that have earned rewards.



 Bmrun:

Last time they launched in a hurry and switched it off because of critical flaws.


To be clear, we launched after a 6 week audit of our fully open source clients and protocol. The team found an issue in a dApp clearly marked as alpha in our own testing, and decided to pause and spend over a quarter on additional audits and security practices. We take user fund security very seriously, and have avoided any shortcuts — including centralized custody of BTC.

I still think we can have a good discussion! Let’s just level set and be straight about tradeoffs.

Agreed. I think this proposal is early, and that we should see 1000 tBTC minted before this would make sense.

This is the most interesting point in this whole thread. So addressing it head-on…
Even if tBTC only had one signer, it still provides stronger user deposit guarantees than other systems on the market, like renBTC.
Why? If a staker in tBTC decides to censor a transaction, their bonds are seized and used to refund the harmed user. That’s the upside of a heavily collateralized system.

I’m still learning about Aave’s governance process and risk framework — I’m an occasional user and have huge respect for what the community and team have built, but I won’t pretend to be an expert.

['Proposal: Add Support for HUSD stablecoin'],"Hi All,
I notice that GUSD is applying for on boarding AAVE, so I am here to submit a proposal for adding support for stablecoin HUSD on AAVE. Since I am doing the same thing in DMM community.
Some info About HUSD:
Issuer: Stable Universal limited
Custodian: Paxos Trust
Backed by: U.S. Dollar, 1:1 ratio
Audit: Withum, monthly
Year of Issuance：July,2019
Twitter:https://twitter.com/Stablecoin_HUSD
Official Website:https://www.stcoins.com/
Attestation Reports: https://www.stcoins.com/attestation/index
Liquidity:

1:1 exchange with PAX on Paxos and Huobi official website
CEXs: Huobi Global,FTX,  Hotbit. HBTC, Hoo …
DEXs: Tokenlon, Kyber Network, Uniswap (in default list)
by the way, MakerDAO community has passed green light stage for adding HUSD as a new collectral, let’s see what will happen next.
Benefits for Aave:
Diversification of AAVE users: as the observation, most of the HUSD traders are large institutional traders, AAVE can provide competitive interest rate for them and attract more asset to locate on AAVE
More fiat on/off ramp choices: it seems that HUSD has advantages in Asia Pacific market, it will benifit users from those countries
Data of HUSD:

Circulating Marketcap: 132 million
Accumulated issuance: 2 billion
Trading Volume (24 hours): $ 20 million

Is compliance a test that DeFi will face in the future? I think so. Given that AAVE is also applying for a financial license and is also developing more compliance businesses, I think the subsequent asset selection also needs to be very cautious.
Because from a security perspective, trusts have a better debt isolation function. The so-called “bankruptcy isolation” means that when the trustor or the trustee goes bankrupt, the beneficiary can still maintain the benefit of the trust property and can oppose the ordinary creditors of the trustee and the trustee. In traditional credit financing with a bank as an intermediary, investors are merely creditors of the bank. When the bank goes bankrupt, they face a huge risk that their claims cannot be repaid. However, in trust investment, the investor no longer exists as a creditor of the bank, but as the owner of the trust property income, which helps reduce risks.",33,26.6,2020-10-30

In the perspective of AAVE, it’s better to support as more assets as possible, if the asset is safe enough. Because different assets will attract different users, to increase the diversify of the whole ecosystem, it’s a way to decrease the sysmetic risk.
And as for the liquidity, I don’t see it’s a problem.

Thanks for asking for this.As a team memver of HUSD, let me give a brief introduction, hope you can make it more clear about HUSD.
The HUSD token is issued by Stable Universal Limited (a BVI company), an independently-run affiliate of Huobi Group.
The assets backing the HUSD are custodied by Paxos Trust Company (a NY-registered trust company) and attested by a US audit firm, neither of which are Huobi subsidiaries or affiliates.
Although not a direct Huobi-issued product, HUSD was first listed on Huobi Group’s global exchange, Huobi Global, on July 20th, 2019.
And I don’t think Centralization for stablecoin is a bad thing, since it’s related to fiat, so we must follow the regulation and must have KYC/AML procedures. So that we can provide a secure and safe service for clients and users.

['PowerIndex Grant Program for the AAVE Protocol'],"Hello, AAVE community! We publish this post as our community considers AAVE as one of the most likely participants of PowerIndex, a decentralized Defi ETF-like product. Currently, LEND token is a participant of PowerIndex MVP version - Baby PowerIndex (index will migrate to AAVE in 24hrs).
Baby PowerIndex is a Smart Defi Index, composed of 8 governance tokens (YFI AAVE SNX COMP MKR UNI WNXM CVP). Currently, it is an unaudited MVP version live in mainnet, so everyone can play with it to see how it works. It has a certain liquidity cap ($550k) which is completely filled by our community.
For the main PowerIndex (uncapped audited version) token set will be defined by community voting. For the end-user, index share is represented by PIPT (PowerIndex Pool Token), which allows users to operate with a basket of 8 tokens using a single token.
We call this index a “smart” one due to the following features:

All pooled tokens can be used for governance (voting) in composite protocols.
All pooled tokens can be used for fund management strategies. All cashflows are distributed to the token holders. Also, index LPs mine CVP (the Concentrated Voting Power tokens, which integrate all pooled voting power of composite protocols) as additional source of income.
Community can entirely govern the index, changing token set, weights of tokens, and pool fees via proposals.

We see the following value proposition for AAVE and its community in case if AAVE will added into the index:

The end-users of the index (Defi community) will get a stake in AAVE simply by buying index token PIPT. So, any index user (PIPT holder) will be an AAVE holder at the same time.
Index stores all governance tokens in a special contract (check out Baby PowerIndex contract). All pooled tokens are used by PowerPool (CVP) token holders for voting on proposals (we call this process meta-governance). As all pooled tokens will vote at every AAVE voting, this will contribute to solving the Voters’ Apathy problem.
As PIPT is an interest-collecting token (cashflows will be generated by using pooled tokens in fund management strategies), liquidity providers will receive additional cashflows by providing their governance tokens, for example AAVE to the index.

In addition to the mentioned cashflows, all LPs will earn CVP tokens for provided liquidity according to the CVP LM program.

PowerIndex allows swap tokens which are pooled inside the index contract. So, addition of AAVE into the index would allow to swap other governance tokens to AAVE and vice versa without any intermediary trades, boosting its liquidity.
As a result of index capitalization growth, a lot of AAVE tokens will be pooled inside the contract, which will help to maintain AAVE market price acting as a supply sink.

Additionally, as it was discussed with the representative of the AAVE team, there is a possibility to establish a lending market on AAVE for PIPT, PowerIndex token. It will work as an additional secondary market with the option to lend and borrow index tokens. For the AAVE community, it will provide an exposure to the PIPT and allow it to use a curated basket of Defi tokens in their trading and hedging strategies via the AAVE market. Also, when the cap and liquidity of PIPT will be bigger, such ETF-like index token can become a good example of curated collateral for specific purposes.
The PowerIndex participants grant program
Today we are proud to announce the grant program for PowerIndex composite protocols and Protocol Politicians, elected by their communities. Allocation of these grants was approved by the CVP community in Proposal 6.
This program is aimed to establish community partnership. It will engage communities interaction and bring additional value for AAVE token holders and its governance system and PowerPool meta-governance protocol.
It is planned to allocate as much as 1% of CVP supply (1m CVP) to each protocol, which will be elected as PowerIndex member in upcoming community voting.
This grant will be divided into two parts: the main one (900k CVP) will be under control of the AAVE community and the rest of it (100k) will be divided into individual grants for two AAVE active and trusted community members - we name such persons a Protocol Politicians.
Two grant recipients will be elected by the protocol’s community. PowerPool itself and CVP token holders have nothing to do with that.
The purposes of grants allocation
As it was stated in a recently published article, there is no real democracy without rewards. In common words to achieve a high level of participation in the on-chain governance the community needs to be motivated and engaged enough.
Meta-governance is not only about accumulating governance tokens inside the protocol. It is about the proper people’s organization and motivation.
Since the community is the key for meta-governance (while pooling GT liquidity is a necessary but not sufficient condition for building such a system), we decided to provide leverage in PowerPool votings for every composite protocol.
So, the community of each composite protocol would be able to have its own loud voice and defend their interests in any PowerPool proposal.
From one side, it will engage the community of these protocols into PowerPool governance, and from the other one will provide an opportunity for index participants to create a sort of coalition and influence index management.
To enhance this community engagement effect, we decided to allocate 100k CVP for two protocol politicians from each protocol. These grants will be individual ones.
Rules of individual grants allocation:

A person should be elected by the protocol community. For example, Protocol Politicians from AAVE should be elected by the AAVE community
There are no restrictions: Protocol Politicians can be protocol team members, majority token holder, minority token holder, accidentally PowerPool’s alpha/beta/gamma tester. Only the community decides who will be elected.
Protocol Politicians from composite protocols aren’t required to have a CVP stake.
Each protocol can define their own rules of resignation in case of Protocol Politician misbehavior. We will discuss options for that with each protocol team individually (note, granted tokens would be anyway on a vesting contract).

Basic duties of Protocol Politicians:

To act as a diplomat between his own protocol and PowerPool - helping with communication between communities, including community calls, intro(s) if necessary, establishing collaboration on mutual research, articles, tweets, announcements, etc.
To inform community members about future and ongoing development, proposals, community activity, etc. People from AAVE and PowerPool need to be aware of activity in both protocols.
To help with community-based technical integration. Here it means to facilitate all stuff related to community-driven tech development.
Supporting community partnership. We consider protocols, which are exchanged with Protocol Politicians as partnered on the basis of community needs.
Any other duties, specified by the community of the composite protocol. Each protocol can add their own duties and tasks for Protocol Politicians.

Roadmap for Grants
The roadmap for grants depends on the main PowerIndex launch roadmap. It is presented below:

Posting on governance forums of protocols, which probably could become PowerIndex composite protocols. We expect it will take ~2-4 days from now. Until voting (the point 2 of this list) passes, all stuff regarding the election and resignation processes will be discussed on community forums.
Community voting on PowerIndex composition (~7-14 days from now).
Final election of Protocol Politicians, preparation of protocol’s treasures to use CVP voting rights in PowerPool governance. Integration of new sources of votes into PowerPool modular governance system
Launch of audited and uncapped PowerIndex

I totally agree for the rescue mission as I am in the same situation where my Lend is also locked in transaction harsh: 0x80fb784b7ed66730e8b1dbd9820afd29931aab03
I also suggest a bounce back function to avoid this happening to many.

Hi guys, last week I transferred some of my Aave Lend Tokens from my Ledger Nano to my account at the Liquid Exchange. According to Etherscan (I have a copy) the transaction was a success and the tokens were transferred ok. The problem is they never arrived, I have now spoken to Liquid’s customer support but they have told me that they don’t accept Aave Lend Tokens only Aave New and that’s why I never received them. Is it possible to retrieve these tokens or have they been permanently lost???

I vote to save the stuck tokens. I messed up by sending my Lend-AAVE tokens from Binance to Coinbase before migrating to AAVE. I realized it to late to cancel the contract transaction, now my Lend-AAVE tokens are stuck in the contract. Please help us resolve the issue of stuck in Etherscan IO Blockchain. It show success, but of course they are stuck. Totally my fault, but I should not have to lose my tokens.

Considering that releasing tokens stuck in multiple smart contracts of the ecosystem requires different upgrades on critical parts of the system, the solution is being carefully evaluated before proposing to governance.
But as @Zer0dot mentioned, there should be news pretty soon

['Proposal: Add Support for Rari Capital Tokens'],"Summary:
Add the Rari Capital ecosystem tokens (RSPT, RYPT, REPT, and RGT) as borrowing collateral. Proposal by the Rari Team
Background:
Rari Capital has just launched v2 of their robo-advisor product, featuring the Rari Stable Pool, Rari Yield Pool, Rari ETH Pool, and Rari Governance Token. The first three are their specific yield earning pools with IOU tokens similar to aDai (represents 1 stablecoin deposited + interest) and the fourth is the governance token. One of their integrated strategies involves lending on Aave.
With Rari’s TVL rising rapidly (jumped to $70m after 72 hours) support for Rari Capital tokens would allow any depositors into Rari to borrow on Aave using their Rari tokens as collateral, increasing Aave’s market size, TVL, and utility.

['Proposal: Add Support for yAssets'],"yAssets:
With the imminent release of v.2.0 yearn vaults the creation of a new layer of currency within the system is likely to grow in importance. In order to capture this capital AAVE has an opportunity to provide a secure deposit base to benefit from the growth in the yearn TVL.
Propose to add yUSD, yYFI, yETH and yBTC (once operational) at the same collateral and reserve ratios as the base layer assets. Since these assets are accruing value through the strategies over time, there should be comfort in providing the same loan to value ratios on these assets, however, suggest that the liquidation threshold is either aligned to the loan to value or reduced by 50%. With the new mechanics being built into the vaults to allow debt portability in the event of a market downturn (powered by AAVE) there is improved safety from the AAVE module perspective.
CREAM currently provides this support on yUSD and yETH, however, the greater level of platform security, integration with DefiSaver automation and more transparent liquidation mechanics within AAVE present a unique opportunity to ensure this value is captured within AAVE rather than a competitor, and allow AAVE to grow alongside the yearn ecosystem. For holders of large positions within the yearn vaults this added security and transparency will be crucial to deposit yAssets, and AAVE should ensure that it is positioned to capitalize on this opportunity once the new vault system launches.

['Proposal: Add Support for yAssets'],"Hello,
there’s a lot of synergies with the yearn and curve ecosystems, I personally use and support both projects.
on the technical side, most yAssets are already deposits in Aave.
in order to increase overall yield, yEarn leverage on DeFi composability and as an example, 1 DAI deposited into a Yearn vault is deposited in Curve Y pool then deposited into AAVE.
this kind of synergies increase overall yield and is a very good thing in my eyes, it’s the same for many other actors such as Harvest finance or mStable.
In the case of having yUSD as collateral, I think a good potential solution might be to create a yearn and/or curve market, allowing usage of “yyUSD” and Curve “yCRV” as collateral to segregate liquidity and risk. Aave v2 allows a much more efficient multi-market approach

['Proposal to add AAVE as collateral only'],"Dear All,
This is a call to action for the Aave community to signal the intention to add/or not AAVE as collateral only on the AAVE platform.
Here are the pros and cons of this addition that I have identified so far.
Cons:

At the moment AAVE has almost no liquidity. However this is about to change very quickly as Binance has scheduled the internal migration on October 12th and many other exchanges will follow suit in the next two weeks.

Pros:

The migration of the existing LEND collateral straight into AAVE. At the moment there is a significant amount of LEND just waiting for the transition as a collateral in AAVE. There is no point for the owners of that lend to convert to AAVE as they cannot deposit it back. They can stake it sure, but not everyone may want to stake AAVE, many may want to use it as collateral instead for other purposes.
Since the biggest problem is liquidity and pricing feeds it makes sense to wait until AAVE reaches a minimum threshold of daily volume of 20 mln USD/day. Once the threshold is reached, the AIP may be put up for a vote.
Nevertheless, we should at least signal the intent as a community so as to not waste time unnecessarily and assure other usage options for AAVE as its liquidity grows.
",97,599.4,2020-11-05
['Proposal to add AAVE as collateral only'],"I agree, and would like to see this come to fruition. The conversion will stagger without the ability to swap LEND being used as collateral, for AAVE (to be used as collateral). How about an autonomous swap of aLEND to aAAVE and to be used as collateral - added to the asset list as well.",92,53.4,2020-10-05
['Proposal to add AAVE as collateral only'],"and… this is probably the most important change needed asap to allow the full-effect of the ecosystem, without disruption to depositors, LEND-ers who have loan positions in LEND. Otherwise, value stabilization is at risk and unnecessary fees and moving around of currencies just to do this conversion ‘as is’
BUMP.",90,48.0,2020-10-05
['Proposal to add AAVE as collateral only'],"I’m in full support of having AAVE as collateral.
I think in the short term, there is some liquidity shortage which may cause issues for an acceptable risk assessment - but if that’s the case it wont be long until that’s no longer an issue.
As the liquidity grows by the day it’d be great to see some more thoughts on this so that we have the ground covered for when there’s enough liquidity.
edit: adding on to this, it did occur to me the current use case of LEND as collateral, which is just that, only collateral. Users don’t earn interest on the LEND deposited currently, but what if they did earn interest on AAVE? Would this be competing with the safety module for AAVE deposits?",86,67.2,2020-10-05
['Proposal to add AAVE as collateral only'],"Yes! That’s a no brainer for me!

['Proposal to add AAVE as collateral only'],"


 defidude:

Would this be competing with the safety module for AAVE deposits?


This is exactly what popped into my mind. AAVE is first and foremost a governance token and the protocol’s in-built insurance system. Inherently, AAVE as collateral is AAVE out of the safety module.
Depending on our long-term compensation model for staked AAVE, market forces would ideally push the yield on stkAAVE to be higher than aAAVE, to compensate the higher risk.
With that said, as slashing gets enabled, one of Aave’s main value propositions will be the in-built safety module. If we enable borrowing of AAVE, we’re taking value out of that proposition.
Definitely an interesting conversation to have. I wouldn’t be against allowing its use purely as collateral at all though!",67,93.4,2020-10-05
['Proposal to add AAVE as collateral only'],"I don’t  think you take value away from staking, as some will find other ways to use Aave and some don’t want to be forced in locking up their assets for a period of time. Other DeFi coins (yfi etc) do exactly this, and leave it up to choice of what the individual is willing to risk and utilize freely. To take away the ability in current collateral loan positions would be going backwards, imo. Having a choice to use the value of the token elsewhere, whether in The AAVE platform or other platforms is a necessity",61,42.2,2020-10-06
['Proposal to add AAVE as collateral only'],"Yes I think the market forces might push more towards rewarding StkAAVE more compared to aAAVE, really depends on the market of course and the governance to decide upon incentives in the future. Besides being as a collateral since due to the migration and positions open as borrowings, a script might be needed to be developed to migrate aLEND to aAAVE without affecting borrow positions.",58,61.6,2020-10-06
['Proposal to add AAVE as collateral only'],"I would argue, collateral usage, to borrow against and leverage a loan position is an advantage in that the value of doing so isn’t based on staking. If some type of interest is earned, that is a bonus, but not necessarily needed…
If someone wants to stake, and risk, and earn- that is up to the user. If someone wants to take a loan against the collateral value, that is a totally different aspect - again, non-competing.
Thoughts on:::::::::
To address the “competing” concern, Is there a probability to stake and use the staked AAVE as collateral ? Simultaneous Of staked AAVE = deposited AAVE and a flip switch button to “use as collateral” —- maybe with a lower collateral percentage ?
I am all for the collateral usage and script to help this along. I have noticed LEND deposited has gone from over $400M to around $60M, since the migration began.",54,40.8,2020-10-06

['ARC - Greenlight Aave Sagl (the company) to do certain types of changes without having to go through the AIP process'],"Technically speaking, the next update of the protocol would have the ability to delegate votes to other addresses. This means that anyone can delegate to whom they might fit to vote on their behalf. That is something that can help technically if such objectives are required.
Currently the Aave Protocol is open-source and runs autonomously on Ethereum. If there is any significant changes, these should go trough governance decision making especially if it involves incentives. It’s important that there is wide decentralization and mandate to cover this decision making by the token holders as they are end of the day bearing the risk of the protocol.
However, governance does not need to be slow or inefficient, this means that there should be many various topics open for discussions and those topics that are more progressed could progress to a formal proposal accordingly to the AIP framework.
What could be important is to set different kind of minimum thresholds of various voting topics such as assets listings, small protocol upgrades in the future and incentives changes, for example what would the minimum voting period be set. This might provide the needed flexibility to AIPs and their progresses.
One of the things that takes time is usually configuring the payload to correspond the execution of a voting outcome or might be an external factor (for example in case of listing AAVE, the price feeds by Chainlink was recently set as the asset was available on multiple market venues).
I guess the bigger question of this thread is as @Laur pointed out: what kind of actions or ideas we could come up with to keep the agile progress on AIPs without compromising the security/diligence of code deployment and ensuring that there is due process in voting. Would definitely like to hear more opinions on this topic.

['Permissionless addition of new tokens to aave (like uniswap)'],"Why isn’t this a thing? It would bring free extra volume to aave, be more in line with the crypto ethos, and redirect the discussion on this board to actually improving the base functionality of the platform instead of mostly being “pls list x token next”.
As an example of how these two approaches differ, Uniswap (permissionless listing dex) vs Kyber (permissioned listing dex). Just 9 months ago they had similar volume. Now, Uniswap is about 400x the daily volume of Kyber.
As for regulations, this would also decentralize power from the team, which would make aave less of a potential security if the cftc’s Tabert is to be believed “The more decentralized it becomes over time and the more that it effectively runs itself, the more likely it is it’s going to fall within the commodity category and not the securities“",46,114.2,2020-11-05

If you are concerned about low liquidity, we can keep the approved token list with manual loan parameters.
But there can also be an “unapproved token” section. With these tokens , when or if it comes time to liquidation there are multiple ways around that for unapproved tokens that would be unique to them:
1.much lower maximum loan to value ratio,
2.much higher interest rate spread between borrowing and lending (which would be immediately sold into eth/stablecoin and go into an aave safety pool for that token in case of shortfall),
3. paying a percentage of face value fee in stablecoin/eth on loan origination to further bolster the shortfall fund,
4. Limit on the total amount of an unapproved coin can be deposited as collateral in total
5. On the payback of the loan, funds from 2 and 3 rewarded to aave stakers.

Getting those values wrong could easily lead to someone borrowing and running away, leaving worthless collateral – which would directly impact AAVE holders via the safety module.

['Aave Protocol Token Addition - Community Sentiment Poll'],"After the success of AIP-1 and already more than a third of the LEND supply upgraded to the AAVE asset, the community governance can now focus on the next improvement for the Aave Protocol.
This topic focuses on new asset additions to the main Aave Market that have been debated in other threads.
The most efficient way to host constructive debates and gather feedback on community sentiment is to narrow the discussion focus on reasonably sized batches of assets.
This first batch is composed of 3 assets: AAVE, UNI and GUSD. The other assets currently discussed in the governance forum will have their time to shine in the following batches.
AAVE
The first asset is AAVE, the center of gravity of the Aave Protocol governance.
The AAVE asset is fairly new, but already has a decent amount of decentralized liquidity in Uniswap, Balancer, and Sushiswap with clear CeFi Announcements of migration support and AAVE listing such as on Binance (Blogpost)
The addition of the token AAVE into the main market will allow the creation of an end -> aAAVE “collateral swap” feature, allowing current aLEND holders to migrate without being forced to close their current position.
There’s currently 187M aLEND in the Aave Protocol, ~15% of the total supply.
The recommendation of the Risk team would be to keep the LEND risk parameters:




LTV
Liquidation threshold
Liquidation Bonus




50%
65%
10%



UNI
UNI is the governance token of Uniswap Protocol, the DEX with the highest volume. It was distributed to users and liquidity providers gathering a diverse crowd of governors. The Uniswap DAO is now the DAO with the highest value under management.
UNI is supported by the platform Compound with a 65% collateral factor.
Given the short existence of UNI on the market and the current volatility,
the Risk team recommends a slightly more conservative set of parameters:




LTV
Liquidation threshold
Liquidation Bonus




40%
65%
15%



Please consider the details of the Risk team’s opinion below :
UNI Smart Contract Risk: B-
The UNI token is audited and has been impressively battle-tested, with nearly 800k transactions for such a short life of 21 days. The smart contract uses some of COMP’s token code which has been tested by the markets.
UNI Counterparty Risk: B+
UNI is a permissionless token launched in some of the fairest ways witnessed. The Uniswap team, which has an impressive track record, will be giving up power over the protocol gradually over the next 6 months.
UNI Market Risk: B-
The UNI token has been really well received by the community. The price quickly increased from nothing to around $3, leading to high volatility but also growing the market capitalization.
GUSD
GUSD is issued by Gemini Trust Company. It has been created for practical use in innovative applications, which  facilitate Gemini’s institutional solutions and exchange operations.
GUSD addition would create more bridges between CeFi and DeFi and can be one more step towards successful synergies between the Aave community and the Gemini ecosystem, especially with features such as Credit Delegation.
Being a Centralized Asset with an emerging presence in the DeFi ecosystem, the recommended risk parameters are to allow GUSD as a borrowable currency, but not as collateral.
Please consider the following Risk team opinion about GUSD below:
GUSD Smart contract Risk: C-
GUSD was launched in September 2018 – at the same time as USDC – yet it has just under 100k blockchain transactions. The token is mostly used within the centralized Gemini environment.
GUSD Counterparty Risk: B- cannot use as collateral
As it is backed by real US dollars, GUSD is centralized. An independent accountant’s audit report is published at the end of each month on the website. Furthermore, GUSD is regulated bringing trust to the token. Still, the infrastructure is based on the Ethereum blockchain where regulators have little power.
GUSD Market Risk: B
GUSD has a small market capitalization of $11m with one of the smallest trading volumes among stablecoins. It is backed by real USD and has managed to keep its peg well showing little volatility.

The poll in this thread is a community sentiment poll in order to centralize the opinions of the community and easily identify strong support or opposition about an asset.
Feel free to express your voice by voting and feel free to express your constructive opinion in this thread.

['Early discussion regarding a potential Aave stablecoin'],"In the light of the recent acquisition by Aave of a EMI license in UK, I would like to kick-start an early discussion aimed at brainstorming ideas for the use of this capability for the Aave ecosystem and the entire DeFi ecosystem as a whole.
It occurred to me that Aave  TradFi entity could serve as an efficient fiat on-ramp not only to the Aave lending protocol but for the entire crypto market. Thus it would make sense if it would launch a USDC-like stablecoin, pegged to the fiat deposits from different regions in which it would operate.
The stablecoin smart contracts could be developed and integrated from the start with the most prominent wallets such as Argent, and more importantly the upcoming Loopring wallet which is L2 by default. In fact the whole architecture of the said stablecoin should be focused on L2 primarily which would bring a lot more users to L2 just by sheer convenience of it.
Now the really fun part is of course its characteristics as a tool for a decentralized savings account. The Aave protocol can generate a healthy amount of fees especially after it achieves critical mass in terms of TVL and loan volumes. These fees or a part of them can be distributed as interest (on top of standard deposit and liquidity rewards) to the stablecoin holders, provided of course that they deposit the stablecoin in the Aave protocol. Once it gets borrowed, it will find its way across all of DeFi.
This reward mechanism would make it the most desirable stablecoin to hold throughout the ecosystem, even more so when one takes into account the security of the Aave protocol insured by the Safety Module and the backstop mechanism.",64,252.8,2020-09-18

Interestingly, once depos from users are taken in fiat and stablecoins are issued there is of course the yields from Aave protocol that could be directed to the stablecoin holders. Taking the idea further, I could imagine that the underlying fiat can be deposited so something liquid and low volatility products in TradFi and those depos tokenized as well and bringing more liquidity and yields for the Aave protocol.

I’ve seen plenty of rhetoric about banking the unbanked, but really so far crypto has only enabled those with capital to spare to play at a better casino than the stock market, where information asymmetry gives them significant advantages.
In this sense one cannot help but think that a stablecoin design that relies on both CBDCs (coming I believe in the next 5 years) and a Maker-like system could potentially be more resilient than USDC or DAI are on their own for example, while providing an opportunity for the community to invest in the future of many other people around the globe.

This for sure. Fiat -> AaveUSD stablecoin could be huge. If we wanted more AaveUSD volume, we can even consider current, existing collateral.
I’d imagine we can create “vaults” with any existing collateral to mint AaveUSD… e.g. mint with wBTC. There’s also the potential to integrate something like RenJS to create functionality for users to mint AaveUSD with BTC in 1 tx. Just brainstorming since this is early discussion, but the flow could be BTC -> RenVM -> renBTC -> Curve swap -> wBTC -> Aave -> AaveUSD. If the pending proposal to add support for renBTC is added, then the Curve -> wBTC part could also be skipped. If the AaveUSD step is too far off, this SDK/process could still be used now to build up that collateral pool for future AaveUSD minting.
Not sure if what I described would be interesting to folks here, but I personally think having a UX like that would:

significantly lower the barriers to entry for newcomers/bitcoiners,
lead to greater adoption, and

$SAND will enable players to create, play, own, govern, trade and earn within The Sandbox virtual world gaming platform. It is the ERC-20 token that will be used all across The Sandbox metaverse.
$SAND tokens have the following utility on The Sandbox platform
1/ Medium of exchange: Players can potentially collect SAND through gameplay, and subsequently spend $SAND to play games, purchase equipment, or customize Avatar characters. Creators can spend SAND to acquire ASSETS and LAND. Artists can spend SAND to upload ASSETS to the Marketplace and buy GEMs for defining item rarity.
2/ Governance: $SAND allows holders to participate in governance decisions. SAND owners can vote themselves or delegate voting rights to other players of their choice.
3/ Staking: Users can stake $SAND tokens to earn rewards, as well as GEMs and CATALYSTs for ASSETS creation.
SAND Utility2096×1134 177 KB
We’ve been working since July 2018 (2 years ago) on the new version of the game, 3D, multiplayer, multi-platform and using blockchain technology to offer a virtual world built on the Ethereum blockchain, where players can build, own, and monetize their gaming experiences.
We’ve raised $4.5M USD from reputable investors on our Seed Round, including from Hashed (#1 cryptofund in Korea, True Global Ventures and Square Enix the video game company)
We have more 60 partnerships with award-winning game companies such as Atari, top decentralized games such as Crypto Kitties, major brands such as Shaun the Sheep, Rollercoaster Tycoon or Care Bears to build a fun, creative “play-to-earn” Gaming platform, owned and made by players.
With The Sandbox, we aim to overcome these limitations by building a decentralized gaming platform where creators are able to craft, play, share, collect, and trade without central control, enjoying secure ownership with the ability to earn cryptocurrency ($SAND). This ownership will be established and guaranteed through the use of NFTs, where every in-game item will have a unique and immutable blockchain identifier.
We do believe millions of players are interested in exploring the benefits of decentralization, interoperability, and the creator’s ecosystem.
Looking forward to hear back and thank you for your vote!
We’re looking forward seeing you in our community
Kind regards

['Usecase proposal : Make Aave even greater'],"Hi, I would like to give some input into Aave as we are now able to do some by ourselves!
My suggestion is to add more value to Aave.
Why do we need value for Aave?
Right now Aave is having a solid system, there are plenty people using the Dapp and it is safe. No hacks, no critical bugs. But what about the token itself? What usecase does is have? Right now the only use case is to stake, provide liquidity and farm a little bit and take part in AIP.
This means, if you aren’t really interested in these topics you are just a hodler or trader. But what are the benefits then for you? Not that much.
My proposal is to add value to hodler or trader and even user of Aave market.
How could this look like?
Well, in my opinion the Aave token should be used for lower fees. A good example for this would be ybitpanda with the token Best. With Best you are able to save fees within their whole ecosystem. So adapted on Aave this would mean, if you want to take a loan your fees will be x%, but if you hold or use Aave your fees will be deducted by x%.
There could be 2 possible scenarios, either you have to hodl them and reach a special level. E.g. For Aave Level 1 you will need 50 Aave and your fees will be reduced by x%. Or the other way could be that, whenever you want to take a loan or borrow or whatever, you can use Aave to reduce your fees and these Aave will be collected and monthly distributed to hodler that are having a special amount of Aave. For example you must hodl at least 20 Aave to be egliable.
And this example could be used in every market to benefit from using the token. Either if you are just a hodler or active platform user or even both.
The next usecase for Aave could be that if you are providing liquidity in Dai and also add some Aave ( like in a uniswap pool) then you will be higher rewarded. In this case a level system could be possible again.
Please feel free to comment and tell me if I got something wrong or if you do even have better ideas!
Because we are know the ones who need to buidl!

I would suggest two models to be implemented
1)A burning model, capped to 3M Aave tokens.
2) An amount of the collected fees by Aave platform , would be distributed on a monthly basis, among all Aave Stacked holders. This would give Aave holders and extra incentive.

i think that we can much more easily reduce the supply with a deadline for migration. and it costs nothing. we have to give the people for sure some weeks, but to bring things in place, we should think about it.

Chainlink has 350m token and was close to 20$.
I don’t get this, we need lower supply stuff.
Get YFV if you want a low supply token. If aave reaches the same price and you would need it to execute something on the dapp. Who do you think would use it?

Welcome to Aave’s governance discussion forum!
________

This forum is dedicated to Aave’s governance discussion for matters such as Aave Improvement Proposals (AIPs), risk factors, and general governance discussions otherwise not mentioned.
The protocol governance consists of the decision-making process for the different risk parameter changes, improvements, and incentives that constitute the policies. Future decisions governing the protocol will be enacted through this procedure.
The AAVE token empowers holders with the capability to vote on proposals and collectively act as governors of the protocol.
To learn more about the protocol’s governance, please refer to the Aavenomics.
Aavenomics Key Summary:


Aavenomics present a governance framework to grant key decision making to AAVE tokenholders.


LEND will migrate to AAVE, via a Genesis Governance vote, at a rate of 100 LEND per 1 AAVE.


The total supply of AAVE will be 16M tokens.


13M AAVE tokens will be redeemed by LEND token holders.


3M AAVE tokens will be allocated to the Aave Ecosystem Reserve.


Aave will launch a Safety Module (SM) for staked AAVE to act as collateral of last resort.


Aave will introduce safety and ecosystem incentives to reward protocol growth.


Aavenomics introduces Aave Improvement Proposals (AIPs) for future protocol upgrades.


Governance defines a set of Policies by which the Aave Protocol and Money Markets abide by.

['TUSD Smart Contract Update Request'],"Hey folks, we would like to make a small update to the TUSD smart contract and want to get the thumbs-up from the AAVE team & community before doing so. We’ve already contacted the AAVE team and they will be posting an update once they’re finished reviewing the new code. Thanks for your help.
Details on the update:


On Sept 16th we upgraded the TUSD smart contract based on feedback from the Maker and AAVE teams. This upgrade massively simplified the TUSD smart contract but also left out one feature which we’re now realizing was important: supporting our legacy (pre-Jan 2019) TUSD smart contract.


The legacy contract was launched in March 2018 before the upgradable proxy pattern was standard, and instead of full upgradability, it included the ability to forward transfer() calls to a new address. We migrated to an upgradable proxy in Jan 2019 with a full announcement and instructions for integrators.


After the on Sept 16th, we were contacted by IDEX who is having the following issue: they were continuing to rely on the legacy TUSD smart contract, and while they are able to integrate the new TUSD smart contract, their smart contract is unable to understand that ‘old TUSD’ balances are actually now ‘new TUSD’ balances (of course all balances are moved over, the old smart contract just forwards calls similar to a 301 redirect on the web). This issue with IDEX affects about $130k TUSD.


We want to make sure these IDEX users are taken care of and that’s why we’re requesting this change.


Of course we would not perform an upgrade without the AAVE team & community reviewing the new implementation. The new implementation has already been audited, both code and audit are linked below.
Thanks for working with us, and please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

['Proposal: Add support for CACHE Gold (CGT)'],"CACHE Gold Summary
CACHE Gold tokens are fully regulated, public, transparent, redeemable tokens backed by gold stored in vaults around the world. Each token is backed by one gram of pure, investment grade gold. CACHE Gold is different from other gold backed tokens in several key ways:


Superior transparency:  Through the CACHE Gold Explorer , CACHE provides real-time tracking data on all the bars backing CACHE Gold. Tracking data includes location, photograph, serial number, weight, purity, refiner, current valuation and more. Tracking data is provided directly by the vaults that store the gold (Brink’s, Loomis, Dillon Gage IDS and The Safe House).

Superior redemption options:  CACHE Gold provides multiple redemption options in multiple regions: vault pickup, shipping, or sale for USD. CACHE also provides significantly smaller 100 gram ($6,250) and 1 kilogram ($62,500) bars than the 400 toz LBMA good delivery bars (~$750,000+) that competing tokens offer for redemption.

Decentralized: Unlike competing tokens, CACHE limits its role to exchanging physical gold for tokens and vice versa. Liquidity, vaulting and exchange are left to reputable industry leading firms. This provides a number of benefits such as eliminating a single point of failure and creating a competitive market place for token holders to sell or ship their redeemed gold. CACHE is designed such that any reputable industry firm (vaults, dealers, retailers, distributors, logistics companies, exchanges, etc.) can participate in and profit from the CACHE Gold ecosystem.

Flexibility:  CACHE Gold is backed by pure grams of gold and its asset tracking system GramChain can support any type of gold, regardless of weight or purity, as long as it meets industry standards for investment grade gold. CACHE Gold is currently backed exclusively by 100 gram and 1 kilogram bars, but this may change over time as market demand dictates.

Industry Experience:  Unlike other gold backed tokens, CACHE Gold was founded, designed and developed by precious metals and vaulting industry veterans.

Publicly Auditable: A token audit takes about 1 minute to perform for anyone with access to a web browser:

Step 1. Get the number of CACHE Locked gold grams from the CACHE Explorer:  34,301.57  (as of 05-09-2020 ~10:51 UTC)
Step 2. Get the number of unbacked tokens that are locked in the CACHE Unbacked Treasury:  0.0
Step 3. Get the total number of CACHE Gold Tokens (“Total Supply” on Etherscan) ever minted:  34,301.57
Step 4. Calculate CACHE Gold tokens in circulation:
Total Supply (34,301.57) - CACHE Unbacked Treasury (0.0) = 34,301.57
Step 5. Determine if the tokens in circulation are greater than or equal to CACHE Locked gold grams? If so CACHE has passed its token audit. In this case:
34,301.57 CACHE Gold in Circulation <= 34,301.57 Toal CACHE Gold minted (“Total Supply”)
Compare this to the results of a similar exercise on other gold backed tokens. 
It would also be trivial for any independent third party to run an automated monitor to ensure full gold backing at all times because all of the relevant data is always public.
All vaults (Brink’s, Loomis, Dillon Gage IDS and The Safe House) that store gold backing CACHE Gold are also independently audited and insured.
Project History
CACHE Private Limited was incorporated in Singapore in August 2018 with the goal of designing and developing a regulated, transparent, freely tradable, fully redeemable gold token that can scale to millions of ounces (billions of dollars USD). CACHE Gold token launched on the Ethereum mainnet on February 21, 2020.
How are CACHE Gold tokens used?
Each CACHE Gold token is backed by one gram of pure investment grade gold. CACHE Gold is used to track the current spot price of gold and is redeemable on demand for physical gold bars or the equivalent value in USD. See this video for more details on what CACHE Gold is used for.
How is CACHE Gold licensed and regulated?
CACHE Private Limited was incorporated in Singapore and is [licensed and regulated by the Singapore Ministry of Law as a precious stones and precious metals dealer.
Where can you trade CACHE Gold?
CACHE Gold is currently traded on centralized (e.g. Bittrex Global) and decentralized (e.g. Uniswap) digital asset exchanges. Redemption orders can be submitted on CACHE’s website 24/7.
Does CACHE Gold have a legal opinion?
Yes we have. CACHE Gold is not a security, financial instrument or digital payment token, it is an asset backed token.
Can CACHE Gold freeze/blacklist addresses or confiscate tokens?
No, this functionality is not part of CACHE Gold’s smart contracts.
Oracle / Data Sources:
The CACHE Explorer provides real-time data for the gold bars backing CACHE Gold. All tracking data is hashed and broadcasted to the Ethereum blockchain to prevent data tampering, manipulation or deletion.
In terms of pricing data, any reliable and reputable oracle or feed for the spot price of gold is suitable. We can also provide our own.
We are happy to answer any additional questions the Aave community has.
We have also recently applied to be added as collateral on Maker DAO.
There are many more relevant links we would have liked to include, but this forum seems to have a limit of 5 links per post.

['Initial Discussion 2: Origination Fees'],"Hello Aave world,
Intro
I write to you today in hopes to initiate the discussion around Aave’s revenue model. The goal of this thread is to discuss how we might set the framework for effectively:

Setting the fees generated by the Aave protocol (origination fee)
Utilizing the revenues generated by the fees (incentives for dev fund, LP rewards, etc.)

Aave Protocol Fees
For the sake of aligning all people to the current state, here is a direct quote from the Aave documents:



 Aave Referral Program:

Aave is currently kickstarting governance. Origination Fees will be decided by the Aave community and are currently “paused” with a minimal low amount. You can still register for the referral program.

Each loan currently incurs a 0.0000001% origination fee.
80% of this fee is used to buy LEND tokens from the market and burn them, which reduces the monetary supply of the LEND token.
20% of this fee is redistributed to the referrers.
The referrers consist of the liquidity providers ( deposit() ) and the borrow providers ( borrow() ).
40% of this fee goes to the liquidity providers (effectively 8% of origination fee).
60% of this fee goes to the borrow providers (effectively 12% of origination fee).



Source: https://docs.aave.com/developers/integrating-aave/referral-program
From the official documentation above, it appears this is now our role as a community to put forth our best opinions on how to set fees. If I’m not mistaken, this initial 0.0000001% origination fee was set extremely low in order to bootstrap adoption. However, with $1.36B total locked value, as the 3rd highest DeFi protocol by value locked, and with the launch of $Aave Token and Governance, it seems fitting to kick off discussions now.
Pricing Strategy
The way I’d approach pricing strategy/valuations is 3-fold:


Cost Approach: What is the upkeep cost / maintenance for the Aave team? Do we have an understanding of their annual budgeting? How big of a team and how many years must they exist? The result of this annual budget costing analysis should be the revenue floor.


Value Approach: How do our users value our protocol? What exactly is our value proposition? I’d like to confirm my hypothesis with data, but I’d bet that most of our volume is based off users that want to keep exposure to an underlying asset and borrow stable-coins or wBTC. (personally, hoping for renBTC in the future ). Once these are borrowed, what do the users earn with them? Our fees must be low enough for the users to still be profitable after!

Market Approach: This is where I’ll some extra help and hope to get people’s thoughts. This is where we decide how we compete. The only thing I could find for MakerDAO was the 3.5% stability fee. Couldn’t find fee data for Compound. Aside from DeFi, with TradFi, the origination fee is between 0.5% and 1%.


Outstanding thoughts for me here:

If anybody has Compound fee data, please share
How much longer do we want to bootstrap adoption with low fee?
What can we do to further adoption of Aave?

I’d suggest a native BTC-onramp integration where a user can take BTC, mint ERC-20 BTC, deposit that into Aave, all in one transaction. RenJS is an SDK that enables this. You can see Curve as an example)


What does the Aave team think?

Don’t want to step on any toes here and would like their guidance as they likely have material, non-public information


Finally, once we have an estimate based on these 3 approaches I outlined, we can triangulate an appropriate fee (maybe by a vote based on weighted average by vote?)

Usage of Revenues
I’ll begin this section with a comment from Stani in another thread:



Initial discussion: AAVE reserve emission for safety and ecosystem incentives


I agree with @depressedape and @EmmanuelD that there should be incentives for LPs and stakers for providing safety for LPs, DeFi is about incentives in general. It’s more of a question on

the healthy balance between stakers and LPs
ensuring that there is incentive for LPs to stake their earned AAVE
ensure that LPs are interested in long-term sustainability for the protocol (that would be inline with the governance since short-term LPs would merely want faster gains)



I 100% agree with @stani that we must align the incentives with a healthy balance.
Here’s my breakdown:

$Aave stakers should receive a lion’s share of the rewards as their collateral supports the stability and security of the protocol. Currently, they (we) receive 0% of origination fees; the 400 Aave/day was set by the community in a prior thread, will end after the set period, and does not come from fees. This must change to incentivizing maintaining a threshold of Aave staked.

I believe liquidity providers should receive the next largest amount. Currently, they receive 8% of origination fees.
I’m not sure what “Borrow providers” are. This term is outside my applicable understanding of traditional finance. Currently, they receive 12% of origination fees. If this term means “Borrower”, I’d strongly recommend we don’t incentivize borrowers more than stakers or depositors. I’d actually suggest this becomes 0%. The borrower is the user with the most benefit, and it should be safe to assume they’ll be using their loan to make more money.
Last but certainly not least, we should discuss how the dev fund should be properly funded to continue the innovation that the Aave team ships

I hope this helps kick off the discussion, and I hope to hear what everybody thinks. Once we have come to a decent alignment on structure/framework, we can determine what to push forward as an official proposal. Thank you for taking the time to review my request for discussion.

['Initial Discussion 2: Origination Fees'],"Great time to start the discussion!
I definitely think we’re building one of the most incredible innovations in finance here. 
On the note of origination fees, don’t quote me but I believe Compound charges no origination fees of any kind- and I think that’s not a bad idea.
First off, should we have a noticeable origination fee, we’d be locked into “second choice” territory in regards to Compound assuming similar rates. This is a big deal, because though Aave and Compound can (and should) be in a symbiotic relationship, Aave must cement its place in the standard borrowing niche.
Another point I’d like to make is that staking in the security module provides safety for liquidity providers, not borrowers. Borrowers already pay liquidity providers through interest, I fundamentally believe the course of action to take would be to redirect a small portion of this interest generated towards stakers.
In other words, Aave remains competitive, maintains its edge in having multiple markets (see and signal your vote on my UNI-V2 liquidity token market proposal here) and simultaneously rewards those who bear the heaviest risk.
It is definitely worth noting that the security module is seriously one of Aave’s biggest selling points. Especially as more traditional finance users get onboarded on to Aave. On the broader financial spectrum, receiving more than the average 0.05% APY on what’s essentially US dollars with in-built insurance against black swans is aavesome!
In Summary
For the following two reasons, I am leaning against implementing a loan origination fee in favor of an interest-redirection model:

Compound, the biggest lending protocol in DeFi charges no origination fee (seemingly).
The safety module benefits depositing more than borrowing.

Side note, regardless of the origination fee, governance can and should enact a Dev fund and a “treasury.” I totally agree with you there.
Let me know what you think about my input. I’m not a financial expert (yet), but I just wanted to voice my opinions. Thanks again for starting this discussion!
P.S. On flash loans, I’m not sure if it’s a good idea to redirect a portion of the fee towards safety module stakers, since flash loans are essentially (almost) risk-free and only require liquidity to function. Could be a good idea to think about this too. Flash loan fees are one of Aave’s most innovative value propositions, and their fees are an important incentive for liquidity providers",51,70.2,2020-10-04

 Zer0dot:

Borrowers already pay liquidity providers through interest, I fundamentally believe the course of action to take would be to redirect a small portion of this interest generated towards stakers.


Thanks for the response, @Zer0dot! - I agree. Aave is pretty awesome.
Interesting idea. Whether we choose an origination fee % or cut a % from stakers, the fee will effectively come from the same pocket. (Please correct me if I’m wrong). On the Aave application, a borrower is a staker no matter what, right? They have to provide tokens to borrow other tokens.
I can’t speak to the implementation complexity from a technical standpoint, but from a business standpoint, we basically just have to consider which revenue stream we want to open and determine how we’d want to position ourselves in the market and brand it.
Comparing the Two
Origination Fee ($) = Principal * Origination fee (%)


Pro: Instant fee on each loan that occurs

Pro: More occurrences of fees than taking a continuous cut of staking interest (Each time you go in and out of a loan, it would generate a fee as opposed to the just one continuous fee on one principal)

Cons: Compound has no origination fees

Cons: Fee is not Continuous

Fee from the staked tokens = Staked Principal * (e)^(% interest*T)… assuming continuous compounding… New variable being T=time:


Pro: A larger principal because staked value will always be > borrowed value. This does not necessarily more fee revenue because the fee is over time with no fixed cost

Pro: Revenues could become a bit more continuous/stable and a function of locked value rather than transaction volume

Pro: Attract more borrowing by branding with no origination fee loans

Cons: Fee is not Continuous

Thought: We’d basically play market maker and win within the spread

I like your ideas, but I’m open to hearing if the overall sentiment is to keep origination fees at 0. I have 2 additional thoughts now:

I haven’t read any docs on the fee structure for flash loans. I’d be interested to add that to the above comparison
I also just remembered the stable APY fee that can be opted-in for. Does anybody know where that additional revenue goes?




 Zer0dot:

The safety module benefits depositing more than borrowing.


Doesn’t it benefit both people, though? Because the depositor/borrower is the same person? (Outside of flash loan)",46,14.2,2020-10-04
['Initial Discussion 2: Origination Fees'],"Ideally the compensation for staking goes up but it does’t necessarily have to come from origination fees.
As @Zer0dot correctly noted we want to compare favourable to other platforms and while there are many factors to compare, fees are certainly a significant one.
Adding a reward to staking proportionally to the amount of time a stake is in place might solve that without touching origination fees. The longer you stake, the more you receive above the base yield. In theory would incentivise keeping the stake in place, doesn’t touch the fees associated with borrowing from the platform and could help in addressing some of the current complaints amongst holders about the staking structure.
The incentive could come either in the form of AAVE or as a bigger portion of the eventual BAL / ETH rewards.",42,23.4,2020-10-04
['Initial Discussion 2: Origination Fees'],"Hey everyone, really good discussions !
I totally agree with you both on a needed tresaury, yearn did it and it worked pretty well, and i think we could do the same, somewhere like 500k - 1M.
This tresaury would be used for maintenance of the protocol, or help in case of a short fall event.
However, i think we can add an origination fees, even if compound doesn’t, i mean, few people are still using compound, and even less when V2 will be there …
Moreover, the referral program could be stopped (considering this is for marketing and everyone knows AAVE right now), in order to leave the DAO with 100% of the fees.
Regarding the fees, there is flash loans fees, fees on the borrow for the different markets (Aave, UniV1) and future potentials markets such as (TokeSet, Realt, Univ2, Aavegotchi and more …)
I don’t know how to define correct rate for each market in order to do some calculations, so if someone can help on this, would be amazing !
In my opinion, Aave has the ability to stay attractive and competitive despite a raise of the fees, because the available markets on aave are and will only be offered by aave.
So, to get the tresaury filled, instead of using part of the ecosystem reserve, we could use fees from borrows and flash loans. This money would be swapped to stablecoins and start compounding interests, and fees would be added until the decided amount is reached.
Once it’s good, this could create two additional revenues for stakers :

the tresaury would always generate interests, and some % could be distributed to stakers ( let’s say 50%) The other half would keep compounding to increase tresaury and interests for stakers
All the fees generated could be paid in the currency borrowed, and automatically used to buy AAVE tokens on the market and distribute it to stakers

This would increase the scarcity for aave token, and leave the ecosystem reserve fully available for the DAO, especially considering this reserve will not last forever, and so, we bet on the fact that revenues that comes from the protocol will be higher than incentive distributed right now.
So, in order to play safe, this reserve should last a couple years.
I did a quick estimation of how could be distributed this reserve over the next 6 years (could be less if the protocole generate enough revenues by then)
This takes into account rewards for stakers, rewards for LP, and a compounding bonus that could incentivise people to compound aave received and stake it all into the Safety module ( that means more security for the safety module, less dump of the rewards for the price and less aave available on the markets, so higher price)
image1023×632 76.2 KB
You may ask me why stakers get more than LP ? Because stakers are taking a bigger risk by protecting the protocole ( slashing ) compared to LP.
Moreover, the liquidity pool is a 80/20, so not much impermanent loss, and even if there is some, that should easily be covered by AAVE rewards + BAL rewards + fees anyway. Lp could also get compounding bonus if they stake the AAVE rewards.
This example of distribution is decreasing with time, and would be with a total of 2.5M AAVE, leaving 0.5M aave free.
For those 0.5M AAVE remaining, we got some ideas with @EmmanuelD :

Universal airdrop like UNI to recompense users that used aave before migration or else.
Airdrop for stakers
Burn total
Additional insurance in case of short fall event

So to resume and answer @defifrog on some points, i believe we wont need to keep boostrap adoption with low fees once there is V2, especially if L2 available.
The protocol would get a compounding tresaury, LP would get AAVE+ BAL+ Pool fees, Stakers would get AAVE + Fees from the protocol (once tresaury is complete) in form of AAVE + Part of interets generated by the tresaury.
I also like the idea of RenJs implementation a lot.
I hope this can help even if there is more than fees in this proposition made with @EmmanuelD . Thank you for taking time to review it and it can’t wait to get your opinions on these points.",43,103.6,2020-10-05

I’d also advocate for finding alternative ways to collect revenue for stakers rather than through an origination fee. Though Aave has been quite successfully up till now there will be increasing competitive pressure from e.g. Compound, even if they are lagging behind now. There should be as little friction as possible from people wanting to borrow and deposit funds on the platform.",36,12.2,2020-10-05
['Initial Discussion 2: Origination Fees'],"Thanks for your thought-out reply @defifrog! Here’s what I’ve got to say:



 defifrog:

Pro: More occurrences of fees than taking a continuous cut of staking interest (Each time you go in and out of a loan, it would generate a fee as opposed to the just one continuous fee on one principal)


I disagree with this being a benefit of implementing an origination fee. I don’t think there’s a material difference between having a fee be continuous or split, disregarding returns.
As for this pro when it comes to interest redirection:



 defifrog:

Pro: Revenues could become a bit more continuous/stable and a function of locked value rather than transaction volume


I do want to point out that interest earned is proportional to the amount borrowed, thus, revenues are tied to the borrowed amount. Though this doesn’t have to do with transaction volume necessarily, as more gets borrowed, more fees can get collected in both models.



 defifrog:




 Zer0dot:

The safety module benefits depositing more than borrowing.


Doesn’t it benefit both people, though? Because the depositor/borrower is the same person? (Outside of flash loan)


Absolutely! A borrower is always a depositor, but a depositor is not necessarily a borrower. My thought process is angled at not making depositor-borrowers pay for the insurance of pure depositors. You know what I mean? In other words, by redirecting a portion of all interest, we’re only taking from the insured side of the equation.
Overall, I think we’re on the same page! There’s a lot of discussion to be had, good things take time after all.



 drew:

Interesting points on other opportunities to direct fees toward AAVE stakers. I’m curious if an official proposal has been put forth on where fees from Flash Loans will be directed? Are they currently being used somewhere?


Hey Drew! Welcome to the governance forum!
To answer your question, as it stands right now the flash loan fees are 100% directed to depositors in the appropriate currency.",37,27.4,2020-10-05
['Initial Discussion 2: Origination Fees'],"Thanks @defifrog for opening the discussion on fees and also for others for contributing. Good insights from @Zer0dot and @Dydymoon.
I think the main treasury currently is the Aave Reserve that holds 3 mm AAVE tokens that can be used to incentivise various actions, such as there is now the 400 AAVE per day distribution to boostrap the Safety Module (currently there is around 2 700 stakers with 1,3 MM AAVE, quite nice in terms of decentralization: https://etherscan.io/address/0x4da27a545c0c5b758a6ba100e3a049001de870f5). The Safety Module indeed is a really good advantage within the Aave Protocol as it allows risk transfer from depositors to protocol governance and thus helps adoption.
Fees are something that could be added pretty much anytime if the governance decides so, for example could be during or right after the v2 launch that is coming quite soon. In terms of the fees, I think the fees should not decrease the ability to move capital since it would reduce the amount of innovation that other devs would build on top of the Aave Protocol. Instead, the fees should encourage traction such as changing loan position by swapping collateral, loan currency, interest rate and so on.
The issue with origination fee is that once you pay it, you would not want to change your position again since you would have to pay it once more. Instead if a borrower could freely change position on weekly/monthly basis depending on the market rates that would create more monetization events and allows to move capital freely.
The v2 has quite many ways to collect fees, for example part of the interest could go to stakers, each collateral swap, loan currency and interest rate swap or part of the liquidations. Even if you close your loan position by paying with your collateral that could be a place for monetization for protocol fees.
Fees going to mainly for stakers makes sense since the stakers are the ones that are taking the active risk of the protocol and LPs are receiving interest rates, but also could in the future receive Ecosystem Incentives (EI) for providing liquidity in form of AAVE. LPs should be encouraged to stake the AAVE into SM so that both stakers and LPs incentives are aligned towards safety.
The dev fund is an interesting idea especially to get more community contributors involved building the protocol and new features on top. Additionally, from that fund or separate fund there could be a decentralized grants program as well. The main treasury can be the Aave Reserve that collects all fees and allocates to places however the governance decides (stakers, dev fund, grant fund etc). It’s all up to the governance and also additional ways to embrace adoption via fee distribution is highly encouraged. Quite often the focus has been on devs building. What about non-devs and also community members who invent new features or bring new ideas in front of the community? How could the community reward everyone that brings special effort? Some thoughts.

['[ARC] Implement a UNI-V2 Liquidity Pool Token Market: Initial Discussion'],"Hey folks!
I’m currently in the process of submitting an official AIP to garner support for the implementation of a UNI-V2 money market in the Aave protocol. As it stands, the only two markets present in the protocol are the Aave and UNI-V1 markets. The UNI-V1 market is highly outdated, totaling under 300,000 $USD in total value locked at the time of this writing.
Reasoning
Implementing a UNI-V2 liquidity token market would allow the deposit of UNI-V2 tokens into the protocol for use as collateral. This would benefit the DeFi market and stimulate the overall ecosystem, potentially unlocking upwards of a billion dollars worth of new collateral.
As previously discussed, there is no additional risk to existing Aave markets included in this AIP. There is also no negative gas cost repercussion either. The implementation of this AIP may come after the (very exciting!) launch of Aave V2. My goal is only to garner community sentiment and get the ball rolling.
Risk Profiles
Though I’m not an expert (yet), we do have risk profiles created for the following pairs on UNI-V1:

DAI/ETH
LEND/ETH
LINK/ETH
USDC/ETH
MKR/ETH
SETH/ETH

Correct me if I’m wrong, but the risk profiles have not substantially changed for these specific pairs. Further development, study and discussion in potential pairs to implement as well as associated risks is necessary.
Due to the migration, the implementation of LEND or AAVE UNI-V2 tokens as collateral may end up being against the community’s interest in promoting active governance. I would recommend implementing the DAI/ETH, LINK/ETH and USDC/ETH pairs to begin with. Further pairs such as WBTC/ETH and USDT/ETH should also be considered.

We’re long-term believers in this space and are deeply committed to the success of Aave and the broader ecosystem. We’re optimistic that DeFi will eventually attract the masses that borrow/lend in order to finance real-world commerce, such as the purchase of goods and services on Origin decentralized stores and marketplaces.
In addition, regardless of whether OGN is added as a supported asset on Aave and subsequent proposal, this process will be a strong example of how decentralized governance can work in action. Just like DeFi has composability, we believe decentralized governance should have composability, and this will be a great way to test the chaining of two governance votes together.
About Origin
Origin is building a platform for blockchain-powered commerce. Origin’s goal is to enable true peer-to-peer commerce by disintermediating middlemen to reduce or remove fees, improve censorship resistance, and to reduce platform risk for developers and merchants.
Origin was founded in mid-2017 in San Francisco and the 20-person team includes one of the founders of PayPal, the first engineer at YouTube, and former engineering managers from Google and Dropbox. Origin conducted token sales in 2017 and 2018, raising $38.1M, led by Pantera Capital with participation from Foundation Capital, Kyber, QCP Capital, and Alexis Ohanian (co-founder, Reddit), Steve Chen (founder, YouTube), and Garry Tan (partner, Y Combinator).
The Origin Marketplace is live on the Ethereum mainnet and our decentralized stores are used by many well-known players in the crypto community including Brave, Solana, Contentos and Kyber.
About OGN
Origin Token (OGN) is a multi-purpose ERC-20 token created to fuel the growth of the Origin network. OGN enables an affiliate/advertising platform, incentivizes end-users to use and share the platform, and transfers value between buyers and sellers as a payment token. In addition, OGN will be used for on-chain governance purposes in the future.

Potential concerns
Liquidity
We recognize that liquidity is important for the security of the platform. OGN is currently listed on top exchanges like Binance and Huobi and is currently being considered for listing on Coinbase . Daily trading volume has ranged between $5M to $133M, with the average over the last 30 days coming in slightly over $17M. We’re aware of the concerns that have been raised in previous proposals concerning the low liquidity of wBTC and the increased risk for liquidations. While we recognize that OGN would be on the lower end of the liquidity spectrum, we have a couple of orders of magnitude more liquidity than wBTC.
Other platforms
Composability is one of the most interesting parts of DeFi, and OGN is already available on other DeFi platforms like Uniswap, Kyber and Balancer

Custom functionality
The OGN contract has a custom approveAndCallWithSender function that is based on ERC-827 that allows OGN to be approved and transferred to a whitelist of addresses in a single step. We added this function to improve the user experience for users of the Origin marketplace. While adding complexity, we do not believe it adds any security considerations for our token or the security of Compound.
Admin rights
The OGN contract is owned by a 5 of 8 Gnosis mutisig contract which has been audited by OpenZeppelin, ConsenSys, Origin’s team, and others. While we can’t reveal the identities of the keyholders for security reasons, we can share that the keys are held by individuals with close ties to the company. Our keyholders have been instructed to manually double-check every proposal for accuracy before granting approval. The keyholders are highly intelligent and ethical individuals. My cofounder, Matt, and I have known and worked with many of them for years and we trust them to protect the best interests of all token holders.
Like many other widely used tokens, we included the OpenZeppelin libraries that enable minting, burning and pausing. We included this functionality solely out of a desire to reserve optionality in an unknown future. We have no current plans to use it and have put careful processes in place to prevent both accidental and intentional abuse. Even as founders acting together, Matt and I do not have enough control to execute those owner functions on our own. We recognize that burning any externally owned tokens could do irreparable harm to our reputation and value of our token. As a result, this external burning capability would only be used under extreme circumstances and with community support.
While we’re not ready to revoke ownership of our token contract altogether as the network is still developing, we are open to adding a Compound-inspired timelock in front of any admin function calls if that will make a difference for the community.

Initial (very early) Discussion: Tokenised commodities as collateral on AAVE Governance


    AAVE currently supports a number of tokenised fiat currencies as collateral. In this same vein, would users benefit from being able to make use of their tokenised commodities (such as gold) as collateral? 
I believe that currencies such as tokenised gold could be a useful form of collateral for AAVE users. Although tokenised gold can be controversial and at the very least a bit polarising, I believe that in the future, the addition of a gold-backed token as collateral on AAVE could be beneficial…

I completely disagree - if there is a mistake or error in the protocol and a user loses funds, the stakers in the PoS do not hand out cash/tokens/equity to directly cover their loss. Likewise if I own any sort of equity and a customer loses cash, the shareholder does not directly provide the customer their shares to cover his/her loss (the company pays for this loss if redeemable). Of course, if there is a harmful bug in a PoS protocol or mistake made by a traditional equity company the equity holder or staker can lose value from depreciation of the token or share value from lack of confidence in the market etc., but my main point is that they do not insure the user with their own shares/tokens - so this model is entirely different. I think it might be better to have a medium article or well articulated explanation from the team on exactly how the ShortFall events may occur (and why they may occur) and summarise the remoteness of them happening.
I am not saying that that stakers in the SM should not be rewarded handsomly, they should as they are putting their capital at risk. However I think token holders should be able to contribute in a less risky manner which also provides some fee generation to them to make up for lack of token burn in v2 (correct me if I am wrong on that but as I understand it the token burn mechanism has been removed too).
Being blunt, I am not sure how well the token will accrue value if (i) inflation is added (which i am fine with here, it is sensible), (ii) token burning feature removed, and (iii) they cannot get any rewards from protocol fees unless they stake in the SM.",45,44.0,2020-09-04

['Aavenomics Questions'],"Hi everyone,
After waiting anxiously for months, the docs are finally here! What a pleasure it was reading them.
As always when releasing new information, questions start popping up. After checking the Aave discord, I saw team members forwarding questions towards this forum. So here I am. Starting off myself.
Nr 1: It is made very clear that the Genesis Team will code the AIP’s. Sure, the community will discuss it before hand, and approve it afterwards, but still, there is explicit wording that the Genesis Team will be between. Other teams in this space often say that anyone can implement an approved proposal in their project, if it is voted in. Why the emphasis on having the Genesis Team doing it?
Not saying I don’t like the team, it just seems unnecessary to have the focus on one team, in such a decentralized project.
Nr2: “ In case the SM is not able to cover all of the deficit incurred, the Protocol Governance can trigger an ad-hoc  Recovery Issuance  event. In such a scenario, new AAVE is issued and sold in an open auction for market price prioritizing the  Backstop Module  .”
Does this mean creating new AAVE out of thin air?
Nr3: “ The Safety Module is built on top of existing AMM technologies. An 80% AAVE/20% ETH liquidity pool using Balancer will be used to provide benefits in terms of market depth for the AAVE token and earnings from locking AAVE. This also extends to BAL tokens and trading fees on top of the SI and protocol fees, while reducing the impact of a Shortfall Event on the AAVE token itself.”
""Since Balancer Labs is distributing BAL governance tokens to liquidity providers, having the SM liquidity in Balancer enables the users to receive BAL tokens on top of trading fees, protocol fees and SI rewards.”
It’s quite a move to include Balancer in the design like this. What if Balancer quite/breaks/gets hacked. This introduces new risks quite vital to the AAVE system. It also means stakers will earn BAL. I guess it is a seen as a risk worth taken? I am curious to see what the community will think.
Nr4: am I correct in seeing burnings are no longer part of the tokenomics? Fees will now completly be used for incentives?",108,1176.6,2020-07-30
['Aavenomics Questions'],"This is a good set of questions and require an equally articulate set of answers.


There is explicit reference to the Genesis team as the team who will take care of implementing the proposals in the initial phase of the governance. This is done on purpose to bootstrap the first phase of the governance decentralization. Although i personally love compound governance (which you are implicitly referring to as the one that allows anybody with enough voting power to submit executable proposals), their model works because their governance focus on small parameters change which don’t necessarily requires large change to the protocol, the goal here is to make sure that if a big change to the Aave protocol is proposed as an AIP, the genesis team is involved in reviewing code and in the implementation of the smart contract proposal for security purposes. The Genesis team is not the main developer going forward but is a facilitator to implement big changes to the protocol while being compliant to the existing code base during a time where everyone gets familiar with it. What it means is that anyone can propose changes as AIPs with very big upgrades to the protocol but following a particular process. Once those smart contract are audited and reviewed the Genesis team will facilitate the implementation and put the contract to the vote, without opinion on the content of the proposal but, as a smart contract implementation facilitator. Eventually the Genesis team will be deprecated as risk and audit team are incentivized to fully contribute to the protocol but it would not be smart to not take advantage of the in-depth knowledge acquired by those who architecture the protocol for the sake of apparent decentralization.


Correct. Similar to the recovery procedure of Maker, the last resort to rescue the protocol is an one time emission of AAVE to cover the debt. That’s extremely important to guarantee that even if the protocol isn’t completely covered by the Safety Module, there is still margin to avoid having the protocol completely underwater. Although some holders might turn their nose up at it, it’s important to understand that if there isn’t Aave protocol, there isn’t AAVE. Eventually this comes as a great incentive for the community to take proper governance decisions and avoid unnecessary risks.


To understand this choice it’s important first to understand how Balancer works under the hood. Balancer architecture is quite different compared to, for example, Aave or compound: When we say “Deposit to Balancer” what we actually say is “deposit into a very self contained contract, separated by the other ones, that has risk related to that contract itself and the tokens contained in it”. So it’s substantially different from providing liquidity to Aave, where all the liquidity is shared. In the case of the safety module, the Balancer pool will be a specific pool contract, customized by us and under the control of the Aave governance, that will be also audited by us prior to the deployment. So can be considered by all means a contract that belongs to the Aave ecosystem and that leverages the Balancer technology. This is a very important aspect to understand - there is no intrinsic risk of “Balancer getting hacked” rather the “Contract where AAVE are deposited getting hacked”. It’s worth to note that of course we reviewed internally the Balancer contract that we are going to use. Their pool contract is relatively easy to understand and with little additional smart contract risk.
As for the benefits of having part of the stake as an AMM, i would suggest the proof of liquidity paper https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2020/5/22/proof-of-liquidity that very well explains how pure staking systems suffer from price manipulation, low market depth and extreme volatility. That is of course, besides the additional yield farming and fees that stakers will unlock.
Also mind that the implementation is not tied to Balancer - it will also possible deposit plain AAVE, that will be locked in the Aave SM contract, or in the future add multiple AMMs underneath - it’s very flexible.


burning will remain active and the Aave governance will decide how to handle the fees.

Glad to see the thought process is as I hoped it to be. Just a follow up question. This facilitating. Could, in theory, this be done by others?

But just trying to understand what the facilitating practically means.


Yeah it reminded me of MKR as well. I am super excited to see how much value the safety module will hold, with the incentives being there.


I must admit, I did not know Balancer could be used in this way. Very interesting. I know I could ask this/find this in the Balancer community, but, is this how all Balancer pools work? All stand alone contracts? Pretty cool!

I understand the ER now is the one that gives incentives to the LP, and not by the market anymore (as it is today), is that right?

By incentives as of today, do you mean the interest paid to those providing liquidity? The interest will continue to be paid as it already is, however the ecosystem incentives being paid to liquidity providers would be in addition to the interest paid.

The fees to the SM, but don’t they also have to go to the ER to keep the incentives running?

They would if this extra incentive for liquidity providers was going to be endless (which isn’t good for inflation) - but in this other thread it’s discussed that the additional allocation is for a year worth of incentivizing liquidity, of course this incentive is on top of the interest rates for depositing. So there would be no need for the fees to feed back into the ER.

If the fees are in the native token, how are they converted into Aave or eth for them to be usable in the SM or Backstop module?

So with the SM, the fees aren’t necessarily being used to contribute to the SM itself but the fees are what is being used to incentivize users to deposit into the Safety Module, which uses AAVE/ETH. Those who deposit are taking on a risk in the instance of a shortfall event, as such are rewarded with fees and part of the safety incentives from the ecosystem reserve. For the fee itself, the governance will be able to choose what token it’s in, ETH/stablecoin.

I understand that Aave is only emitted when rescuing the protocol. Is there another way the system could increase supply?

Other than increasing supply to rescue the protocol, governance has full control over the token so it could increase it if there was a reason to that aligned with the token holders in the future.",34,21.8,2020-08-27

['Liquidity rewards for smart contract insurance providers'],"In the discussion thread here, we are discussion allocations for AAVE emission




Initial discussion: AAVE reserve emission for safety and ecosystem incentives Governance


    This thread is to bootstrap the discussion about the initial distribution of the AAVE reserve for safety and ecosystem growth. As readers might already know, 3M AAVE will be allocated in the reserve, and these 3M will need to be properly distributed between the Safety Module (to safeguard the protocol against shortfall) and the protocol liquidity providers to incentivize growth. 
The team proposal covers the first year of AAVE emission, and is defined as follows: 

685 AAVE/day allocated for the…
  



685 AAVE/day allocated for the Ecosystem Incentives (“Liquidity mining”) 250K AAVE allocated for the first year


Proposal tldr: Provide 2% of yearly liquidity mining rewards for stakers participating in providing liquidity for Nexus Mutual smart contract insurance (to learn more about Nexus Mutual).
Why? At the moment, there is about over $17.8M USD worth of smart contract insurance cover being taken out on Nexus Mutual, and 7.8% of that has been taking out by Aave. The hypothesis here is that there is a large untapped audience of potential Aave users (mostly whales) who would be willing to use Aave - but ONLY if there was insurance for their staked funds.
Currently Aave’s safety module covers economic risk but not smart contract security risk.

-> Aave funds are insured -> safety and protection -> more willingness to risk funds in DeFi/Aave
It could be potentially a really positively self-reinforcing cycle.
What happens when you provide greater incentives for $NXM holders to stake on $NXM?

More stakers will opt to on NXM
More individuals will want to become $NXM stakers to earn $AAVE alongside $NXM rewards
More capacity for smart contract security for Aave users

How much to dedicate to rewarding $NXM stakers?
Rewarding liquidity providers is mostly sound but there should be experiments in other ways of driving both supply and demand side liquidity for Aave. Incentivising insurance is another way.
1 Aave = (100 $LEND) = roughly $36.3036 USD worth at the moment
2% of 250k yearly liquidity incentives Aave = 5k $AAVE
5k AAVE = $181,518 USD worth of Aave
There are currently $2,095,636 worth of NXM staked securing $1.4M worth of Aave.
A 2% inflation would roughly represent an extra 10% APR on top of the current NXM rewards.
I believe that all this needs to do is incentivoze merely $2M more in $NXM staked into the platform to provide $2M+ worth of liquidity back into the platform (about 10x returns in incentive:reward ratio)",81,1611.2,2020-08-06

 Institutions stay away from DeFi / yield farming due to the inability to size risk. The risk for institutions is the loss of all funds

Allocating a % of yield to an insurance pool automatically could give institutions the ability size risk and put capital to work

Game-changer? https://t.co/3kAFjvbL3x
Tyler Reynolds @tbr90We’re definitely going to see “insurance mining” where protocols reward @NexusMutual underwriters. 

It’s one of the things I’ve been thinking about with my side project, @HackAlertIO.

“Less rewards” is a spectrum. If a more secure platform brings in larger players (“whales”) then the overall pool of rewards goes up dramatically. Focus right now should be on sustainability and scale.

I would love to see a native integration for insurance inside AAVE.
Borrowers can currently borrow either with variable or fixed rates.
I could see a world where there is an option for deposits to either be insured (lower or negative yield if deposit as collateral) or un-insured. In this world:

AAVE purchases coverage and sets a smart contract pool as recipient
If there is a bug, this SC receives DAI
Anyone that had opt-in and paid for insurance before payment in DAI could claim automatically from that pool. This could be extremely fluid, like a block-by-block coverage / pay as you go.

['Liquidity rewards for smart contract insurance providers'],"@nxm_chad thanks for opening the thread, the community appreciates that kind of gesture. It’s amazing to see good utilization of nexus for Aave deposits and it’s a great way to transfer risk. The planned Aavenomics will also take into consideration smart contract risk or any risk the Aave Governance seems important to be included for the long-term safety of the protocol. However, I think it’s important to diversify the risk always and allow users to be able to take nexus cover, that will help to decrease the overall risk within the protocol. Currently, nexus does not scale to the above billion factor but would be beneficial to depositors who need that extra cover.
I think adding wNXM/NXM might be something that the Aave community would appreciate.",29,60.8,2020-08-23

['What happens to the referral program?'],"Same as with the current burning of the LEND from the borrow origination fees, I agree it is a quite important topic to discuss.
However, this affects more the Aave markets and their economic dynamics than the aavenomics themselves, as the referral program is distributing the fees in the currencies they are received.
Initially, there is no limitation (technical at least) to still keep a fee of some nature from the markets to referrals, but I suppose it depends a lot on other discussions/proposals concerning the relation between markets/aavenomics too.",59,11.8,2020-07-30
['What happens to the referral program?'],@Ciro.Timvi i think would be very cool to format this thread as an initial proposal to bootstrap the discussion - it’s a very important topic,59,16.8,2020-07-30
['What happens to the referral program?'],"@Ciro.Timvi Its not sure that burning will stop yet, it will depend on what is decided to do with the fees.
I think there is a need for aproposal to make overall change to the fee capture and redistribution structure, it might not need to come from the borrowed fund. There is many other part where fees can be taken.
Integrators which used to be rewarded by the ref program might still get a cut of the fees if governance decide to keep incentivizing them, although they will already receive the AAVE EI corresponding to their users deposits.
But like Emilio said I think this deserve a whole thread on integrators incentives.",56,31.2,2020-07-30
