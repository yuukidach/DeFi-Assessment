['alETH Return Program'],"
We’re live! You can now send back your ETH/alETH using our website.
What happened?
On Wednesday June 16th, the Alchemix alETH contract encountered a bug with the harvest function, erroneously repaying all the system alETH debt. Borrowers were free to withdraw their ETH that was supposed to be collateral for their alETH. In effect, all borrowers of alETH before the time of the incident were given free alETH. This “reverse-rug” resulted in the alETH system being undercollateralized by 2262 ETH.
The Return Program:
After the incident, we received several inquiries from users on how and where they could return their accidental airdrops. The team was impressed by this show of support for the project.  We are humbly requesting the users that benefited from this incident return the alETH they minted, or an equal amount of ETH. In turn, the Alchemix DAO will airdrop you an equivalent amount (not value) of ALCX for any ETH or alETH returned.
What to do next?
Visit the ‘Return’ page at https://app.alchemix.fi/. Here you’ll be greeted with a message that tells you how much free credit you were issued as a result of the bug.
How to become a true Alchemix Legend?
Underneath the input box you’ll see a slider which allows you to set how much ETH or alETH you would like to send in. If you set it to 100% you’ll see that the ‘Become a Legend’ phrase is presented to you.

Don’t worry, if you want to return ETH or alETH using multiple transactions then the webpage will account for your outstanding balance.
What about this NFT we keep hearing about?
In addition to being proof of your Legendary status, the NFT will endow you with yet-to-be-determined functionality in the Alchemix DAO.
Upon the conclusion of the return program period, the Legendary NFT will be claimable, via POAP, for those who return their full balance.
Can anyone donate ETH or alETH even if they weren’t reverse rugged? 
As a platform we will always recognise the generosity of contributors of all types.
If someone has not benefited from the incident but would still like to donate, they are free to do so and will also get the ALCX airdrop after the program concludes. We absolutely do not expect anyone to do this, however we have received several such offers, and any such donations would play an active role in strengthening the Alchemix protocol.  Your contributions will be remembered.
I still have ETH deposited in the Alchemist contract, what should I do?
If you had deposited ETH in the alETH Alchemist and taken an alETH loan, your loan is now paid off and you should be able to withdraw your initial deposit. If you took out an alETH loan after the incident and it shows you still have debt, that will have to be repaid before withdrawing from the contract.
When we relaunch alETH Alchemix next week, it will require depositing into a new contract. You can withdraw from the current contract at any time, but operations will not continue on it.
If you have any questions about becoming a Legend please feel free to pop by in our Discord channel and you’ll find plenty of motivated Alchemist’s ready to help steer you through it.

['事件报告- 06162021'],"大约在UTC时间上午12:30，Alchemix alETH 金库的一些用户发现即使之前以 4:1 的抵押比率借入了 alETH，但他们却没有未偿债务。 除此之外，近 2,000 ETH 的债务上限被释放以再次铸造新的 alETH。
Alchemix 团队注意到了这个问题并立即采取了行动。 新 alETH 的铸造暂时暂停，直到问题被查明并提供解决方案。 在Yearn 和Alchemix 的共同努力下，该事件得到了快速有效的处理。
根本原因分析
一个alETH 金库的部署脚本问题意外创建了另外的金库，然后用户在金库数组中使用了错误的索引，导致未完成的奖励计算错误，迫使transmuter资金全部发送以偿还用户债务 .
导致这种情况的收益可以在 tx id 0x38ecc8363836e43aca99d994bb9325a8f3770d7a1d1fffd62c82cf5230525836 下检查
我们花了多长时间才终止这个问题？
在 Alchemix 团队开始调查问题后 15 分钟，alETH 的铸币功能暂停执行（tx id 0xc4dac8a2df7c34b1ca6e886a5447bab249518b503551b06828ba42fdc5fab802），事件报告的工作是在事件首次曝光后大约 2.5 小时开始的。
用户资金是否丢失？
没有。个人用户可以提取他们所有的 ETH，当前合约中的任何其他人也可以。 损失仅限于 alETH 的支持者。 这意味着，用户被允许提取他们不应该提取的抵押品。
事件对Yearn有影响吗？
没有。他们的保险库运行正常，Yearn 没有遭受任何损失。
现有资金是否有再次发生这种情况的风险？
不会。我们将重新部署一个新的 Transmuter，它可以在索引 0 处正确部署单个保险库，以确保不会再次发生这种情况。 我们还将部署一个新的 Alchemix Vault，它将清除当前合约中的错误状态。
我们的安全措施如何避免这种情况变得更糟？
保守的初始债务上限
只允许多重签名地址调用收获功能
在查看新流程时勤于验证结果
我们将如何解决这个问题？
首先，我们知道自己拥有 DeFi 中最出色的社区。 这是一个不争的事实，因此我们征询：如果你想支持协议、DAO 和开发者，请考虑将在此期间获得的任何多余的 ETH 分配给新的 Transmuter，以允许它支持其产生未偿还的贷款（你可能仍然拥有）。 未来几天将创建一个入口来促进它。 这将大大有助于纠正 alETH 的不足，并且对 DAO 的财务影响会小得多。 那些选择这样做的人将在未来得到应有的认可。 虽然我们现在不能说这将采取什么形式，但我们可以保证你不会被忽视。
在此之后，为了使系统恢复偿付能力，我们计划执行以下操作：
暂时增加协议费用，这将产生额外收入以填补空白。 该收入将直接进入 Transmuter 以支持 alETH 代币
通过将金库中的一些 ETH 添加到 Transmuter 以向 alETH 添加实时的支持，这是一个小的飞跃
从国库中为 ETH 出售一些 DAI 并将其添加到 Transmuter
在撰写本文时，alETH 支持目前的缺口为 -2,688.634。 目前的价格约为 653 万美元。
我们感谢 Alchemix 和更广泛的加密社区今天的大力支持。 加入我们的 Discord 并在 Twitter 上关注我们以获取更多更新。

['Incident Report - 06162021'],"Update June 19th: https://forum.alchemix.fi/public/d/146-legendary-aleth-returners
Check out the linked post above to know how the returning of ETH/alETH will work once it becomes available.

At roughly 12:30 PM UTC some users of the Alchemix alETH vault discovered they had no outstanding debt even though they previously borrowed alETH at a 4:1 collateral ratio. In addition to this, the debt ceiling of almost 2,000 ETH was freed up to mint new alETH again.
The Alchemix team noticed this issue and got all hands on deck immediately. The minting of new alETH was paused temporarily until the issue was pinpointed and a solution could be produced. The incident was quickly and efficiently dealt with in a collaborative effort between Yearn and Alchemix.
Root Cause Analysis
An issue with the deployment script of the alETH vault accidentally created additional vaults, the Alchemist then used the wrong index in the array of vaults which caused the outstanding rewards to be calculated wrong, forcing the transmuter funds to be sent entirely to pay off user debts.
The harvest that caused this can be inspected under tx id 0x38ecc8363836e43aca99d994bb9325a8f3770d7a1d1fffd62c82cf5230525836
How long did it take until we had stopped the issue?
~ 15 minutes after Alchemix team started looking into the issue a pause on the mint function for alETH was executed (tx id 0xc4dac8a2df7c34b1ca6e886a5447bab249518b503551b06828ba42fdc5fab802), the work on the incident report was started about 2.5 hours after the incident first came to light.
Were user funds lost?
No. Individual users could withdraw all of their ETH, and so can anyone else currently in the contract. The loss is limited to the backing of alETH only. Meaning, users were allowed to withdraw collateral they shouldn't have been.
Did the incident affect Yearn?
No. Their vault was functioning appropriately and Yearn did not suffer any losses.
Are existing funds at risk of this happening again?
No. We are going to redeploy a new Transmuter that correctly deploys a single vault at index 0 to ensure that this can not happen again. We will also deploy a new Alchemix Vault, which will clear out the maligned state of the current contract.
How did our security measures avoid this being worse?
Conservative initial debt ceiling
Only allow multisig addresses to call harvest
Being diligent in verifying results when looking through new processes
How are we going to put this right?
First of all, we know we have the most amazing community in DeFi. This is an indisputable fact, so we are asking: If you would like to support the protocol, the DAO, and the devs, please consider distributing any excess ETH gained during this time to the new Transmuter, to allow it to back the outstanding loans that it created (and you are likely still holding). A portal will be created in the next few days to facilitate this. This will go a long way towards correcting the alETH shortfall and will impact DAO's treasury much less. Those that choose to do this will be duly recognized in the future. While we can't say what form this shall take at this time, we can promise you will not be ignored.
After this, in order to return the system to solvency we plan to do the following:
Temporarily increase the protocol fee which will generate additional revenue towards filling the gap. That revenue will go directly into the Transmuter to add backing to alETH tokens
A small jumpstart by adding some of the ETH in the treasury to the Transmuter to add instant backing to alETH
Selling some DAI from the treasury for ETH and adding that to the Transmuter
At the time of this writing alETH backing currently has a -2,688.634 short fall. At current price that is about 6.53m USD.
We thank the Alchemix and the wider crypto community for their tremendous outpouring of support today. Join us in Discord and follow us on Twitter for more updates."
['[AIP-26] Alchemix Fuse Pool'],"One way in which Alchemix could add another use case with minimal strain on the devs, who are working hard on V2, is for us to utilize the dope product that is Rari’s Fuse pool by creating a custom Alchemix pool. For those that don’t know, Fuse is basically a customizable fork of compound. We could utilize a custom pool to create a new way to borrow and back alUSD. The treasury could mint alUSD, let’s say $5 to $10 million (which would be about 1/60th and 1/30th of the current supply of alUSD respectively), and create a custom fuse pool in which allows users to deposit collateral like ETH, sOHM, and others chosen by the team and community, which would be used to borrow this minted alUSD and alETH once oracles are developed. At the time of mint, this alUSD would be technically be unbacked, yet the alUSD couldn’t go into circulation unless a user deposits the collateral we approved at an overcollateralized level chosen by the community then pays to borrow the alUSD. We would basically be borrowing the DAI model. This overcollateralization would make the alUSD backed at the time of borrowing and would diversify the backing of alUSD which is beneficial to it as a general DeFi stablecoin in my opinion. The borrow interest on the alUSD would insure that people always paid back more alUSD than they borrowed. The Alchemix treasury could also take in the interest of these loans along with any liquidation fees to continue to build the treasury and add more diversity to the treasury. I’m very much of the opinion that a treasury should be as diversified as possible and owning stablecoins are a great way to do that. As we have seen with sOHM in other pools, the demand is very much there for a borrowable stablecoin at reasonable rates, and we could get the collateralization ratio and borrow rates to our liking for what’s best for Alchemix and borrowers alike. There is a possibility that we could further our build upon partnership with Olympus with this pool as well. We can target an 80% utilization rate where interest raises in a gradual slope until the 80% utilization rate, and then goes exponential. Since it's not my strong suit, I'll leave more loan specifics up to the hive mind.
 
This custom pool would provide alUSD with more utility and spread it across DeFi more greatly. It would also diversify the backing, so it’s not so heavily built upon by DAI. If this is effective, we could add other al collateral types to the pool in the future, and it could be a great way to get additional revenue for the treasury.
 
Unfortunately, I won’t be around for a bit after posting this, so I will have to ghost my own proposal. I trust you all, my fellow community members, with it. "
['[AIP-26] Alchemix Fuse Pool'],"RogueItachi 
This is a bit of a stretch and would probably involve a lot more discussion + negotiation from the core team but it popped in my head after seeing the snapshot announcement.
But how would we feel about doing a combined Fuse Pool with another protocol or two? That would mean liquidity for the joint assets comes from multiple communities expanding the reach. It would also symbolically add to partnerships without any real binding commitments at the protocol level. Defi 2.0 projects are frens and stronger together,  Olympus would have been an obvious choice if they didn't already have their own pool.
Think D4 saddle pool as a kind of loose analogy. Maybe turn off lending of ALCX and any other governance tokens to make it mildly more difficult to short.
Definitely would be a thought for later even if people do like the idea. No clue how much negotiation it would take behind the scenes from the team and I don't think any of us want to delay v2 for any reason at this point.
"
['[AIP-26] Alchemix Fuse Pool'],"What is the advantage to a user to borrowing alUSD this way compared to minting DAI and transmuting the DAI to mint alUSD? Just fewer steps and less gas? A different spread of collateral options than what Maker supports? The point you raise that I most agree with is that the treasury should be diversified to protect the alUSD peg. That is what the devs are focused on most anyway with v2. I dislike the principal of minting unbacked alUSD in any form. I'd rather we just raise the debt ceiling, mint the alUSD using treasury DAI, and use that DAI as the seed money for this pool if we're going to. Yes it's less capital efficient but unbacked alAssets are a schelling fence I'd prefer not to cross."
['[AIP-26] Alchemix Fuse Pool'],"LogrisTheBard I think the point would be allowing more collateral options to borrow alUSD with little effort from devs. This would lower the barrier-to-entry for alUSD and therefore spread it further into the community. Not saying i’m for or against the idea, but that is the gist of it I think."
['[AIP-26] Alchemix Fuse Pool'],"LogrisTheBard I don't think the DAO has enough DAI to mint the amount of alUSD asked for here. However, I'm wondering if we can allow users to deposit their alUSD as liquidity to be lent? Then we wouldn't need to mint as much alUSD (just an initial amount to seed the pool), and users would have another place to use their alUSD - win-win. "
['[AIP-26] Alchemix Fuse Pool'],"LogrisTheBard I think one important thing to know is that since the alUSD won't be in circulation until it is borrowed from an overcollateralized position, this isn't quite the same thing as ""printing alUSD"". For reference, FEI and MakerDAO are doing the same thing with rari and aave respectively.
The advantage over doing this in the alchemist contract is that in Alchemix, only DAI (and later more stables) can borrow alUSD. Whereas in the rari fuse pool, we could have eth, wbtc, and other collateral types, which would turn it into a mini makerDAO of sorts, and expand the ways in which people can acquire alUSD.
FWIW, I'm in favor of rolling this out with a small amount -- no more than 5m alUSD. Then we can collect data on it to see what, if any, side effects it has on the Alchemix system.
Also, it is important to note, that since Alchemix v1 prohibits smart contracts from interacting with it, then it would have to be managed by an EOA instead of a multisig, and that is a whole can of worms I do not want to open."
['[AIP-26] Alchemix Fuse Pool'],"I would explore both the options of creating an alchemix DAO-owned pool with more conservative collateral ratios than the current most popular fuse pools , & also providing to some of the existing pools, personally would prefer the less risky ones like Olympus party versus some of the riskiest ones for Alchemix to mint & lend into.
This would also be a great opportunity to launch a pool with a plugin that stakes ALCX in the background and lets people borrow against their ALCX without losing on the ALCX APR. "
['[AIP-26] Alchemix Fuse Pool'],"I'm a bit conflicted on this proposal. On the one hand, I think it's a great idea to have a DAO-owned Fuse pool that would give alUSD another use case and that would effectively become another income stream. Depending on the collateral types this could be quite a good move (especially if we include sOHM which has crazy interest fees in the other pools).
On the other hand, even though this alUSD is not technically unbacked (since users need to put up collateral), it is unbacked from the transmuter's perspective. Meaning: there won't be any DAI in the system/vaults to act as a backstop and to guard peg stability. So launching this pool could potentially put a strain on the alUSD peg, since it would take longer to transmute alUSD to DAI.
So it might makes sense to do a trial run with a small amount (maximum 5m, but I would say even less than that), but we need to be conscious that this is not a free lunch and that it could have potential negative impacts on the protocol."
['[AIP-26] Alchemix Fuse Pool'],"0xFelix 
I agree with your point, but since these are overcollateralized loans with interest, borrowers will ultimately have to repay more alUSD than they borrowed. Thus, any short term pressure put on the market or transmuter, will be negated by borrowers repaying their loan. In fact, since they have to pay back more than they borrowed, it will ultimately have a positive effect on the peg"
['[AIP-26] Alchemix Fuse Pool'],"Not sure why do we need this. There is already a great way to borrow alUSD, which is by depositing DAI, and it's interest free, and it's self paying! Isn't that the reason why Alchemix is so attractive? I feel like the current proposals around treasury is getting more and more complicated. "
['[AIP-26] Alchemix Fuse Pool'],"I echo the concerns from @0xFelix and @LogrisTheBard.
Having the treasury mint alUSD out of thin air is a bad move.
The idea that the treasury could bypass the Alchemist, mint alUSD, put it into a lending pool, and still consider it ""not in circulation"" is flat-out wrong.  As soon as the alUSD hits the market (ie. enters the fuse pool and affects interest rates) it is in the market.  It need not be borrowed to be considered ""in the market"".  Since the alUSD was not collateralized in the Alchemist, it is unbacked from the perspective of the Transmuter, the main pegging module.
When the price of alUSD drops, the Transmuter is looked to as a way to restore that peg.  Users purchase and borrow alUSD to exchange it to DAI 1:1.  By diluting the lending interest rate, we are reducing this upward pressure on the price of alUSD, thus destabilizing the peg.  Having interest paid to the treasury does nothing to help the peg, since the treasury does not sit within the Alchemist-Transmuter loop.
I'm all for creating a lending market and bootstrapping it with alUSD generated via a legitimate loan from the Alchemist, but the treasury should not be in the business of printing alUSD."

Hard disagree with this. Since all borrowed alUSD has to be paid back with interest it will actually relieve pressure off the market and the transmuter in the long run.
WRT to the point of it being in the lending market and thus ""in circulation"", who exactly are we diluting in lending markets when there is effectively no lending market for alUSD at the moment? If more people pile into it, then we can withdraw our alUSD and burn it.
Again, I think scale is the key here. If this is modest in size, max 5m, that is 1/60 of the supply of alUSD, and with the depth of our curve market, it won't affect the peg, full stop. "
['[AIP-26] Alchemix Fuse Pool'],"If this AIP goes ahead. What would be the parameters of the fuse pool?
IIRC its up to us to decide the LTV of any given collateral token right? We're 200% and 400% collateralized on pegged pairs within alchemix.  I doubt we could entice many people to our fuse pool when they can get far more use out of their ETH unpegged pairs on other protocols/fuse pools. That's not necessarily a showstopper though, I wouldn't have any issues if there was a 120% collateral ratio for ETH-->alUSD on fuse... Rari are pretty degen friendly, most Rari users are well aware of the liquidation risks involved.
I'm all for treasury diversity + partnerships as I've said a bunch in the past. From the general conversation here it does seem like starting with a small amount and seeing how things go would have negligible impact on the peg.
If we move forward considering this an experiment (as others have suggested) I'm easily for the proposal. "
['[AIP-26] Alchemix Fuse Pool'],"A lot of good debate here and concerns. This just makes a lot of sense to me to diversify the backing of alUSD. I am personally uncomfortable with DAI these days. Living in the US and the current regulatory climate surrounding ""stable value coins"" and DAIs use of USDC is concerning to me. I think it's imperative to diversify treasuries that rely on DAI (unfortunately) and a fuse pool is one way you could do so.
We have no idea if there will be a market for alUSD, so best thing to do is (as suggested) start really small, decide the collateral assets, the collateral rates, utilization, etc. and give this a test. If there is strong demand, this could be a great way (without too much burden) to diversify the treasury and backing of alUSD and as Scoopy points out, the net effect (given borrowers will have to pay back more alUSD than their loan) is positive.
I would vote in favor so long as this is a small step, test the market, gather some info and then push further if successful.
"
['[AIP-26] Alchemix Fuse Pool'],"The treasury printing alUSD is a bad idea.
It does not ""relieve pressure off the market"", since it dilutes the market, and thus adds pressure to the peg.  The argument for creating a lending market when there is none falls flat, because if the market wanted this, it would add more alUSD to the current fuze pools.
The only perceived benefit here is filling the treasury with funds from interest made on lending.  Again, THIS DOES NOTHING TO STABILIZE THE PEG.   It only dilutes the lending market, which in turn destabilizes the peg.  The treasury should not be printing money to make itself more money.  This circumvents the protocol as it was designed, and breaks system invariants.
If you want to take a page out of the fed's book and turn on the money printer, then go ahead and vote yes, but the perceived benefits are not worth the risks."
['[Draft AIP] Update the weekly emissions allocation'],"NOTE: this is not an AIP in itself but a request for comments & suggestions on the below.
The last major update of the allocation of our weekly emissions schedule was done in May (AIP-9). Since then there have been a few updates in separate proposals, like a bribing allocation (AIP-18), the introduction of bonds (AIP-21), and tALCX staking (AIP-22). This AIP is to formalize the emissions allocation going forward in light of these new developments.
Taking into account that:
Bonds for ALCX/ETH have been very successful (>700k in protocol-owned liquidity at the time of writing)
New bonds of the alUSD and alETH pools are planned to be introduced
Alchemix will get a Tokemak reactor for the ALCX/ETH pool (November hopefully?)
Our bribing done through Votium/veCRV bribes have resulted in a high(er) APR% & TVL for both the alUSD and alETH Curve pools
In short, all these actions have resulted in an increased TVL in the pools & more sustainable solutions for keeping liquidity (i.e. we don't need to incentivize the pools as much, because we own/direct more liquidity going forward). As a result, it's time to rethink how we allocate our weekly emissions of ALCX.
My suggestion would be to do the following, with brief explanations why:
40% for bonds (ALCX/ETH SLP, ETH/alETH Curve pool, alUSD Curve pool)
Our bonding programme has been very successful in the pilot phase and I would suggest to ramp this up significantly. Currently, we allocate 10% of the weekly emissions to this (all for the ALCX/ETH pool) but with 2 new bonds bound to be introduced, I think we need to increase our focus on this.
10% for bribes (Curve alUSD & alETH pools)
Our bribes for both Curve pools (mostly through Votium) have been effective in attracting new liquidity (for alETH it went from roughly 45m initially to >200m at the time of writing). However, there is an increasing amount of competition for bribes so if we want to have the same results, we need to step up our game. My suggestion would be to lower the ALCX rewards for LPers but to increase the bribes (and, as a result, the LPers will get less ALCX but more CRV and CVX - so a net win for them). Worth noting here as well that we also benefit from our own bribes through 1) having CVX voting power (so we get to claim part of our own bribes), and 2) Having protocol-owned liquidity in the future results in more CRV/CVX rewards from these pools for ourselves. 
20% for the ALCX/ETH SLP
This is the biggest change in allocations, going from roughly 53-58% today to 20% in this proposal. There are a few reasons for this: 1) we will get a Tokemak reactor for this pair, which will give us more sustainable liquidity. 2) We now own part of this pool ourselves through the bonding programme. 3) 5% from the initial allocation is going to tALCX staking (see AIP-22 and below). 
5% for tALCX staking
Introduced in AIP-22. Personally, I think this is a great way of getting more TOKE and thus being able to direct more liquidity to the ETH/ALCX pool in the future. I would propose to leave the 5% as is and update it later on if needed, depending on how successful this will be.
15% for ALCX single-sided staking
Reduction from 18% currently to 15%. Out of all the pools, this one probably has the lowest direct utility at the moment. However, it does lower the sell pressure & reward long-term holding of ALCX. I would propose to round it down to 15%.
3% for alETH LP
From 6% currently - but compensated by the new allocation for bribes. The question here is: where do we allocate it? Currently, it's split between the Saddle & Curve alETH pools.
7% for alUSD LP
Down from 18% today but worth noting here that our current bribes (400 ALCX/week) are taken out of this allocation. So in reality we are roughly halving the allocation to alUSD LPers. Again, they will be compensated with higher bribes, resulting in more CRV & CVX rewards. 
Any comments or suggestions on the above suggested % would be very welcome.
Two other points of discussion: when to implement this (after the Tokemak reactor comes live? Or immediately?) and do we want to do it stepwise or just switch over all at once?"
['API'],"Hi Team
Wondering can other protocols be built on top of Alchemix?"
['2021/10/08 - Alchemix Fireside Chat - Roadmap'],"Poap will be given soon ™ when gorby has a system built
Roadmap shared here; https://alchemixfi.medium.com/alchemix-roadmap-f569ae958623
We went through the road map sections 1 by 1 then answered questions
Deploy V2
V2 update/overview
Heads down crunch time to get it all frozen, documented, tested, adding as many extra features as possible until nov 1st deadline with runtime verification
After submission, devs will make sure the front end is ready then deploy a testnet for the community to test (exact testnet network tbd but will be accessible, users will get fake tokens). Devs want everyone to play around and try to break it.
N4No has been leading UI effort and it’s beautiful and makes scoopy [redacted]
Biggest change to V2 is you can have multiple collateral types for the same alAsset. Ie stETH can be used for alETH, any supported stablecoin will use alUSD, etc. Definitely targeting the 3CRV trio of tokens, looking at other decentralized stablecoins out there. Targeting ones with the [I missed this, I think multi-collateral?] strategy - LUSD, MIM, etc, will take a harder look at frax, ust, fei, but would like to get those involved
For each collateral type there’s an ever-growing list of strategies - in V2 you can pick from yearn, aave, a number of others that will keep growing. We will not be chasing the hottest yield aggregators as they get exploited quite often. 
For each collateral type you can select different strategies so you can build-your-own yield aggregator (choose your own adventure).
The goal is that for all top yield aggregators, if alchemix supports the aggregator, then there would be no reason to use the aggregator and the user would just use alchemix instead.
Delegated Credit
Delegated credit is another big feature - derivad is running point, so he explained
With delegated credit we can build applications which we can give permission to to draw on behalf of our CDP - so for ex a dAPP could withdraw credit on your CDP for the app to function
Collateralized credit auctions will also use delegated credit (see later on in notes for more info about these)
For example, using streampay - if you need to pay netflix 15/month - instead of them billing you on your bank account, it could draw that amount in credit from your CDP.
You could also send people your credit, such as your kids, and you can set a limit of how much credit they have. Give money to charity, just give them credit line that keeps replenishing.
Major benefit over something like sablier is that you only give them your money when they need it, instead of needing to lock up the full amount and then let sablier let it trickle out. Ie, it removes the idle assets. Streampay’s goal is to completely overtake sablier.
For delegated credit, you give erc 20 approval and you can approve an amount to an address which it can draw - you give dapp infinity approval then within the dapp you would probably specify more specific variables. Ie, delegated credit is the tool that dAPPs are built one, which can then specify the constraints.
Another ex: Imagine an options protocol that integrates with delegated credit - instead of having to constantly top off your account to meet your funding rate, it could just periodically draw from your credit.
For fees - since you approve another contract to draw funds, it should do things automatically on its own. There’s also the “permit” functionality which is an off chain signer message, which is another option vs 2 on chain txns.
Delegated credit works both ways - it can delegate credit, or you can use your credit to pay off their loan! 
You can do custom contract routing through as many contracts are needed
Users are worried about fees for doing things like netflix pay, etc. Scoopy understands that often only dolphins / whales can benefit from the capital efficiency alchemix offers - but multichain is on the roadmap to resolve this and make alchemix more functional for shimps as well.
Decentralize
Currently alchemix is a ⅝ multisig and a snapshot governance - been trying to run it like a DAO as much as possible but at the end of the day it’s still pretty centralized and there are trust assumptions. The goal is to end that paradigm.
Snapshot has developed safesnap - let’s us queue up an admin function (like upgrading a smart contract, changing a variable, sending a txn) - right now this would be thru the multisig, but with safesnap we would queue up the txns on the safesnap gov module then everyone can inspect while the vote is active, dev ops team can also inspect, 
Want to make community contributions more official - working with coordinape. Works like this: everyone gets a give(gift?) token. Based on what people do, others can give the give/gift tokens to others based on who they think should get paid. Based on what tokens individual users have received (unsent tokens are burned), they will get a payout for their work. There are some rich data visualization tools inside of coordinape that makes it easier to catch bad actors / cartels / etc so they can be kicked. This is good for small part time member contributions.
We’ll have a separate grant program where someone can propose something they want to build related to alchemix - the dao can vote on if that proposal gets funding, then the person is expected to go ahead and build the thing. Since v2 is built with composability in mind, sky’s the limit!
Not all governance would have to be on-chain with safesnap - so can still have DAO decision proposals, but all shipped code would go thru safesnap.
The dev team is still usually the ones who queue up the transactions. There are dangers with non-core developers shipping code (look at compound)
Coordinape is closed beta but alcx has beta access
Chains at the bottom listed for L2 are not in any specific order
Getting the treasury wallets more decentralized is a big priority/
AlchemixDAO
the DAO itself is being designed by the devs but they plan to take a lot of community feedback on how it gets designed/gamified. 
Insurance Module
in place for if there’s a crazy event or hack or something that causes a loss in the protocol 
When you stake in the DAO there will be a 10-day unstaking period (same as AAVE)
If a crazy event happens, all staked users will have to vote on if they slash or not. Ie a 1 mill hack that might slash 1-2% may be NBD, but a bigger event would require much more debate/discussion.
Obviously we don’t want this to happen, which is why we’re partnered with runtime verification
There will be a governance module that handles voting and execution on chain
DAO gamification
when you deposit ALCX, you earn a resource called materia points
Materia points deposit in the ledger itself - not a token. When the DAO vote comes you can boost your vote by spending materia points. Contentious decisions down to the wire can be boosted with materia points, users in the DAO longer will have more points. 
Can save up materia points to convert them to materia shards (instead of boosting votes). There will be a farming contract, it will be similar to veCRV boost. Shards can be used to boost rewards, and will be erc 20 so can be traded.
You will have a DAO character with your account (likely will not launch immediately with the DAO because of scope creep), NFT that has equipment slots that you can equip with other NFTs. It’ll be a visual representation of DAO status, it’ll be able to increase clout (more materia point generation), and it will boost your reward rate within the DAO. Users contributing and participating will get more materia shards. 
Then the vision would be to evolve this further, but that’s getting into the 2023 vision.
Legends probably won’t have DAO utility but could be a coupon to get some swag like unisocks. Patrons have metadata, could deposit that into a staking contract to get more materia shards. So patron nft will likely have more DAO utility because of the metadata.
How long after V2 can we expect the DAO and staking to be live? Answer: It's gonna require a lot of work - won’t take nearly as long as V2. Targeted Q1 or Q2 2022, but no promised deadlines.
Around the time of V2 - more info will come out. But impossible to plan more than a few months ahead cuz of how quickly defi moves. So will always deal in generalizations for stuff further along.
Scoopy’s rationale for the DAO as is - could just copy veCRV - but it makes you a prisoner for 4 years and scoopy doesn’t like that, but he likes how it rewards your time commitment, so this balances that.
There will be a tokemak NFT for core voters, and that will also have metadata attached that could work similar to the patron nft. The alchemak.
After V2 devs will look for more team growth
POAPing process is being streamlined which will make future poaps faster. TBD if poap for one today, probably will be.
Will strongly consider giving some groups of users initial materia points or shards (in addition to ideas of getting permanent boosts), nothing is official right now just ideas.
The Ideal voting scenario is gasless voting, if there has to be on chain voting we’ll probably want dao module on layer 2 like arbitrum
V2 Modules
Derivad is a mad behind the scenes genius - this is just a taste of them. One is the boost users idea:
Boost Users
There was a discussion related to this in the future revenue share governance proposal thread
Idea is users would lock up collateral to donate their yield to the protocol for ALCX in return
It’s the industry standard of liquidity mining, like compound and aave. 
You give ALCX tokens as incentivize to attract TVL and protocol revenue. 
So in this case people would deposit stablecoins, ETH, etc - they would give up their yield and alUSD credit, but would get ALCX tokens for their yield instead. You get ALCX, protocol gets your yield. 
This is good because it mimics the transmuter, where it will improve user repayment rates (faster and better yield rates across the board for everyone), which improves the protocol usability enormously and gives us a competitive edge against other protocols with lower yield payouts.
It also increases peg stability because we aren’t introducing new alAssets into the system and the backstop gets filled
Also makes numbers go up like TVL, which increases protocol revenue, which would hopefully reflect upon token price and increase revenue when staking ALCX.
Could also reward users with materia shards / points instead of ALCX to reduce downward pressure on ALCX.
Other alAssets
Other alAssets considered are still a secret
Auctions
-could create a grouping (lot) of NFTs and erc-720s - send these NFTs, etc to a contract. So say you have a crypto punk - what’s it worth? It’s worth what you can sell it for, or worth however much credit you can draw against it. So someone could put up their crypto punk as collateral, and then a user could offer them loan terms - if owner defaults on loan terms, then the punk is given to the lender. This Unlocks NFT loans. It’s like walking into a pawn shop - I’ve got all these NFTs, don’t want to sell, but I want temporary money - they can give you temporary money on terms, if you don’t meet the terms, then they keep your collateral.
Difference between application and auction - the application is where the owner specifies the terms of the loan they want. The auction model is the credit providers proposing the terms. So there is price discovery in both.
All this credit delegation functionality means maxing out the loan is no longer the only use case, so don’t need to split the CDP up, instead, cap the capital used in use cases
Could also pay with your wallet instead of credit delegation, but delegation makes more sense cuz you can send an offer in, but the gas cost would be to the person accepting the offer, which makes it nice.
Alchemix Devs have these dAPP ideas - DAO can create grants to make it happen or onboard more devs. Just a matter of priority list, so it’s nice to put the ideas out there for the community to build where possible to have them built sooner than later. As part of the grants program, there could be a hackathon competition for community to vote on best ones to win grants.
Streampay
Stuff like this exists, but you have to lock up your collateral that then trickles out as payment. With credit delegation the collateral is still earning yield up to the point where it’s sent.
Other Stuff
Testnet will be V2 - butler asked for it sooner than later. Have to make fake contracts for yearn, etc. Have to basically build a simulation, but still useful for team so it’s something they want to have but don’t want to promise it. There will definitely be one for testing UI, etc for the community to play with prior to V2, or put keeper buttons on testnet for people to build on. There will be in depth developer docs for V2 and an SDK so users can easily grasp how to build on alchemix. Whitelist for V2 is still up to runtime verification, right now there’s a kimbo mode where we launch with a whitelist and then have a kill switch to turn it off and make it permissionless.
Ideally DAO will be on l2 like arbitrum to make it affordable to use. Better to wait to choose to have a better idea of “winners” and “losers”. Need to reflect DAO decisions on all chains, etc. With any luck there will be multiple right answers which makes the choice somewhat arbitrary. Still heads down on V2 though so plenty of unanswered questions for future fireside chats. Solidity native L2s are probably best. Ie if ZkSync launches early enough, then that may be the best of both worlds (optimistic rollups have the 1 week bridge back to mainchain unless a 3rd party bridge is used, which makes message passing delayed. Zk rollups could solve that).
Recipe Book
Will have strategies to generate yield - definitely some users will go all in one strategy, but scoopy imagines a lot of choices as more and more things become available. If you’re in the UI you could be overwhelmed by the choices, so the recipe book would be curated combinations of strategies (tbd if these are published by alchemix or by users). Recipe book is beginner vs advanced mode. Recipes are preset - ie don’t change.- though other other yield providers could just manage it all for you.
Likely can’t use non-uponly strategies because then liquidation would need to be enabled. Maybe 90% uponly strategies could be enabled.
Changing yield strategies will be very limited friction
Butler asked about a checklist of what we would need to be fully autonomous to mitigate regulatory risk when protocol rewards are turned on
Regulatory Stuff
There are some people in the core team who are concerned with some of the regulatory FUD
The DAO has insurance as a last resort model and users have something at stake, which gives us more plausible deniability of being a security
And the DAO is managing it and no one on the core dev team has superpowers to do anything
So that could theoretically mean we don’t meet all the standards of being considered a security
Reve sharing TBD if that happens when DAO is active, honestly do not know right now.
Will not have a dedicate channel for regulatory discussion as it starts becoming legal advice. That’s why devs will often abstain from commenting on tax advice, etc too.
Multichain
Once V2 is complete and launched, the goal is giga expansion mode into all EVM compatible chains that have all the required legos (ie, other chains need to have yield aggregators) - polygon makes a lot of sense, ftm because of yearn, abritrum needs some time but def want to do it, solana has compatibility to port over code, etc. BSC exists. Not betraying ethereum but if we don’t go multichain there will be forks so we might as well take all market share we can.
To go multichain we basically mint synthetic assets and send/bridge them to bootstrap the various chains. Just need a yield aggregator to plug in.
There’s a good chance we could get rewards from the newer L2s for coming over there.
New synthetics - intend to do alBTC - but want to expand the product lineup as well (ALTchemix 😉 ) - various tokens will have alAssets
First one after alBTC already decided
After that not entirely sure - would be cool to have competitions like the tokemak core event.
For example - tokens with things like built in yield, like Sushi/xSushi, could be under consideration.
Mim would be rolled into alUSD.
Time for a couple more question before devs have to meet with the tokemak team
Gorby is impressed by the community response on the tokemak thing
Scoopy very happy we got the tokemak reactor and olympus pro, things are turning a corner

['Add Zaps to Alchemix Deposit/Withdrawal'],"TLDR
Problem:
 Alchemix only accepts native ETH and DAI
Solution:
Add Zaps
Details:
Alchemix is currently limited in the deposits that can receive to DAI or Native ETH.

While these are great options, they are limiting. So limiting in fact, it can't even accept wETH.
I hear you saying: ""Reeserj, how lazy are you that you won't hop over to Sushi, do the swap and then come to Alchemix and deposit for some of that precious alETH?""
Me:  ""Yes. I'm lazy, but you know what? So are most users.""
You: ""That's true, so what do we do about it?""
Me:
""I'd like to propose adding a Zaps feature, like our friends at Zapper have. This would enable people to swap from common liquid pairs into ETH or DAI, and then deposit all in one transaction."" 

You: ""Would we have to build this from scratch?""
Me: ""This is DeFi, everything is composable, Yearn has implemented the Zaps feature for their vault deposits and they're our dear friends, I think someone would be able to point us in the right direction for implementing this into Alchemix.
"
['Add Zaps to Alchemix Deposit/Withdrawal'],"It seems like this might be something for when v2 launches and there's multiple options for yield. Not sure if smart contract interaction with the vault/zapper would be prioritized for v1 when the team is grinding out  the future.
I could see a user wanting to quickly switch between ETH pegged assets when depositing in the vault depending on which has the best yield at the time.  It's a feature I've used at yearn a few times + saves non-whales gas on L1.
I think it's a good idea just a bit early."

"['[AIP - 25] Launch alBTC before Alchemix V2, and alBTC launch parameters']","Part 1 – Launch alBTC Before Alchemix V2
alBTC is currently the missing piece of the “Big 3” triangle of Alchemix Vaults (alETH, alUSD, alBTC). alETH has proven the ability of the Alchemix team to launch additional alAssets based on yearn vaults. Additionally, WBTC yields on yearn are often higher than those of WETH, meaning alBTC is set up for success. Given V2 is set to be shipped to auditors Nov 1st, and will be released late December at the earliest, there is a window of time where we could soft-launch alBTC to start building liquidity and backing prior to V2 without cutting into V2 development resources. This would likely create some additional work to migrate alBTC from V1 to V2, plus users would need to migrate their collateral, which are both reasons to keep the launch somewhat conservative (similar to alETH).
Per Scoopy, “internally, the team doesn’t have consensus on alBTC using the V1 architecture”. At least one member of the dev team has expressed their desire to make this happen.  The engineer portion of the dev team seems relatively against it but open to a vote, per alETHnocratic: “optimistically, it would take 2 dev weeks to launch alBTC (1 dev week === 1 week of work for 1 dev). given that V2 should launch 8 weeks after the audit starts, it would mean launching alBTC on legacy code, only to have it run for 6-7 weeks before a much better, audited, legoable version is available.  this is, imo, not worth it, and dev time would be better spent readying things like scalable deployments for even more alchemix systems, modules built on V2, keepers for v2, and the AlchemixDAO. having said that, I am very interested in decentralizing Alchemix as much as possible, so depending on the level of support for this AIP I think we would consider shifting resource priorities.”. Per 0xDerivadALCX: “going with legacy code now doesn't make sense cause people will have to migrate from al v1 products to v2”.
The primary reason to launch alBTC early is to make the V2 alBTC user experience better: V2 is expected to bring a massive TVL as well as overall attention increase to Alchemix. We know that alAsset pools need to slowly ramp up to maintain peg, and if we have to release alBTC and slowly ramp it up when V2 is released, then many users are going to run into the debt cap as their first experience with alBTC. Releasing alBTC early allows us to start the process of establishing the debt cap early and have an initial idea of what the market interest is in alBTC, which will let us raise or maintain the debt cap in advance of the V2 launch.
A vote “for” launching alBTC before V2 does not necessarily mean it would for sure happen, but instead signifies the community’s desire for an early alBTC launch, which will heavily influence the development priority list. For that reason, I believe it’s important to include the note that if alBTC cannot launch more than 4 weeks prior to V2, we instead wait for V2. The primary decision here is if losing some non-V2 development time is worth getting a jump start on alBTC liquidity and debt cap.
Part 2 – alBTC Launch Parameters 
I propose the following initial parameters for the launch of alBTC:
Collateralization ratio: 400%
Debt Cap: 100 alBTC
The intent is to get a jump start on establishing a peg and liquidity for alBTC. The high collateralization ratio is to ensure ample alBTC flows to the transmuter, which helps strengthen the peg and increase yields in the system. The 100 alBTC debt ceiling approximately matches the initial 2000 alETH debt ceiling, which ensures the supply doesn’t balloon faster than we can establish an alBTC market. It is also easier to raise the debt cap and lower the collateralization ratio in the future, rather than go the other way. The wbtc vault on yearn has 94m USD in it, and Scoopy believes it would be relatively unaffected with an additional 30-50m, which is about 1000 BTC. A conservative assumption of 10 BTC deposited for each 1 alBTC of outstanding debt (alETH is more like 7:1 right now, note this is possible due to the 1:1 ETH:alETH swap feature) also gets us to the 100 alBTC initial debt cap.
I propose the Alchemix protocol enables a 1:1 one-way WBTC to alBTC swap for users who wish to swap directly into LPing for alBTC, similar to what is available for alETH.
I propose the vault display a warning letting users know they will need to pay gas to migrate their funds in X weeks (X likely = 5-6). (This warning is another reason we may see more like a 10:1 BTC:alBTC debt ratio, as users who 1:1 swap to LP alBTC will not need to modify anything).
I propose that the emissions schedule be modified thus (italics represents a change):
ETH/ALCX: 53% + 5% for tALCX -> 50% + 5% for tALCX
ALCX Only: 18% -> 18%
3CRV/alUSD: 18% -> 18%
alETH/ETH (Saddle): 3% -> 3%
alETH/ETH (Curve): 3% -> 3%
alBTC/BTC (TBD): 0% -> 3%
alBTC will likely be less in-demand than alETH. This is because alBTC requires obtaining WBTC, which is another layer of risk and complexity. Additionally, defi natives tend to denominate more often in ETH, or at least hold less BTC compared to other users. However, BTC is still the largest and most owned coin in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, so there will still be some level of demand. Either way, the goal is to for the alBTC LP to be one of the best yield opportunities on BTC in all of defi, similar to alETH. Therefore, the alBTC/BTC pool is given 3% of the awards – less than alETH, but still a reasonable size to attract liquidity.
The rewards are taken from the ETH/ALCX SLP as that pool is the least critical to vault functionality, currently has deep liquidity with minimal slippage, and it’s possible that more efficient liquidity from the tokemak reactor could replace any liquidity we lose from the reduction. alUSD is already split between bribes and curve rewards, and the alETH debt ceiling is still in its infancy, so it needs all the liquidity it can get to continue growing.

"['[AIP - 25] Launch alBTC before Alchemix V2, and alBTC launch parameters']","I'm glad there was a conversation about this. Thanks ov3rkoalafied for putting this together.
There clearly is some near term value to an early alBTC release. However the tradeoffs don't seem worth it:
1) v2 + DAO is what we expect to be the basis of the long term value, so any inhibition to progress on that is very expensive when you compound it over a year +
2) the community cost of a rushed product going awry is extremely high (our existing claim to a novel rug derivative is plenty in my book...)
3) the cost (and psychological toll) of developers working on something they are not comfortable with is also very high
If this were simply an early release of a v2 feature, that would be more appetizing. But if this takes meaningful dev resources, increases pressure on devs, and will be scrapped in v2, the answer is a pretty clear ""no"" to me."
"['[AIP - 25] Launch alBTC before Alchemix V2, and alBTC launch parameters']","Audits can take a while (and then some fixes will prob need to be made post-audit) and its quite possible the timeline of the V2 ends up being longer than anyone wants as a result through normal testing and audit related delays.

Sounds like we have more to lose, and not much to gain my introducing alBTC with only a few weeks/months lead on v2. I don't like the extra complexity and risk it introduced no a v1 -> v2 migration. We've waited this long (only long in crypto time) for alBTC. My vote is to stick with the patient approach at this point.
If we had this discussion a few months ago, it might have made sense to bring in the big three ahead of v2. Or if we were looking at another 6 months plus until v2, it would be worth considering this step of stepping stone upgrade.
As an aside, I'm also under the impression that alETH is performing very differently than alUSD -- it's easier for people to make a 2:1 calculation on stablecoin value. A 4:1 on a volatile asset is a bit harder to know how to leverage. I'm guessing more integrations with things like spell, curve, ohm, toke, etc is what's really going to help drive alassets."

"['[AIP - 25] Launch alBTC before Alchemix V2, and alBTC launch parameters']","alBTC would be useful when demand for BTC goes up, probably almost exclusively for hodler's of BTC products. As we have the merge, potential flippening and such at our doorstep, demand for BTC pegged assets is not really up there yet (like during a halving event). Maybe look to add this next summer/fall if BTC is popular again and has demand? (Honestly with current DeFi scene, I don't see a use case for alBTC at all)
Anyways, we have a much cooler product to focus on. The age of L2's and Sidechain interaction is beginning, but right on its heels is the age of stable coins. We should shore up what alchemix's core product is, something which is about to be in very high demand. Self-paying currency creation events.
I have no idea what roadmap is, but IMO alUSD accepting variable collateral for alUSD needs to be our next strategic focus. With follow ups being expanding to roll-ups/sidechains (if we even want that), or some other way to bring value and stability to the stablecoin ecosystem."

This would likely create some additional work to migrate alBTC from V1 to V2, plus some users may need to migrate their collateral, which are both reasons to keep the launch somewhat conservative (similar to alETH).
Part 2 – alBTC Launch Parameters 
I propose the following initial parameters for the launch of alBTC:
Collateralization ratio: 400%
Debt Cap: 140 alBTC
The intent is to establish a soft peg for alBTC. The high collateralization ratio is to ensure ample alBTC flows to the transmuter, which helps strengthen the peg and increase yields in the system. The 140 alBTC debt ceiling approximately matches the initial 2000 alETH debt ceiling, which ensures the supply doesn’t balloon faster than we can establish an alBTC market. It is also easier to raise the debt cap and lower the collateralization ratio in the future, rather than go the other way.
I propose the Alchemix protocol enables a 1:1 one-way WBTC to alBTC swap for users who wish to swap directly into LPing for alBTC, similar to what is available for alETH.
I propose that the emissions schedule be modified thus (italics represents a change):
ETH/ALCX: 53% + 5% for tALCX -> 48% + 5% for tALCX
ALCX Only: 18% -> 18%
3CRV/alUSD: 18% -> 17%
alETH/ETH (Saddle): 3% -> 3%
alETH/ETH (Curve): 3% -> 3%
alBTC/BTC (TBD): 0% -> 6%
For various reasons, alBTC could be expected to be more or less attractive to liquidity providers than alETH. Defi natives tend to hold more ETH than other cryptocurrency investors, so attracting BTC capital may be more difficult. However, BTC is still the largest and most commonly owned coin in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Either way, the goal is to for the alBTC LP to be one of the best yield opportunities on BTC in all of defi, similar to alETH. Diverting an equal amount of ALCX rewards to alBTC as we do to alETH should make this plenty feasible.
The largest reward chunk is taken from the ETH/ALCX SLP as that pool is the least critical to vault functionality, currently has deep liquidity with minimal slippage, and it’s possible that more efficient liquidity from the tokemak reactor could replace any liquidity we lose from the reduction. alUSD is also sufficiently deep and has been around longer than alETH, so the remaining 1% is taken from there. ALCX single stake already has trouble keeping up with emissions in other pools being dumped, and single stake ALCX is the least likely to be dumped - so it’s better to try to make other emissions more efficient where possible first.
Options:
Option 1: Agree that alBTC should launch before V2 and after Nov 1st, and agree with the proposed launch parameters.
Option 2: Agree that alBTC should launch before V2 and after Nov 1st, but disagree with launch parameters and would like to propose an alternative.
Option 3: Disagree that alBTC should launch before V2 and would instead like to wait for V2 (and figure out launch parameters then).

(1) Reverse rug incident had a huge impact on the project (has not even recovered to pre-rug price levels), would prefer devs focus entirely on shipping v2 out before even thinking about alBTC. Project will unlikely be able to withstand another such incident.

['[AIP-21] ALCX Bond Program'],"The Problem:
Alchemix emits approx 16k ALCX weekly towards liquidity providers across our pools. At current prices, this amounts to roughly $5.5m per week, or $20m per month. This is an astronomical figure for temporary liquidity, and presents itself as a possible bottleneck to growing Alchemix. Solving this is critical for protocol sustainability.
The Solution:
In order to address this problem, we are proposing an Alchemix bond program in partnership with Olympus. We will offer 1600 ALCX weekly available for purchase via bonds, which is roughly 10% of the current weekly farming rewards. We will initially target our three flagship liquidity pools: ALCX/ETH SLP, alUSD3CRV LP, and alETH Saddle LP.
With the accumulated LP tokens from the sales of ALCX bonds, we will also participate in farming with the protocol owned LP tokens. In addition to earning ALCX in each of these pools,  we have the opportunity to earn extra governance tokens from other projects. ALCX/ETH SLP also earns SUSHI and  alUSD3CRV LP also earns CRV and CVX via convex. If we start incentivising bonds for the d4 Saddle LP (alUSD, FEI, FRAX, LUSD) and the mStable alUSD feeder pool, we will also earn TRIBE, FXS, LQTY, and MTA.
We anticipate that some might say that the DAO is stealing from the farmers if it enters the farming pools. The counter to that is that many in the community have expressed that emissions are too high, and if the schedule is unchanged, it would be detrimental to the project in the long term. However, we are wary of changing the emissions schedule because when other projects tried this, it didn’t work very well, hurting the token more than helping it. This program will result in the DAO progressively diluting farmers, which would accelerate the disinflationary schedule of ALCX. This would make ALCX scarcer on the market, reduce the need for large farming budgets, and make Alchemix and its various markets much more sustainable.
The farmed ALCX would just return to the DAO balance sheet and can be used to fund other things or even be returned to the bond program. The other tokens, likewise, would be added to the DAO balance sheet. For CRV and CVX, we would accrue these tokens and use them to boost our pool in Curve and the 3CRV rewards would be added back into the alUSD3CRV pool to boost liquidity even further. For the other governance tokens, they can become a proxy for Alchemix meta-governance, collateral assets, grant money, emergency rainy-day fund, token value accrual, or deployed in DeFi to earn extra yield.
Implementation:
In essence, Olympus is offering it’s bonding program to Alchemix. This would include having the UI built for this program, helping us set everything up, and continuing to maintain the parameters for the program. In exchange for their support and expertise, Olympus would take a 3.3% fee on all ALCX bonds sold. Olympus will use the ALCX they earned from their fees as extra backing for OHM, which would help to reduce the circulating supply even further. 

This chart tracks the average discount of OHM bonds relative to the market. They vary greatly but average around 6-7%. If we target 1,600 ALCX bonds weekly, 52.8 ALCX will be paid to Olympus DAO, and with a 6-7% average discount, Alchemix DAO would convert approximately 90% of the purchased ALCX bonds into LP positions, which would be added as permanent liquidity.
The Olympus bond contracts have dynamic prices for the bonds to ensure that there is constant buy-pressure. They achieve this through the discount rate. If the mean discount of ALCX bonds is relatively low (under 7%), we would likely look to increase the amount of ALCX available for bonds, and vice versa, if the mean discount is too high (over 10%), we would look to decrease the amount of available bonds. If this program proves to be successful, approximately 10% of a year's worth of emissions at current prices would purchase the protocol $15-20m in liquidity. This amount would be highly reflexive relative to the ALCX price, and could deviate significantly in either direction. In the optimistic scenario, ALCX price appreciates and two years from now, Alchemix will control over 100m of LP tokens, and earn millions annually from them.
These ALCX bonds will have a one week vesting period. This is to ensure that discount buyers can’t immediately flip their positions because they typically will be buying at a discount. The ALCX bonds will continually vest, so you will be able to do partial claims before the vesting period is over if you want to sell, farm, or LP with them.
Conclusion:
The ALCX Olympus bond program will initially take approximately 10% of the farming emissions to purchase the LP tokens essential to our protocol. This will create sustainable, permanent liquidity for the protocol. It will accelerate the disinflationary schedule of ALCX and provide additional revenue to the DAO in a variety of tokens, which can greatly enhance our ecosystem in myriad ways. While this will ultimately lower the farming rewards, we view this as beneficial for the long term sustainability of Alchemix.

['[AIP-21] ALCX Bond Program'],"scoopy This is awesome! Alchemix owning it's liquidity seems like a great way to scale and guarantee a floor level of liquidity. Even better if it reduces sell pressure on ALCX and increases CVX holdings.
One suggestion on implementation:
(1) In addition to accepting LP positions with these bonds, accept DAI and ETH directly. 
(2) Take half of the ETH or DAI obtained and purchase alETH or alUSD directly from the protocol to boost yield
(3) Then finally create the LP positions using the 50/50 alETH/ETH or alUSD/DAI and proceed as specified in this proposal, staking and earning for the treasury.
This would have additional positive effects in that it would boost yield every week and create new liquidity positions, instead of just buying existing ones off the market as this proposal suggests 🙂"
['[AIP-21] ALCX Bond Program'],"Love this proposal and the collaboration with Olympus, who obviously have been very successful with their bonding programme. To me owning part of the liquidity will become more important over time as we add more assets to Alchemix and as the protocol grows in TVL. The current inflationary rewards scheme has been very successful in attracting liquidity but at the cost of having mercenary capital, dumping, and price depression of the ALCX token. So I'm all for this proposal and to start selling LP bonds.
My only question would be: are we being ambitious enough with the ALCX allocation? This bonding programme can clearly be a game changer, and while it's good to start with a relatively low allocation (at 1600 ALCX a week) to test the waters, wouldn't it be better to increase the allocation for bonds / to ramp it up over time? Especially because we are now discussing 3 different LP bonds (ALCX/ETH SLP, alUSD3CRV LP, and alETH Saddle LP), so the total amount of liquidity acquired per week will be relatively low in the beginning."
['[AIP-21] ALCX Bond Program'],"0xFelix we wanted to start conervatively to ensure that the discount wouldn't be too high. If it does prove effective, I'd be more than open to increasing the total amount allocated to the bond program"
['[AIP-21] ALCX Bond Program'],"0xFelix I second this, and I also wouldn't mind increasing the lock up period here. I think Alchemix supporters that intend on sticking around long term and participating in the DAO don't intend on selling anyway and would likely participate regardless, and it would prevent the game of people picking up the bond and dumping a week later for profit if the price hadn't depreciated. If possible maybe it can be a lever for the DAO to experiment with, since the priority should obviously be to sell out the bond each week"
['[AIP-21] ALCX Bond Program'],this is the wei
['[AIP-21] ALCX Bond Program'],"Comparing these two scenarios, only looking at ALCX/ETH for simplicity:
As proposed, 10% of issuance is set aside to offer bonds, where the treasury purchases ALCX/ETH LP tokens with ALCX, paying a premium (which, to the buyer, is a discount).
5% of ALCX issuance is market sold for ETH, and it is deposited into the SLP with 5% of ALCX issuance with the treasury retaining the SLP tokens.
Can we enumerate all the differences between the two? Does the bonding discount help Alchemix at all, or just offer an arb that people can use to drain the treasury? Scenario 1 results in Alchemix owning existing liquidity rather than adding new liquidity to pools, which may or may not be an advantage. Also, the 3.3% Olympus fee may be a net positive in that integrations bring value."

Care to explain more about this part?
What is the pessimistic/conservative scenario?
Which risks were identified?"
['[AIP-21] ALCX Bond Program'],"jamesk 
From my understanding, instead of emitting ALCX to people who simply stake ALCX in the single sided staking pool, we would be providing bonds which offer discounted ALCX over a vesting period. It would be incentivized to purchase these bonds if the discount rate deems it worthy and as users pay in DAI/ETH + LP tokens, this would help the protocol permanently lock in LP tokens that earn fees + DAI/ETH which could be used in a multitude of ways (purchase alAssets.) 
The pessimistic scenario + risk in this case would be if people who purchase bonds simply do so in order to dump the ALCX tokens back into the market. However, if staking ALCX had positive incentives, then this could lead to a scenario where users purchase bonds to attain ALCX at market discount then stake ALCX. This is like a (3,3) scenario in that users benefit + protocol benefits. This is a more sustainable way of emission and could really grant the protocol a strong moat of permanent liquidity. Correct me If I am wrong in my understanding but the real risk IMO is not doing something like this. "
['[AIP-21] ALCX Bond Program'],"I love the overall concept: the protocol paying to acquire permanent liquidity that it owns, rather than temporarily renting the liquidity at a very high rate.
That said, the discount rate being targeted of 10% over 5 days is waaaaay too high. A 10% discount makes sense as a target for Olympus with their OHM bonds, given single-staking OHM has had yields in the 7,000-20,000% APY range. A 1.25% discount for 5 days would already be greater than the 5-day yield on the ETH/ALCX pool (currently showing a 90% APR). When you then factor in that the ALCX purchased with the bond can be claimed as it vests over the 5 days and single-staked for 69% APR, the deal gets even better.
I recommend revising the proposal to target a much lower discount, maybe 1.5% or 2.0% at the very highest. I understand that most users will see that as being too small if it's being presented the way that Olympus does with their bonds, because they aren't doing the math to realize that's really a 109.5-146% APR. Maybe if that's explicitly spelled out in the UI, we can make it work. Heck, maybe even start with the insane 10% (or slightly less insane 5%) discount rate to start and get attention, but then quickly bring the target down to a number more in line with the existing rates the DAO is paying for liquidity.
"
['[AIP-21] ALCX Bond Program'],"delitzer
The discounts aren't set in stone with olympus bonds. There is a dynamic price where there is a function of time between bond sales that determines the price. The longer the time between purchases, the lower the bond price becomes. The discount rate is purely determined by supply and demand. We can change the vesting period or try to fine tune the ALCX available to hit a certain discount %, but such fine tuning will require the program to be up and for us to have some data to go on."
['[AIP-21] ALCX Bond Program'],"Thank you for bringing up this proposal. I think it is a wonderful symbiosis between Alchemix and Olympus to foster a partnership of this kind.
A brief word about bonds and discounts. The bonding mechanism operates as a secondary market in which the discount is a function of bond capacity and bond demand, where bonders try to beat other investment strategies like staking. So in your case, the amount of ALCX used to sell bonds and the amount of liquidity you target decides how much bond capacity there is within a certain timeframe. Given a certain bond capacity, the bonders on the secondary market decide at which discount they purchase your bonds. The discount is not configured by anyone. Olympus does not dictate to you at what discount you should sell. The discount is merely a function of supply and demand, which is also why bonds work without any price oracle. If the discounts trend higher, there is less demand for the available supply aka bond capacity. If the discounts trend lower, there is more demand for the available supply. Bonders will purchase bonds at the discount they think is competitive for a given ""payment"" asset, which is ALCX in your case. For e.g. OHM the 5 day staking ROI is about 6% right now, which is why the bonds sell around this range at this point. For e.g. ALCX the discount will try to beat whatever staking or other investment strategy there is, considering supply and demand on the secondary market of your bond programs.
We will be super happy to help everyone figure out how bonds work and we will also be glad to help you configure capacities of your bond programs, because these things tend to be a bit tricky given dynamic market conditions. For these reasons I think it is super smart to work together with people who built the bonding mechanism and operated bond programs successfully in the past. "
['[AIP-21] ALCX Bond Program'],100% in support of this proposal.
['[AIP-21] ALCX Bond Program'],"Question... 
Is this proposal in addition to (the good chance) ALCX being added to Tokemak? 
Or as contingency, should ALCX not receive the required votes?
To say it's neither would imo, feel a little short sighted considering the implications of having a reactor would mean for the team and community. If nothing else, it would surely simplify the above proposal...
Regardless of the Tokemak reactor vote at the end of this month, ALCX will get a reactor eventually, of that I'm very confident. The reactor model, imo resolves everything this proposal is concerned with and to a degree that is far simpler to understand:
'A single ALCX pool with IL protection, that facilitates all ALCX based pools.'
Jmo, but I think this should be considered a variable within the above proposal. "
['[AIP-21] ALCX Bond Program'],"Gravity I would say that we can definitely use a TOKE reactor + a bonding programme at the same time since they are very complimentary. Especially at the start the TOKE reactor will only be good for assets traded against ETH/USDC - so this would most certainly support the ALCX/ETH trading pair. But the beauty of this bonding proposal is not so much for trading ETH/ALCX but for the alToken/Token pools. Owning liquidity in those pools is in my opinion way more important since these pools will make or break Alchemix as a product. On top of that, I think that for alToken/Token pools we should own the liquidity and we shouldn't have to rely on a LD in Tokemak to solve this for us. (And I'm saying this as a big fan of Tokemak.)"
['[AIP-21] ALCX Bond Program'],This is wonderful!
['[AIP-21] ALCX Bond Program'],"Absolutely love this proposal. A real Win-win-win
A win for newcomers -> they can buy ALCX at a lower price
A win for ALCX holders -> less incentives required for liquidity providers, so more value for your token
Another big win for ALCX holders -> additional stream of revenue: both liquidity farming and trading fees (eternally!)
A win for ohm and interprotocol cooperation
There is only one thing I am a bit concerned about. This bond program gives traders arbitrage opportunities. They can buy ALCX at a discount and sell it for profit leading to a downward pressure on the price. You can argument that the same counts for Ohm, but I believe that's not 100% true. The Ohm community has a very strong staking mentality (3,3), also boosted by the enormous APY's. Furthermore, although the ohm protocol sells bonds with a discount, it is till making a lot of money on every sale as it is selling something that is backed by a value of ""a few dai at max"" (1 Ohm) for multiple hundreds of Dai. (currently)
Since these mechanisms are not at play at ALCX, the bond program might put some downward pressure on the price of ALCX - also leading to impermanent loss in the LP positions.
Maybe good staking incentives might mitigate this downward pressure in the future? (e.g. fee sharing, boosted APY on loan payback, dao/NFT functionalities,...)
Interested in hearing your thoughts about this."

['[AIP-24] Incentivisation of the Curve alETH pool'],"Currently, the Saddle alETH pool (WETH/alETH/sETH) is the main pool to swap alETH & ETH and it receives ALCX rewards from the weekly emission schedule to incentivize liquidity. Recently, a Curve factory pool (ETH/alETH) was created that essentially serves the same function. A factory pool is a permissionless pool that anyone can spin up and as soon as it reaches sufficient volume it will be moved to the main Curve UI. For those who are not aware, Curve is the largest decentralized exchange for (soft-)pegged assets that almost always offers the best exchange rates & slippage.
AIP-24 would propose to split the alETH ALCX weekly emissions between the Saddle and Curve pools at a ratio of 50%/50%.
Reasons to incentivise the new Curve alETH pool
To boost liquidity in this new pool (current liquidity there is essentially zero).
Curve is far more integrated into the DeFi ecosystem than Saddle (just one example of this: as far as I know currently no DEX aggregators list alETH while alUSD - from the alUSD Curve pool - is included.)
We can apply for a gauge once we have enough volume, which would give the LPers of the pool CRV rewards (and, if staked on Convex afterwards, also CVX rewards.)
Once the pool has a gauge we can also start ""bribing"" as we do for the alUSD pool.
We will also be able to use our treasury CVX to boost the gauge.
In short, this would help to increase liquidity and give users more options to exchange alETH/ETH.
Reasons to keep incentivising the Saddle alETH pool
It is currently the only pool with alETH so we don't want to shock the system by removing the rewards.
Saddle helped Alchemix in a pinch when launching the initial pool so it's only fair to continue to support them.
Downsides
This will fragment liquidity which could affect slippage on large swaps and potentially the alETH/ETH peg (although it would also give arbitrageurs more options).
Vote
A vote for this proposal signals you are in favour of splitting the alETH ALCX rewards 50/50 between the Saddle and Curve alETH pools. A vote against this proposal leaves the current incentivisation as is (100% to the alETH Saddle pool).
"
['[AIP-24] Incentivisation of the Curve alETH pool'],"Hey! Long time lurker here. Full disclosure, I'm heavily involved in Saddle, and I'm an alETH pool LP. That said...
It feels like splitting liquidity is the worst of both worlds here. You're suggesting fragmenting liquidity for little clear gain and no guarantee of incentives from the Curve community (though the chance to bribe is nice ofc).
1inch and Matcha both aggregate other Saddle pools. Contacting them to get the alETH pool integrated seems like step 1?"
['[AIP-24] Incentivisation of the Curve alETH pool'],"mhluongo To me the fragmentation of liquidity is a temporary issue because I believe we will be able to build up a significant amount of liquidity on Curve as soon as we have a gauge + we can still maintain a high level of liquidity on Saddle with this proposal. The gauge vote is permissionless now as well and I don't see a reason why this would be declined, especially because we should be able to bribe CVX holders to vote in favour of it.
One other thing to consider is that there have been a lot of complaints about the high rate of ALCX inflation within the community. With Saddle pools Alchemix has to provide 100% of the incentivization to attract liquidity (since Saddle does not have a token) but within the Curve/Convex system LPers will get CRV & CVX rewards as well. Hence, over the long-term, we will be in a position to lower the ALCX inflation since LPers will be compensated differently.
On a personal note, I would also say that I see a lot of developments in the Curve ecosystem (Convex, veCRV bribing, Votium) while I don't see this at Saddle. This is not to put any blame on the Saddle developers and/or community (again, I think they are necessary competitor to Curve and launching the initial alETH pool was very well-received by the community). But I do think these long-term developments are something to consider for this proposal as well, and I think that the proposed split is fair to both parties."

['[AIP-24] Incentivisation of the Curve alETH pool'],"This is a hard one and I feel like strong arguments can really be made for both sides. Curve has been kind of shitty to Alchemix in recent times (removing alUSD discussions, bailing on the initial alETH pool) which sucks, but with how fast things change in this world it can't really be held against them too much. Saddle was there and helped us through that and things have seemed to be running great with them so far, but yah, they don't seem to be doing all that much to ingrain themselves into aggregators and the larger DeFi ecosystem.
I agree with Butler and mhluongo that fragmenting the liquidity may not be worth it right now as there is relatively little to be gained from this. It might be something where we start the pool and keep an eye on it to see what kind of usage and rewards it sees and then reevaluate at a later date. Right now we should contact aggregators to see if they will integrate with Saddle since in the future they should route through both anyway so we don't end up with people trading through a pool with really shitty slippage"
['[AIP-24] Incentivisation of the Curve alETH pool'],Does this mean eth yield will be roughly cut in half?
['[AIP-24] Incentivisation of the Curve alETH pool'],"taylor_eth 
The liquidity will also be split among 2 pools instead of one. So for example, if both the Saddle pool and Curve pool now get half of the current rewards, but half of Saddle's TVL moves to Curve, the yield will stay equal on both. Over time I think the market will balance out the TVL on both pools such that the yield will be roughly the same."
['[AIP-24] Incentivisation of the Curve alETH pool'],"I think it would be good to get more activity on Curve.  They can do more for Alchemix than Saddle can.  I don't like all the fragmentation of ALCX rewards.  I get the idea of being loyal to Saddle but it's perfectly normal to move rewards from one vault to another, even if to an LP competitor.  We owe it to the stakeholders. "
['[AIP-24] Incentivisation of the Curve alETH pool'],I do think that the Curve pool needs to be incentivized and I believe that the incentives should be monitored and adjusted at a later stage according to the TVL in order to achieve a target ROI in both pools. We coulds start with the 50/50 split proposal and move from there. 
['[AIP-24] Incentivisation of the Curve alETH pool'],"Honestly I was a little torn at first glance, but I talked myself into it with some of the points others have made also.
On one hand fractured liquidity isn't ideal, on the other Curve is so established and integrated into defi that it's kinda  silly to not have an alETH presence there long term.
Looking at just the 24hr volume on saddle, we did $521k. Directly comparing to curve that would be the 26th pool by 24hr volume (3rd for ETH specific pools). I'm sure if we were deployed on curve, they would quickly do more volume than saddle
In addition, by splitting the ACLX rewards in half, we would still be pretty competitive for the top APR/Y on curve  for ETH pools (roughly tied with stETH). That should serve to attract liquidity and incentivize higher volume traded as well.  Plenty of people will ape into whatever the best APY is.
Once Curve/CVX rewards come into play, we'd be by far the most profitable ETH-pegged pool.
On a tangent that might not make much sense (haven't gone deep into Tokemak yet). If our vote goes through on that proposal and we end up working with them for bootstrapping liquidity, is it viable to have it deployed in the curve/saddle pools? Or is that not how it works?
Edit: I believe scoopy has long-standing relationships with the saddle team (sorry if i'm misremembering). If this picks up steam maybe he would be able to keep things tight with them.
Personally, I'm a big advocate for building long-term partnerships in the space as much as possible. The better integrated we are in terms of the protocol and community, the more treacherous a moat future copy cats will have to cross. I'd love to keep things good with Saddle (we did launch a hyped product exclusively with them) but, practically, curve is a much bigger player if there does need to be an either/or in the future."
['[AIP-24] Incentivisation of the Curve alETH pool'],"hekmat
very much in favor of continuing pool incentivisation with saddle. they were good to us when we were in a pinch. the fractured liquidity will ultimately be good for LPs in the long run because there will be more trading fees coming from arbitrage. even if we cut rewards in half and split them with the curve pool, we are still incentivising each pool with ~$150k worth of ALCX a week. "
['[AIP-24] Incentivisation of the Curve alETH pool'],"I do understand the logic of being ""loyal"" to Saddle, and I think we should continue to incentivize that pool. But we also need to think about the longer term future of Alchemix. Is having the relatively unknown Saddle, as our only official place to swap alETH a good look for us? Given how large the ambition of Alchemix is? Surely we aspire to be highly liquid on major DeFi platforms, to continue to grow the brand, and be taken seriously?
Getting a liquid alETH pool on Curve is pretty much a no brainer. The fact that the liquidity for alETH is on a protocol many DeFi users won't have heard of will be a big turn off to attracting new users. It also likely restricting the pool liquidity from growing, as some LPs might not trust/be comfortable with Saddle, due to unfamiliarity. This is of course great for those of us farming right now, as it keeps APRs high. But it is potentially unnecessarily strangling us from growing the overall protocol further.
I agree that fractured liquidity is maybe not ideal at this stage, but it's worth the trade off for establishing a presence on Curve. It's highly likely that over a short time, the Curve pool will grow larger than the Saddle pool. And thus, regardless of how we split the rewards, I imagine pure ALCX APR will eventually settle at a much higher rate on Saddle, than on Curve. Saddle would provide the best straight up ALCX yield, while Curve would provide a mixture of ALCX / CRV / CVX yield.
I understand not wanting to ""betray"" Saddle, who helped us out in a tight spot, but we also have to think about the big picture, and getting alETH onto Curve is pretty much essential to grow the protocol, and expand our brand into the big leagues."
['[AIP-24] Incentivisation of the Curve alETH pool'],"Do we have to split it with Saddle? Why not from alcx/eth? I already pay a lot to harvest my rewards from saddle, now I would have to redeploy plus pay fees from  two places everytime I harvest.

You can simply stay in the Saddle pool and continue your harvesting as you do currently. This proposal is to create a 2nd market/pool for alETH/ETH that will help with liquidity on the long-term. But as an LPer you don't have to be in both pools, you can simply leave your funds in Saddle or choose to move over to Curve. Both will be viable options."

['[AIP-23] Increase Immunify Bug Bounty'],"Before Alchemix deployed its first contracts, we contracted Immunify for a $50k bug bounty program. This bounty program awards $50k for critical bugs that could result in users losing funds, $7500 for high severity bugs, $4k for medium severity bugs, and $1k for low severity bugs. The Immunify team has found a few medium level bugs and one high level bug since we have started this program, and overall, we are very pleased with their community’s reviews of our code.
When we first launched, we never imagined the level of success Alchemix would reach, and now we have over 1bln TVL across our alUSD and alETH products and our respective farms. For such a staggering TVL, we feel it is in the best interest of the protocol and all interested parties that we increase the value of our bug bounty program so that we can attract more white-hat hackers to examine our current and future code for bugs.
The new proposed bug bounty will have the following rewards:
Critical: 500,000 USDC
High: 25,000 USDC
Medium: 5000 USDC
Low: 1000 USDC
By adopting this new big bounty reward schedule, we believe it will help us to secure the protocol and be sufficient enough to deter any would-be hacker from exploiting our protocol in the future.

['[AIP-22] ALCX Tokemak Reactor'],"ALCX Reactor on Tokemak
An ALCX reactor on Tokemak will strengthen liquidity for ALCX trading pairs across
trading venues and open up additional opportunities to leverage Tokemak. To initialize an
ALCX reactor, Tokemak requires an operational reserve of ALCX to be able to efficiently
deploy ALCX liquidity to trading venues and make ALCX LPs on Tokemak benefit from IL
mitigation. This can be structured as follows:
Alchemix to make 3M USD in ALCX available to the Tokemak reactor reserve by
proceeding with a DAO-to-DAO trade for 3M USD in TOKE:
• This collateral would allow Tokemak to source an initial 18M USD worth of liquidity (9M USD of ALCX + equivalent 9M USD of ETH)

• The acquired TOKE would make Alchemix DAO a powerful Liquidity Director. Read more about it here: https://medium.com/tokemak/tokenomics-4b3857badc73

• Generalized liquidity can be directed across the ecosystem, ensuring best prices and minimal slippage for ALCX trading

• Opportunity for both ALCX LPs and Alchemix DAO to earn additional rewards
Initiating a reactor will also result in additional ways for the DAO to leverage Tokemak. We propose that we make a new farming pool for tALCX. This pool would initially have 5% (and potentially more in the future) of weekly farming rewards allocated to it. This allocation would be taken away from the ALCX/ETH SLP pool’s rewards, resulting in the sushi pool receiving 53% of the weekly rewards. If the pool proves to be effective, we can progressively transition away from the Sushi pool and into the tALCX pool, and possibly even merging with the ALCX single side pool or  tALCX DAO integration in the future. In doing so, it would confer the following benefits:
• Users that were previously single-asset staking now become LPs, further increasing ALCX liquidity across DeFi

• Simplified process to provide liquidity (effectively single-asset staking) and low risk should increase the willingness of especially less sophisticated holders to participate in LP

• Alchemix, as the tALCX holder, would be the recipient of a sizable amount of TOKE rewards, which could be either used to further increase LD power, or to supplement pool rewards

• ALCX rewards could be lowered as LPs benefit from IL mitigation and/or rewards are supplemented by additional TOKE rewards
A “for” vote signals that you are in favor of Alchemix pursuing a Tokemak reactor and to authorize a $3m token swap between ALCX and TOKE. An “against” vote signals that you are against both.

[...Start scene, begin Scoopy streaming a choppy intro song that gets us all hyped]
[Biddls sounds like a completely normal 12 year old]
Scoopy: V2 progress update - The code is very close to completion and should be done in matter of weeks. Audit scheduled to begin Nov 1, then 6-8 weeks of auditing time for the final audit, which puts us in the december/january range if the audit goes well. Longer if they find something.
Scoopy: AIP Update 
AIP 20 will be split into two separate votes - both use ALCX as collateral to take out MIM from ABRA. 
A portion used to buy CVX to farm / vote to boost our pools. Half used to trade to alUSD to LP it in 3CRV pools to LP/farm that. At any time we could pay the loan back or manage our collateral, with a very low liquidation price. So should give plenty of time to pay or recollateralize if market turns.
AIP 21 proposes setting up a bond program to address long term liquidity concerns and start to clamp down on ALCX supply. More info / discussion below.
Future Tokemak AIP - We are entering into the Tokemak reactor event, working on a proposal that should be out next week. Deposit ALCX, get a derivative tALCX, then we would make an additional farm for tALCX. Plan to incentivize with something small like 5-10% of the farming rewards. If it’s effective we can discuss as a community how to best proceed.
Gorby: Discord update
StreamPay - Gorby uses a payment app called Sablier, which is nice to pay people, but if you want to make recurring payments , then Sablier has your money locked up for the full period. So we should make our own Sablier type thing using Alchemix vaults - you set up the stream of payments by delegating your credit, but it’s only withdrawing capital when it needs it. Gorby + others are in the process of building that. Called StreamPay (or PepoPay or INCOOMStream, other ideas are welcome). Probably needs to rely on the credit delegation feature of V2. It's very early in development - Gorby is mentioning now in case people have really cool ideas for names/features/etc. Upside of using the credit delegation is that it could be automated / set and forget. AW4 says Superfluid finance exists but only works xDAI, DAI, Matic and does a continuous drip - what we’re doing seems better.
Newsletter - We will be doing a newsletter on a regular basis. Worthy and original memes will go in the newsletter and you’ll probably get a worthwhile tip. Artwork as well for the front cover / throughout. Doesn’t have to be high quality, making Gorby laugh trumps artistic talent (but art is cool too). RANDCorp will be collating all the stuff and put it in the newsletter.
New Role - May create a new @Notification Squad role specifically for cool things that aren’t important enough for announcements or governance, and it would be usable by anyone. By default you would have the role and need to opt out. Deriviad said no one wants to have to opt out, but Gorby thinks no one would opt in, so Gorby will make it opt in and automatically opt out Derivad. Have OG and Voter roles, now the point is to have something where we can ping a lot of people but don't disappoint people expecting Alchemix news.
Other Updates:
Patron NFT - Gorby wanted to give a commitment to getting the patron NFT out the door. Scoopy: It’s not a V2 thing. We have the art, we have the data, but all the dev resources are doing V2. We reached out to another dev who said they could probably do it, so we’re gonna follow up and get it out SOON. Apologies, other dev has just taken precedence. Gorby: Medium to long term they will have economic value, not financial advice (devs did not confirm or deny Gorby's statement).
Bonding Partnership with Olympus (AIP 21)
We brought Wartull from Olympus DAO on stage to discuss.
Wartull: Explained that Ohm brings the contractors, contracts, advice etc (ie, this is why people won't just steal their bonding code). This intial partnership is a good catalyst for future contracts (alOHM mentioned. alUSD bonds mentioned in discord). There is a lot of community overlap,  and Ohm is excited to partner. [Wartull then summarized the bonding AIP, not included, just go read it]
Bonding Time Period Question (also relates to Butler's question about 1 week vesting period): Wartull recieved a question about if 5 day bonding is adequate: Wartull said If it’s longer, you’d need a higher discount. For alchemix, with low APYs, there is a case to make it longer. But also need to look at how options are priced and understand that bonds with higher time frames are higher risk, since it's further in the future. That’s why 1 week was chosen - no instant arb opportunity, but also not so long that you need to incentivize users to take on the additional risk. There could be an option to offer multiple terms - 1, 2 and 3 weeks for ex. and study how those are used.
Will we stake the ALCX we get from bonding? Scoopy Answer: We will farm the LP tokens we receive to get ALCX, CRV, CVX, SUSHI, etc. Then we could farm the ALCX itself which could be distributed to stakeholders. We don’t believe that in 1-2 years we’ll control 99% of liquidity (like ohm does) cuz we have a lot of demands to make functional markets, so goal is more like 20-40% in a couple years then just farm alongside everyone else and distribute to the DAO or enhance platform. Per Wartull yields would end up reducing which cause more people to leave which gives the DAO more yield (4-5 year time horizon).. Exciting cuz as we launch more alAssets (alBTC first) we can do slow organic growth and build debt caps as we build the LP positions.
AMA Questions
Biddls: What portion of accounts actually borrow against their balance? Scoopy: For alUSD out of 2k people, only 7 have accrued credit (Ie have no debt), everyone else has borrowed.
Butler question 2 (Strats around liquidity targets?): Primary goal is sustainable liquidity in major markets, so since alUSD is biggest it would get the largest share of ALCX bonds. The others are important though, so will likely do it somewhat proportionally.
Butler: Accept DAI or ETH directly to create DAI or ETH positions? Wartull/Scoopy: Ohm has thought about it. It’s definitely something to consider, but since pools are already balanced it’s easier to just take LP to start. It’s definitely a future idea that will be considered. Gonna take some experimentation.
Butler: Optimal quantity of ALCX emissions? Should it be increased? Scoopy: If it was too low, existing liquidity wouldn’t leave. If too much, we’d be concerned the alAsset markets would become less liquid (cuz too many people would leave, esp if they didn’t withdraw alAssets from the pool). If bonds are sold out, we will increase # of bonds offered slowly but surely (or decrease emissions).
Q: Will DAO hold sOHM from ALCX? - answer No, unless we do a separate arrangement.
Miscellaneous AMA items / chat topics:
Emissions vs Locking up ALCX Note LPs, etc will basically be held forever - we never sell the LPs, just continually use it to collect protocol fees. Gorby discussed that often emissions changes make problems worse, then the protocols often revert, which makes it even worse. It reduces confidence from investors. Of course if the vote goes up and the emissions curve is changed, we have to honor it. The point is here it’s better to just try to get the emissions for the DAO and lock stuff up rather than try to reduce emissions, as then we aren’t fundamentally changing the rules behind the protocol but instead just using the DAO to take advantage of them and also help users). We are only 6 months old, emissions will continue to reduce significantly.  Scoopy seems to agree that it's better to lock up ALCX rather than reduce emissions (ie locking it up is just having the DAO play the game, changing emissions is changing the game and would be less well recieved).
Layer2's: Gorby mentioned L2’s are a good future way to get more TVL in the system. Scoopy said L2s are exciting and interesting, Scoopy has kept up with the scene but we don’t want to take our technical debt forward, so want to wait for V2 to expand across chain.
wen alOHM? Scoopy: no comment can’t confirm or deny
Would the bonding eliminate the need for tokemak? Scoopy: they are two diff platforms. If we have tokemak reactor and own our liquidity from OHM. If tokemak gives us better bang for our buck, then we probably start bonding tokemak. Idea is that you can deposit with tokemak and have tTokens that you can get airdrops from. Or you can deposit with alchemix which holds the tALCX tokens, which will aim to offer more APY than tokemak giving ALCX rewards, but then the DAO will keep TOKE from tToken emissions to vote with.
rETH/stETH in V2? Scoopy: rETH and stETH are definitely something we have in mind for alchemix strategies. In V2, we can accept multiple collateral types (ETH, WETH, sETH, rETH, stETH, etc can all be staked as collateral to mint alETH then use the native yields to pay them off so that’s one way to expand V2 yields).
Q: alUSD use cases? Limiting factor in debt cap? We want to use alUSD in an options protocol and get partnerships there, and Gorby is doing StreamPayTM. One extension is if you can direct StreamPayTM to a new protocol, and they have a StreamPayTM to you for their worthless governance token and if the first stream is canceled then the other one is auto canceled. Can use that to finance DAOs. Tokemak/Bonding will let us scale and make liquidity more efficient which will let us increase debt cap. Right now we have room in both alETH and alUSD and we have authorization from previous AIPs to increase each one. V2 and Layer 2s, etc, etc will let us incorporate any competitive yield farms on defi which will drive TVL and adoption.
Autopay netflix with ALCX? Scoopy has a contact with a payment processor to consider this next year. Could also use StreamPayTM. Lots of ideas. We need a partnership with someone like TrueFI or something, ie basically need the link to a bank account. (tUSD doesn’t have liquidity though). We need a 3rd party.
Wen Patron: Soon ™ (see above)
(biddls tech jargon question) - didn't seem to be much of an answer.
V2 permissionless? New alAssets Permissionless? Permissionless depends on what auditors say / let them do, but building on top of V2 will exist in some capacity (maybe a hackathon)? New alAssets are pretty involved so likely not permissionless to create those.
DAO/NFTs: The DAO has partially gone back to the drawing board. Stalled a bit when alleycat left, but other changes are likely due to the ongoing evolution of the NFT scene. Time weighted voted / materia system / security system all still exist. Which L2 for the DAO has not been decided (needs low cost, security, ease of onboarding). DAO is an ERC-998, it’s an NFT that has slots for you to deposit other NFTs into it. You’ll have a bust (ie, head/neck/shoulders) and a desk and your alchemix NFTs go on your bust and desk. Items will be mix of ERC-721 and-1155 (some batches, some uniques)
Vote Farming: Probably can’t prevent vote farming for NFTs but you don’t get an NFT every time you vote.
Fees: We probably won’t vary protocol fees based on strategy
Community Needs: For now everyone focused on V2, no major needs from community right now. Always looking for more people to do dashboards/data - dyor front end will be opensourced as the dev is now fulltime elsewhere. If anyone is familiar with front end and handling web3 data please reach out. If into SQL, also worth reaching out to Gorby and discussing flipside crypto. Basically Alchemix needs some data people right now, so reach out!
Randcorp came on to discuss the newsletter - gonna be a fun project and great way to keep everybody up to date between AMAs.
DAO NFTS may not come with the DAO right away.
Layer 2's - Scoopy is more partial to ETH friendly chains. Rollups, Polygon, etc for now but not necessarily limited to those. Protocol would work differently on L2 than on L1 or sidechain cuz of how the contracts are set up cuz of cross chain alAsset minting. So solution is to mint alUSD on ETH then bridge it over and load up the sidechain with preminted alUSD. In L1 there’s a debt ceiling. Right now there’s 250m alUSD supply with 150m debt cap, so debt ceiling is soft cap in L1. In L2 it would be a hard cap. Arbitrum and Polygon are current biases.
How to get involved as new community member? Be like biddls - talk a lot, make suggestions or offer to do things (or just do them), then eventually you will make friends and contribute.
Can we customise the looks and traits of our NFTS? Scoopy wants to say yes - pay a little bit for random, or pay more to character creator it.
NFT Benefits in the DAO Character upgrades / NFTs will have benefits in the DAO
Will we have crafting with the NFTS - scoopy wants to say yes, will it get done? Maybe. Can’t just yolo contracts, smart contracts are dangerous.

"[""[AIP-20] Diversifying treasury's ALCX holdings without selling""]","tl;dr
AIP-20-A: put 15k alcx on abracadabra, mint mim at 18.25% liquidation price of current price, buy cvx, lock cvx and vote for alusd gauge and put cvxcrv rewards from locking back in convex for flywheel effect.
AIP-20-B: put 15k alcx on abracadabra, mint mim at 18.25% liquidation price of current price, swap mim for 3crv, put 3crv on alusd farm, farm crv + cvx + alcx, put crv in flywheel, lock cvx, use alcx for paying off original debt.
Proposal
In this post I propose two ways of diversifying the ALCX currently in the Alchemix treasury without directly selling that ALCX in the open market. These two votes can be voted on separately under the monikers of AIP-20-A and AIP-20-B. Both proposals are not mutually exclusive and can be executed both if approved. They are very similar in nature due to their reliance on Abracadabra and therefore will be discussed in this single forum thread.
The first proposal's goal is to use ALCX's value in order to gain Curve gauge voting power through the means of purchasing CVX.
The second proposal's goal is to use ALCX's value in order to diversify into stablecoins and putting those stablecoins to work (and enhance AIP-17).
Current situation
At the moment of writing, the Alchemix treasury holds around 100 million dollars worth of ALCX and around 2.2 million dollars of stablecoins that are currently in the 3pool Convex farm as per AIP-17.
Abracadabra
Abracadabra is a defi protocol that allows users to put up interest-bearing tokens as collateral in order to mint MIM; a USD pegged stable coin similar to DAI and USDC. Abracadabra has an ALCX vault which implies users can deposit ALCX in order to mint MIM. Like MakerDAO, there is a chance of liquidation, but in both proposals I will suggest a conservative and low-risk liquidation price.
You can read more about it in their Medium post.
AIP-20-A: Minting MIM to purchase CVX
As many may have noticed, Convex is taking defi by storm. Convex is a protocol developed on top of Curve that boosts rewards for CRV stakers and liquidity providers alike. As it stands right now, Convex has locked up 93.4m CRV and controls 34.51% of Curve's gauge voting power. That voting power is given to CVX holders that lock up their CVX tokens for roughly 16 weeks.
The first CVX gauge vote will be on the 16th of September, so there's still time for people to lock up their CVX if they want to vote. As it stands 1 CVX holds the voting power of 16.57 CRV (source). This will lower as we get closer and closer to the 16th of September, but it wouldn't be surprising if 1 CVX ends up holding the voting power between 6 and 10 CRV. For the sake of argument, let's assume 1 CVX will hold the voting power of 7 CRV.
We currently have $2.2m in stablecoins farming CVX. Those stablecoins have farmed around 500 CVX, which if we extrapolate linearly (bad assumption for multiple reasons but the most simple to reason with) means we will farm about 15k CVX per year. A rough estimate would tell us that it would take 6-9 years of farming in order to accumulate around 85k CVX.
In this proposal I suggest we take 5% of the ALCX treasury (15000 ALCX) and put it on Abracadabra in order to mint around ~$780k MIM at a liquidation price of $70 at the moment of writing (18.75% of current ALCX price). This is a custom liquidation price that's even lower than what is considered safe ($116), and there are 0 loops involved.
We can then sell that ~$780k MIM  MIM for roughly 58k CVX assuming the price remains around $13.25. This way we can accumulate more CVX way faster than the 6-9 years of farming while the token is not yet relatively scarce. Assuming 7 CRV per locked CVX, this would give us around 0.4m of veCRV voting power.
For reference, our 400 ALCX bribes have shifted 2.4m veCRV votes to alUSD, doubling the gauge rewards. This is however just for a single gauge vote. Buying CVX directly is preferential over bribing CVX holders as this will give us permanent voting power instead of temporary voting power and will most likely pay off in the end. Bribing CVX holders may become more lucrative as CVX gets more scarce and pricier in the future.
Bonus: Locking the CVX up in order to gain voting power yields cvxCRV rewards, which is around 12% APR atm. I would suggest to stake these up together with the rewards of AIP-17 to increase the flywheel effects. The 3crv we earn with staking cvxCRV can also be used to pay off the debt on Abracadabra.
AIP-20-B: Minting MIM to diversify into stables
As you might imply from the current situation, stablecoins are only 2% of Alchemix's portfolio, the other 98% is ALCX (ignoring the other scraps). It's been talked about before, and I too think it's wise to diversify a little bit into stablecoins to reduce risk during market down turns (although we've already had a pretty rough time looking at ALCX price history). The goal of this proposal is to diversify, not to maximize CVX farming output.
In this proposal I suggest we take 5% of the ALCX treasury (15000 ALCX) and put it on Abracadabra in order to mint around ~$780k MIM at a liquidation price of $70 at the moment of writing (18.75% of current ALCX price). This is a custom liquidation price that's even lower than what is considered safe ($116), and there are 0 loops involved.
Instead of selling this ~$780k MIM and taking an active trading position in some other token, I suggest we put it in a Convex alUSD farm which yields between 20% and 25% APR at the moment of writing. In the end we'll have a bigger rainy day stablecoin fund that is being productive by farming more CRV, CVX and ALCX for us. The CRV and CVX can again be staked into Convex for the flywheel effect, similar to AIP-17 and AIP-20-A if it passes. The ALCX can be used to pay back debt or added as extra collateral. This would be almost like selling ALCX for stable coins, except we're not selling any! Another benefit is that in case of an ALCX downturn we can buy additional ALCX using the alUSD to secure the liquidation price of our debt if necessary.
Risk management
Whenever we get close to 50% of the liquidation price because of a falling ALCX price, we should either add collateral or pay back debt such that the liquidation price becomes the original 18.75% that we started with. I think the best course of action is to pay back the debt instead of adding collateral, since adding collateral increases the potential loss instead of decreasing it.
Disclaimer
I personally own CVX and SPELL tokens (13% and 1.5% respectively of my portfolio) and I assume that this will ""be good for my bags"". I hope I can objectively convince you that these proposals are indeed good for Alchemix.
Amendements:

"[""[AIP-20] Diversifying treasury's ALCX holdings without selling""]","""Bags don't dictate my bias, my bias dictates my bags"". IMO it's better that you're holding CVX & SPELL while proposing this since it shows you believe in the protocol enough to get behind it with your own money. I'm all about this, Abra has been synergistic with Alchemix so far so I'd like to see more cooperation between the protocols. "
"[""[AIP-20] Diversifying treasury's ALCX holdings without selling""]","My only worry is that a bear market comes, $91 ALCX doesn't seem crazy. That's only like a 70-80% drop from here. I would add a ""multisig repayment price"", ie if alchemix drops to a certain level, we repay the debt up to a new safe level.
So for ex - If ALCX drops to our preset value of $182 (91x2), we liquidate some of the farms to pay until we are back up to the same approximate leverage we started with (20% I believe). That way we are never really risking paying the liquidation fee.
This way we're always ahead of the liquidations with a predetermined plan."
"[""[AIP-20] Diversifying treasury's ALCX holdings without selling""]","I like the idea, but I think it's too aggressive and risky as currently proposed. Under the current proposal 10% of the entire treasury ALCX would be at risk of liquidation. That's a significant allocation. $91 might seem safe, but we've seen violent moves downwards before and there's no guarantee we won't approach that range at some point in the future. At that point the devs would be scrambling to pay back the loan or lower the liquidation levels, and given the fact that the CVX could be locked for voting purposes, this could put us in a position where we need to spend more treasury stables or collateralize additional ALCX for safety. A slippery slope. Additionally, AIP-20-B would expose us to depegging risk of an asset we have no control over in MIM. I like the project a lot, but I don't fully trust their ability to maintain that peg in perpetuity, and I don't think it's been battle tested enough to consider it safe.
Here are the revisements I would like to see entertained personally:
Change AIP-20-B to use a safer Convex farm. I would advocate for the typical 3Pool (USDT, USDC, DAI). Yield earned would be less, but at least we'd easily be able to pay off the MIM if needed and we would not be exposed to additional peg risk. At the very least we should be splitting liquidity between the two.
A reduction in the treasury allocation devoted to AIP-20-A. We have to assume that at any one time the CVX we purchase will be locked for an extended period and not be able to be used to pay back the Abra loan if needed. To be honest I'm not sure what number makes the most sense here, but 5% seems aggressive exposes us to the aforementioned risks of a larger treasury allocation being needed for fortification in the future. Maybe 2.5% is right? Maybe less? Suggestions are certainly welcome."
"[""[AIP-20] Diversifying treasury's ALCX holdings without selling""]","So we already discussed this quite extensively over on Discord, but here's my two cents:
AIP-20-A
I would support this and this is pretty much the idea as discussed initially. I think this is a lasting way to buy influence for any gauge voting which we will need for current alTokens pools and for future alTokens pools. It's also more sustainable than participating in the bribing game. On top, as you mentioned, it provides a nice income stream for the treasury as well.
Also, I agree with ov3rkoalafied in that we should add an addendum to this proposal that if we the price of ALCX were to drop by x%, we would authorize the treasury to make a payment to avoid liquidation. This could either be by deploying stablecoins or by withdrawing more ALCX and adding this to the collateral position.
AIP-20-B
This to me is more risky and I have reservations about deploying treasury assets in this way. It's true that MIM Convex farming is currently very lucrative but that's mostly because MIM has won the bribing game for now - I don't expect these yields to last, and I don't think the treasury should be speculating in the yield farming game.
I do think that we need to look into diversifying the treasury assets but then I would say lets look at something like UMA, who have an entire product build around DAO treasury diversification.
Dropping 5% of the treasury assets into this strategy exposes us to a lot of risks and to me personally I don't think the rewards are worth it.
Overall
Finally let me just say that with both these proposal we will (again) be moving treasury assets from the timelocked treasury multisig to the dev multisig which is inherently more risky. Don't get me wrong, I trust the devs to manage these assets properly, but I also think this is an inelegant solution and I would rather see a system of treasury proxy contracts (as mentioned earlier here) or some other solution.
In summary, I support AIP-20-A if we add an addendum for emergency situations, but I have several reservations against AIP-20-B."
"[""[AIP-20] Diversifying treasury's ALCX holdings without selling""]","I like the idea. 
I don't find this aggressive (imo) but I hear others concerns. 
Prioritising debt repayments via 3crv rewards would alleviate these concerns. Note, the first cycle of collateral > debt > debt repayment, is always the most concerning as no real data exists prior to extrapolate from. Post the first cycle, it gets very exciting and very interesting. Am for this proposal.
Only additional comment - Alchemix should put out their CVX voting address as some may choose to delegate. 
Further to this point, bribing would be far more efficient at the CVX delegation level than gauge voting on Curve due to the multiplier Convex offers. "
"[""[AIP-20] Diversifying treasury's ALCX holdings without selling""]","I've made a few amendments:
Updated numbers in general to reflect the state of the market. Sadly, CVX price has gone up relative to ALCX, so AIP-20-A would now only yield us 58k CVX instead of 85k CVX.
Lowered liquidation price from 25% of the current price to 18.75% of the current price. This is halfway 12.5% and 25%. I feel going all the way to 12.5% is too conservative and we wouldn't get the most out of this proposal. Even 25% was already below what is considered low risk, as that would require a 75% dump which would bring the ALCX price around 50% below it's ATL
Changed the farming strategy for AIP-20-B from MIM to alUSD. This has several advantages:
a. We do not have to rely on MIM holding peg. Several community members didn't feel safe yet relying on a new and unproven stablecoin.
b. We will be partly providing liquidity to the pool of our own synthetic stablecoin, which is good for the protocol in itself.
c. We will not have to decide what to do with the SPELL rewards.
d. We will be farming back ALCX tokens which can be used to pay back our debt.
e. In case of an ALCX downturn we can buy ALCX using the alUSD to secure the liquidation price of our debt if necessary.
Added a risk management trigger that states we should restore our 18.75% liquidation price target in case we reach 50% of the liquidation price."

['[AIP-19] Desirability of a future revenue sharing model'],"Proposal
The core team has indicated that, as of now, a revenue sharing model for the DAO is not planned to be integrated unless ALCX holders show strong support in favour of such a model & it's led by the community. This proposal is not to outline an exact revenue sharing model (which would be difficult to do before v2 and the DAO are introduced), but to agree as a community that such a revenue sharing model is highly desired and should be discussed and implemented following the DAO launch.
Background
With the ongoing development of v2 and the DAO, it is difficult for the ALCX community to provide anything but a general direction for future implementations. However, it’s clear through discussions on the Discord server that there is a general expectation that treasury funds and ongoing DAO revenue streams should be shared – in one way or another – with ALCX stakers.
At the moment, the treasury earns 10% from every harvest as well as affiliate fees from Yearn. In the future with more users, more assets, and potentially other sources of income, we can expect the treasury funds to keep growing significantly. Meta yield farming has been the name of the game up to this point (which AIP-17 introduced), but unless there is a way to share this revenue and these benefits with ALCX stakers, the ALCX token will have value only for governance but not for utility and/or economic benefits.
To increase the current and especially the future value of ALCX tokens a clear community direction on the use of treasury funds is needed.
Examples
Again, this proposal is not to outline an exact revenue sharing model. To do this we need to have a clear idea of what v2 and the DAO will look like. But to illustrate the value that a revenue sharing model could bring, consider the following examples:
ALCX stakers could receive a direct distribution from the treasury in the form of DAI, ETH, or other assets.
ALCX stakers could use their share of the treasury assets to pay back their outstanding loans.
Assuming that the high rate of ALCX inflation is stopped, treasury assets could also be used to periodically buy back ALCX tokens from the market.
ALCX stakers could receive a distribution in the form of alTokens rather than the “real assets” which would allow the treasury to use the original assets for yield farming, and thus increase the treasury size while still sharing revenue.
…
The point is that there are many ways to bring real utility and economic value to ALCX tokens, and we need to signal that this a) is desired by the community, and b) needs to be developed following the DAO launch.
Vote
A vote for this proposal would signal support for a future revenue sharing model, while a vote against this proposal would signal not to share treasury revenue with ALCX stakers.
As a next step – and assuming this vote passes & DAO is launched – there needs to be a discussion in the DAO on the exact mechanisms of revenue sharing."
['[AIP-19] Desirability of a future revenue sharing model'],"0xFelix 
so firstly i agree with you, long term these are nice have, i hold the stance of ""i don't mind alcx damping a bit more whilst we keep the devs focused on V2 and the DAO and then it can pump after"". So i agree with you on the idea of waiting until after the DAO and V2 for these things.
ALCX stakers could receive a direct distribution from the treasury in the form of DAI, ETH, or other assets.
I dont like this idea and would rather the alAsset approach you mention later as this has the added effect of increasing TVL and adding insurance incase something goes wrong
ALCX stakers could use their share of the treasury assets to pay back their outstanding loans.
this won't be possible until V2 comes out but i do like the idea, but i think it should be prioritised under the rev share
Assuming that the high rate of ALCX inflation is stopped, treasury assets could also be used to periodically buy back ALCX tokens from the market.
The token supply is decreasing over time but it will take 3 years to get to its flat rate so that's a longer term consideration. i think that in a few years if we have the TVL and the volumes to keep an adequate amount of liquidity we may be able to phase out the inflation earlier i think that the rate of inflation should be revisited bi-annually, what do you think?
ALCX stakers could receive a distribution in the form of alTokens rather than the “real assets” which would allow the treasury to use the original assets for yield farming, and thus increase the treasury size while still sharing revenue.
i like this one
option from me
if we generate enough fees then we could sell them to buy alcx to send to the LPers instead and stop the inflation early
over all good post and i think it echos a lot of what people are saying in the discord!"
['[AIP-19] Desirability of a future revenue sharing model'],"I
0xFelix
Love the examples provided.  Just throwing some rough ideas out there.  What if instead of paying direct dividends out al assets or even direct assets like Dai or Eth etc, the dividends provided boost the apy on the current loan the user has out.
For example: V2 is out and a user has a alBtc, alEth, and alUsd loan.  Instead of directly paying dividends out,  the dividends that would have been payed out actually gets allocated to the users using the actual program and said user can choose which vault gets the boosted apy to help pay down the debt quicker.  
This example above promotes the actual use of the protocol and provides a healthy incentive to take more loans out to help generate more yield for treasury etc.

['[AIP-19] Desirability of a future revenue sharing model'],"I like the idea of having everything public and the way how e.x. Bankless DAO is doing this.  I would be nice to get some revenue of course, any  risks here? Probably it will attract more people to DAO and token."
['[AIP-19] Desirability of a future revenue sharing model'],"I agree that gov tokens have to have value beyond just giving you voting power, and thus am in favor of sharing revenue with ALCX holders.
I would like to add this: if we want to (completely) stop the inflation of ALCX then part of the money the protocol makes should imo also go to the SLP and alAsset LP stakers (in the form of BTC, DAI, and/or ETH).
I'm especially in favor of making ETH the go to fee token as it's also the most liquid."
['[AIP-19] Desirability of a future revenue sharing model'],"Although Scoopy has mentioned revenue sharing on podcasts, I think it is premature to vote in favor of revenue sharing over other ways of increasing token value.  There are other ways to enrich ALCX token holders and revenue sharing may not be the optimal model.  Yearn, for instance, started off with a revenue share model and later changed it to YFI buybacks.  Of course, this is just a signaling vote but I think the serious discussions on this can only happen after V2 and the DAO, as was indicated in the AIP.
It will be interesting to see how successful Tokemak becomes.  A successful ALCX reactor may impact this discussion as it relates to inflation."
['[AIP-19] Desirability of a future revenue sharing model'],ImYourHodlberry yea i think that either the devs do the buybacks in inhouse or someone makes one and the community just votes to make it the official one so gets linked into the main site. its the same thing just different route and we then create the opportunity for the devs to focus on more complex and powerful things that not even scoopy has thought of.
['[AIP-19] Desirability of a future revenue sharing model'],"Thanks for starting the convo & putting out a proposal. 100% for a revenue sharing model. Would vote yes if this was on a snapshot vote.
+Agree that the way that it is designed should be informed by the V2 and the DAO development. Ideally with a lot of input from the core team. Think this will happen over the course of weeks & feel we can use this time wisely.
Assuming the core team will be busy buried on other aspects of development, might be beneficial to form a small team from the trusted members of the community to;
Work closely with the core team getting informed about V2 & DAO
Prepare an initial list of considerations + potential routes to take in alignment with the core team.
Share initial thoughts with the community once V2 launches & gather input. 
Consolidate input & the work to set the scene for an informed convo together with the the dao launch.
Not sure if we are in a rush or not 🤷‍♀️ just thought the research & prep for the convo does not need to wait for V2 to be launched & can be run side by side.

['[AIP-19] Desirability of a future revenue sharing model'],"personally think all the value captured should be driven back to increase the SPOT ALCX token price. Why? I imagine ALCX growing into tens of billions of TVL.. i would rather that value be driven to the token than get some payout (revenue) for holding my ALCX. I want to hold ALCX cause i think the spot price will go up over time (value is being created for the token).. not get paid out in basically fiat during an early expansion/growth phase. Paying me some dividend/revenue at this stage of the development is bearish to me.
It's clear we should be using that value creation to grow further and faster/wider and grow into our addressable market.  Paying me out $ right now to me signals that the protocol/dao has no confidence in its ability to grow and believes the value created is best spent enriching stakers.. yikes? if i was amazon in 2003 i wouldnt want a dumb dividend.. roll it back and grow.. get more devs, add more revenue streams, grow the tvl, anything but pay me seriously. Youre paying me in a meta way anyhow by the future spot appreciation of the ALCX token -- much like Amazon did throughout the 2000s. Think longer term here.
where am i wrong here? I have thought about this a lot and i do not see a real counterargument.. the only counterargument would be we're done growing + reached our addressable target market, so it makes more sense to pay out value v roll it back into growing network fx/protocol/dao growth.. free alpha here: if the marginal unit of $1 is true in that way (better served to pay out stakers v use for further growth) i am super bearish (because that would mean ALCX ceiling is much lower than I thought originally).. unironically would want to hold less/no ALCX then. Thoughtful comments appreciated
"
['[AIP-19] Desirability of a future revenue sharing model'],"Kazuya1987 (I will copy-paste my reply from the Discord server here) Let me start by saying that the current proposal is only to initiate this revenue sharing idea. How we do it in practice is an entirely different topic, and there are many ways we can think of. Dividends being just one of them, but buy backs being another (and I'm sure there's more examples).
But to your point: I dont think the comparison to the likes of Amazon really applies. I mean DAOs have low capital requirements and generally high profitability. So it's not that a dollar paid out to stakers is a dollar misspent, as would be the case for Amazon (and I fully agree with this in the case of traditional companies).
Currently the treasury is raking in 10% of every harvest, which is a very nice income stream that doesnt really serve a purpose except to pay current devs & do some yield farming. So of course if there is a good business opportunity I'm all for spending more on that, but I believe that the tradfi idea of ""misusing"" company assets through dividends is a false dichotomy when it comes to web3.
One thing that supports this that is that we dont actually need to spent ""real"" money to pay out a revenue share to stakers. We could use the treasury funds to pay for ongoing developments/opportunities, continue yield farming, and simply mint alTokens to reward stakers. So in essence we can totally do both. (Of course there's a lot of work to be done on determining the exact parameters for this.)
But I understand your reservations and I think this would be a very healthy discussion to have once we actually have a DAO and can start working on this revenue allocation/sharing model."
['[AIP-19] Desirability of a future revenue sharing model'],"Kazuya1987 (copy/paste from Discord)  DirectionalIy i agree with this. Though one thing to consider is that projects in DeFi can moon without warning, causing a huge influx of capital to a team/DAO that isn't experienced in managing that much capital, so in that sense it's like Masayoshi pumping a huge amount of money into an inexperienced startup -- the funds get misspent because they came all at once without sufficient structure/strategy for deployment. And often the company fails outright because the product outpaced the market and went in wild unproven direcections. I don't necessarily think the funds going to the token holders is the correct answer to this kind of ""problem"" but perhaps it'd be a mitigating measure?
One other thing to point out is that it is very ""trendy"" to give value back to token holders so in that sense it will generate a huge amount of visibility and positive press for Alchemix, so it could be a way to rapidly bootstrap growth, and I imagine it could be done in a way where the lion's share is still reserved for re-investment into the product/team.
I do think we also sometimes forget that tokens are not equivalent to common shares in a corporation and in particular tokens do not come with all the comfy shareholder rights and protections, so that's another reason why a comparison to an Amazon in this case is a bit apples to oranges. To me, this lack of true shareholder rights would make a stronger argument for delivering value to token holders early and consistently."
['[AIP-19] Desirability of a future revenue sharing model'],"Kazuya1987 Understand what you mean but I am not sure Amazon is a model that applies well here. We'r simply not operating on same operating costs & we'r not aiming to grow in diverse set of consumer service verticals.  (+ web3 space knows better ways of organising wealth than following the model that created the worlds wealthiest person.)
I think you are right in thinking a good portion of the revenue should be used to keep innovating at a pace that beats the market. Which would fuel future price appreciacion. This is a legitimate concern. But not convinced this has to happen with 100% of the value generated. Think there could be a balance & we can strike that balance thru a healthy convo on parameters. Also think you are underestimating what an engaged community of equity holders (full of builders) could bring in form of innovation. + I'd be ok as an ALCX holder to recieve less from revenue sharing if we needed to fund more development&innovation.

['[AIP-19] Desirability of a future revenue sharing model'],"I'm a huge fan of this idea, but at the right time, so I think your approach of beginning to collect community feedback is the right course. We don't want to stifle the work that still needs to be done, however, I think a model, similar to AAVE, would be interesting where the stakers are securing the protocol and receive rewards for doing so.
The beauty is that we, as a community, can choose many number of ways to reward stakers. I do like the idea of alUSD or some other stable reward, but personally I'm open to all other options and would simply be happy stacking more ALCX. Perhaps it's xALCX that can be used in some way via LPing or as additional collateral?
Either way, I am strongly for rewarding stakers long term. I think it's partly how ALCX keeps a strong community and an even stronger moat, should strong competitors arrive as they are developing V2."
['[AIP-19] Desirability of a future revenue sharing model'],"Hugely in favor of revenue sharing.
First, as has been mentioned above, Web3 DAOs and protocols tend to need far less of a revenue stream than traditional companies, so there should be a happy middle ground for for revenue sharing along with reinvestment into the protocol.
Second, everyone realizes that ALCX stakers being paid a revenue stream will in of itself help the price pump, correct? Who doesn't want a revenue bearing token from a protocol with proven worth, stability, and a unique product with high demand? Demand for ALCX would go way up. You'd get the effects of a buyback, essentially.
Third, lots of people are attracted to Alchemix because they see the financial value of the tool; namely being able to use your capital to purchase things without losing any of the capital, and thus being able to recoup your money from interest paid on your full capital amount, not what you have leftover after your purchases. Making ALCX essentially a dividend stock/token I think goes right in line with people who see economic upside opportunities that they want to take advantage of."
['[AIP-19] Desirability of a future revenue sharing model'],"I like the idea however might be premature at this point and  as this capital could be put to better use be it development, marketing, etc.  Also, whats on the horizon is more gov. regulations and compliance thus must account for this unknown expense.  I'm a wall street 25 year vet so know first hand the massive burdens regs/compliance places on firm and expect this same burden if not greater within the crypto space.  Bottom line like the idea but would be best to consider its implementations say in the next 2-3 years."
['[AIP-19] Desirability of a future revenue sharing model'],"A few quick things while I'm thinking about this now (will hopefully have time to pull and sort through data later to answer other questions) assuming revenue is paid in alAssets. Two strategies I see to make this happen:
1) Harvested yield is used to buy alAssets from the secondary market (good for maintaining/boosting peg) and passed along to stakers who then decide if/when to trade them for their actual useful counterparts since that will only be feasible after a certain threshold is reached (if paid 1 alUSD, 0.0001 alETH, per ALCX per week then it only makes sense to pay for gas to trade for DAI/ETH after X weeks). This does cost stakers more though so actual APY for stakers would always be lesser than what is displayed due to multiple gas costs.
pros
-boosts/maintains peg
-always possible (assuming there is always a secondary market)
cons
-staking APY is always lower than advertised
-stakers are paid in dust which may take time to amount to anything useful
2) Harvested yield is used to create rev-sharing vaults from which alAssets are borrowed to pay stakers. This does nothing in terms of peg, but could run into problems if there is nothing available to be borrowed. This could boost yield for rev-stakers as each time more and more would be able to be borrowed (your interest would be compounding) so it would really be a trade off of APY up front for greater APY later as well as more stability in staking APY since the compounded interest would dampen any periods of low usage.
pros
-constantly growing yield for stakers
-boosts Alchemix TVL
-signals confidence in protocol
-more consistent/less volatile APY
cons
-may not be able to withdraw alAssets to pay stakers (or would have to prioritize this over individual users of the protocol
-much lower upfront APY (even less dust that may take even longer to amount to anything)

['[AIP-19] Desirability of a future revenue sharing model'],"I absolutely agree that ALCX holders should benefit from revenue sharing. A couple of thoughts, based on the discussion around this post so far:
I think that part—though probably not all—of this revenue sharing should take the form of direct payouts of DAI, ETH, or al-assets to holders. We should obviously take plenty of time to discuss the pros and cons of this approach, but I'd like to go ahead and register my disagreement with the argument that a ""dividend"" comes at the expense of growth. I think direct payouts have a place alongside buybacks, APY boosts for loans, and of course reinvestment (hiring, advertising, etc)—at all stages of growth.
One question: would these payouts need to be harvested, or would they be dropped in users' wallets? Is there a third option? If possible it would be nice to avoid users' having to pay the gas costs to claim shared revenue, although we'd have to take into account the expense that would represent to the treasury."

I believe wholeheartedly that this revenue stream should be in the form of Alassets/stablecoins.  This allows the DAO to keep and provide more boosted yield which in turn flows to stakers.
I believe that stakers should be subject to slashing (up to a percentage established by the DAO).
I believe that the protocol should also use it's own product.  I love the alpha Scoop leaked on Goodwill Yunting Podcast.  Let the treasury deploy itself to the protocol.  Max borrow.  And pay out to stakers.  As harvests are called rinse repeat.  This also has the benefit of using the treasury to grow the treasury through yield. "

['Autocompound ALCX staking rewards'],"Hi - Would it be possible to have ALCX staking rewards autocompound vs having to do this manually? I'm staking ALCX and the ALCX/ETH SLP. In order to claim the rewards for both, I have to perform two transactions (which can be quite expensive).
So, a few ideas:
Optimal: Let rewards autocompound (Take all ALCX rewards and stake it in the pure ALCX pool)
Sub-optimal, but better: Let all ALCX rewards flow into one location so I only need to claim rewards once (vs 2x)
Hoping something like this comes in v2."
['Autocompound ALCX staking rewards'],"Yeah this has been a big pain point for me as well. Auto compounding would be really great
"
['Rough Idea for ALCX Revenue Sharing'],"Here’s my idea for ALCX DAO and Staking. The overall goal is to share revenue, maintain treasury funds to pay for protocol fees, and to incentivize active participation. Here’s my outline to achieve this. Actual math to follow once I get some missing data.
[Revenue Sharing Model] Those who stake ALCX in the DAO will be entitled to revenue share. The eligible treasury assets (ETH, DAI) will be deposited to the DAI vault. A half-maximum loan would be taken (12.5% for ETH, 25% for DAI). The remaining loan value would be available for protocol expenses. The initial loan would then be distributed to stakers (as alAssets) to effectively “boost” staking yield over some period of determined time, which would taper off as TVL in the protocol increases. Each week (or day or month) the loan would be re-upped to the 12.5% and 25% loan values and distributed to stakers. The end result is maintaining treasury collateral for emergencies, providing better initial staking rewards while TVL is lower, and maintaining a revenue stream for protocol expenses.
[Uses for Shared Revenue] Users will accumulate alAsset yield (weekly?) that can be used in the following ways:
Withdrawn
Left to accumulate - **The idle alAssets being accumulated could potentially be used to provide alAsset liquidity, removing the need for users to provide it themselves, removing or reducing the need for LP incentives?!?*
Used to auto-repay debt for the address
Auto-converted to ALCX, which is auto-staked (adds buy pressure to ALCX and creates essentially an ALCX autocompound single stake option)
[DAO/Gamefi] What we know about GameFi (materia points and shards, etc) is unaffected. To encourage participation, we want voting to have a large weight on your share of rewards. However, then we have a dilemma between giving everyone a lot of time to participate in votes (so they don’t miss boosted rewards), and actually getting things done. A few ideas:
Allow a certain percentage of missed votes per month, with a minimum of 1 allowed missed vote. Users would be rewarded with their materia points/shards for these votes.
The amount of materia points rewarded for a vote is proportional to the amount of ALCX the proposer has (or, assuming there is a minimum amount of ALCX required to propose, this may not be necessary.)
Vote delegation settings - a setting where if I do not vote before the vote expires, my vote is automatically set to align with the vote of a delegated address. 
Some initial math indicates we may be able to pay for everything in the AIP-16 budget with this strategy, though I would propose we use some ALCX for the budget to maintain/increase treasury diversification."
['Rough Idea for ALCX Revenue Sharing'],"ov3rkoalafied I think this is a quite interesting idea, and think that integrating the DAO into the staking rewards could be very beneficial. on the concept of delegation; if your don't want to participate in the DAO then you can delegate your ALCX but you then in turn don't get any DAO NFTs or materia points. I think that that is quite important, minimum involvement = minimum rewards which I guess is the whole point of this?
on your bit about 50% of max loan, the DAO could always self liquidate instead which I think is what Scoopy has mentioned. I think some sort of auto compounding feature would be very important, but I would expect a 3rd part to build it instead and then its integrated into the DAO instead of asking the devs to build it. I think that if we got a closer integration between the DAO and the treasury that might be a better plan, as the DAO could max borrow and give 1/2 to us and the other 1/2 to a SushiSwap pool with the DAOs ALCX on the other side, this would mean that over time we can build up more liquidity for the auto compounding feature. what do you think? I know Scoopy has thought about the DAO being able to provide its own liquidity so this could be a good first step?
"
['Rough Idea for ALCX Revenue Sharing'],"Biddls 
Yeah, min involvement should = minimum rewards. However, if we want to get proposals approved quickly we are always going to have people missing votes, and I don't want people to be too heavily punished for having a life as long as they are generally voting often.
My idea didn't have a solution for the ALCX/ETH liquidity, so your idea helps solve that.. but the cost is that now for any protocol expenses we need to self-liquidate, which I don't like as it reduces total collateral collecting yield. Maybe there's a balance.
And agreed the auto-compound can likely just be done by a 3rd party"
['Rough Idea for ALCX Revenue Sharing'],"ov3rkoalafied Yes so what about on voting the punishment is delayed, so lets say its an emergency we need to do something quickly and we give it 1 day to vote on. as long as you vote in the week after you dont miss out on any rewards? we could mby add in some decay so you get more rewards the sooner after voting ends than at the end of the week? that could be an interesting idea.
for the liquidity problem I don't think that the max borrowing will go on for ever we will create enough liquidity to have the auto compounding work easily and then stop and go back to 50% of max borrow. or we could not pay out any dividends borrow at 50% max until we have enough liquidity and then switch to paying people out? it wont be able to last for ever any way as there is only so much alcx that the dao can put into those pools."
['Rough Idea for ALCX Revenue Sharing'],"I brought this up on the AIP-19 proposal, but don't see it addressed here. How can we ensure that a loan can be taken? If a vault has 0 available alAssets to be borrowed, then this breaks down and we either have to forego providing revenue sharing to the ALCX stakers or build in a priority function so that the rev-sharing vaults are always able to borrow first following each harvest which I could see severely limiting the ability for individual users to borrow.
Also, this ensures there is always the maximum amount of alAssets which could de-stabilize the peg if rev-sharing people trade their share for other, more useful assets (assuming alAssets still have no use-case besides LPing/farming)."
['Rough Idea for ALCX Revenue Sharing'],"Franky 
Your questions both have the same solution, which is more use cases for alUSD and alETH (mostly in the form of being accepted collateral in various protocols). Which the devs have mentioned multiple times they are pursuing - but I agree that if there aren't many more use cases by the time the DAO is ready, then it would be harder to keep increasing the debt cap. The treasury funds are really not that large right now compared to the total debt caps, so I think we have a lot more time on this issue than you think. We could almost just auto-raise the debt cap each time the treasury draws a new loan, since it really wouldn't be that large of a raise.
For the max alAssets, same thing - it's max for the treasury, but again the treasury isn't THAT big, so it would be a marginal amount of additional alAssets. The treasury has less than 10m DAI, isn't the debt cap like 200m DAI or something? alETH may be harder at first since the merge will happen after the DAO most likely, so alETH may not be included at first in the treasury payout."
['Rough Idea for ALCX Revenue Sharing'],"Here's how I think the numbers would work out, comparing if we just simply shared all new yield vs using my method. For 1 year it approximately doubles the yield for stakers. Don't focus too much on the #'s themselves (since I'm assuming all ALCX is staked and current TVL, all of which are highly conservative), more on the fact that we can boost the effective yield while also affording the monthly budget, potentially needing to sell a bit of ALCX the first little while: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQANE9zwkrrSvL6iNjSB3ZhE0lXj-5CAbbnLKroLdtZ5AtQ4JT8EkrQ_m1zSyi8GJkndrt1I98KnROH/pubhtml
and for anyone freaking out cuz ""omg yield so low"", say TVL increases 10x and only half ALCX is staked (and I think almost everything the devs have hinted at indirectly or directly allows for massive TVL increases), that's an annual yield of $160/token. Even at 20 P/E or whatever the unit is, that's a $3200/token price. Also like 100 alcx right now is about 32k. In 6 months that's probably around 140 ALCX. 140x$160 = 22.4k per year in dividends. Ie, this feels like it has potential to be an incredible interest bearing asset. If you pie in the sky it and say we go 100x TVL from here, then a 10 alcx buy today for 3.2k could be giving you 22.4k/year someday in the future (soon TM)
math not entirely accurate as you'd eliminate the ""boost"" to staking rewards, but at that point the TVL would outweigh it by so much it shouldn't change the #'s that much"
['Rough Idea for ALCX Revenue Sharing'],"ov3rkoalafied i think you messed up your math slightly
$160/token. Even at 20 P/E or whatever the unit is, that's a $3200/token price. Also like 100 alcx right now is about 32k. In 6 months that's probably around 140 ALCX. 140x$160 = 22.4k
if we assume that now everyone has 40% more ALCX (100 => 140) then the same amount of coins has to go between 40% more ALCX meaning that everyone gets $160/1.4 per ALCX in dividends. a 20PE assumes a dividend yield of 5%, this doesn't take into account price changes from selling alAsset for ALCX if we are doing the auto compounding because then if we are constantly buying up ALCX and staking it then we are getting less yield but increasing our capital gains instead."
['Rough Idea for ALCX Revenue Sharing'],ov3rkoalafied yea I mean talking about liquidity for the DAO if we assume a once per week auto compounding then all we need is to have enough liquidity to be able to sell a weeks worth of dividends into the pool for ALCX?

['[AIP-18] Bribe the alUSD3CRV Gauge'],"Proposal: Bribe the alUSD3CRV gauge on curve.fi.f
Recently, Andre Cronje has released a dapp called bribe.curve.finance. This allows you to put bribes or bounties up for veCRV voters in order for them to be incentivised to vote for gauge weights (which determine farming rewards per pool) and other governance proposals in Curve DAO.
The idea seemed like a cute experiment, but recently, our friends over at abracadabra.money have offered robust bribes which has allowed their gauge to now get 5.5% of the CRV rewards. Scoopy Trooples had incentivised approximately $6,000 value in bribes over the last two weeks. Our total votes and rewards increased mildly, but nowhere near as drastically as abracadabra’s MIM.
Therefore, I propose that we use 15% of the weekly farming rewards (400 ALCX) to bribe veCRV voters to vote for our gauge. Currently, the alUSD3CRV farm makes 11.6% in ALCX and 2.03%-5.08% in CRV. Should this bribe allow us to match abracadabra’s success with 5% of veCRV voters voting for our gauge, then it would roughly double the yield on CRV. If that happens, the range for the CRV rewards would go to 4-10%. A 10% reduction in ALCX rewards would mean that ALCX APR would go from 11.6% to 9.86%. At the base reward rate for Curve of 4%, that would put minimum APR at roughly the same level as it is now. That said, people with veCRV and all stakers on Convex get boosted rewards. The boosted CRV rewards would also mean boosted CVX rewards. Currently, we are projected to earn 18.5% on Convex. Around 7% of our yield on convex comes from CRV and CVX, and if our CRV yields would double, then so would our CVX yields.
When you take those factors into consideration, we can have a net increase in yield by at least a few % points while not emitting any extra ALCX in the process. On Convex, our yields could jump from 18% to the mid 20% level.
In order to implement this, we will initially borrow 400 ALCX from the treasury, and then we will adjust the farming reward rate and reimburse the treasury for facilitating this action. Then we will use 400 ALCX a week (of the roughly 2700/week current allotment) to bribe the alUSD gauge.
Reasons for:
-will likely increase yield without increasing emissions
-higher yields will help promote better peg stability
-will provide useful data should we pursue this path for other assets on Curve
-more farming rewards in the form of CRV and CVX
Reasons against:
-there is no guarantee that this will result in higher yields
-bribing voters “feels wrong”
-less ALCX for those who are specifically farming for it (and not the yields)

I think projects bribing voters is an inevitable outcome, and therefore support that we get in to see what bribe numbers work in out favor. At first glance it doesn't ""feel right"" indeed, but by putting morality over what is rational we'll do the opposite of helping the protocol.

It also does not give up the governance tokens, so if any particular Curve voter does thing a pool is ""not worthy"" for whatever reason, they can abstain from the bribe, giving Curve voters ultimate power over their governance. This is better than say, borrow a governance token and vote however you like type model where the governance token lender does not have a say in the ultimate vote cast. "

['Who is on the other side of the trade?'],"Hi folks, checking this out after listening to the Bankless podcast episode.
I've been involved in Bitcoin since 2013 and the ENS project, peripherally since 2017, I'm new to DeFi.
What I can't understand about this program is this:
If I deposit now and get my future yield now (as a borrowing), then somehow for it to make business sense, there has to be somebody on the other side borrowing my collateral at a higher yield than what I'm getting, right?
If we're essentially end-running a bank, the overall dynamic is still the same isn't it? You take in funds and pay interest on them, loan them out at a higher rate of interest, capture the spread - in its purest form, that's what a bank does (setting aside fractional reserve banking, etc).
So if we're cutting the bank out and being our own middle-man, there still needs to be some entity on the other side of this who is paying a higher rate of interest or we're doing something very odd (or circular).
Also, there were numerous references in the podcast to staking stablecoins and deriving base return there, are they saying you get paid in the order of 15% to stake stablecoins? And if so, same question there, who is on the other side of that 15% to make the stablecoin yield viable?
Is there something to all this I'm missing? Because otherwise it seems like somewhere, there's a circular reference, albeit a very convoluted one.
"
['Who is on the other side of the trade?'],"markjr The closest ""real world"" analogy to this would be what was previously known as ""Certificate of Deposit (CD) Loans"". In a CD loan, the borrower borrows against the CD at a very low or even zero interest rate, since the CD itself generates a yield that is picked up by the lending bank and makes up for the ""discounted"" borrowing rate.
Usually this would be the case where the CD is for an asset that is in high demand - one example where this used to happen a lot was in Southeast Asia in the 80s, where business owners who had surplus USD could deposit their USD into local banks for mid teens % sort of yields as USD was in shortage locally. By depositing the CD as collateral, they could borrow against that at close to zero borrowing cost.
In the case of Alchemix, you're taking a DAI (effectively USD) balance and buying a ""floating-rate bond"" which yields say 12% on Yearn, and locking it up in a smart contract escrow to withdrawing 50% of that face value in alUSD.
What's the point of all of this you may ask? Why not just spend 50% upfront?
Well you could, but once that 50% is spent you're left with 50% in assets. With Alchemix, you get to keep that 100% asset base, spin up a 50% liability against it for 50% cash up front, spend the cash and still have a means of regenerating that 100% again assuming yields hold up. It's about levering up balance sheet size in a controlled manner.
And if all goes wrong and you need to hit the liquidate button to release the remaining 50% of your collateral, you are at worst in the same situation as if you just spent the 50%. More likely than not, you would've made some collateral back from the Yearn deposits.
To put it in a different way, it's like buying a bond and borrowing against it for 50% of face value at the same time. Why would you want to do that? Because you want an income-producing asset (bond) but also would like to access some of that cash upfront. Makes sense with bonds, makes sense with DAI too.
Who's the counterparty for the ""bond""? As PhiMarHal points out above, it's everyone that is generating demand for stablecoins, with boosted yields from Yearn coming as a function of its staked position of veCRV and other yield enhancements."
['Who is on the other side of the trade?'],"Alchemix uses Yearn vaults to farm stablecoins. This is where the 15% is coming from. Now who is on the other end of that trade?
gamblers, traders, who believe they can profit from crypto volatility. In a space where prices can move 30% in a day when a car enthusiast tweets, the ability to borrow even at 25% APR, which comes down to just 0.06% a day, seems like a bargain.
speculators buying up governance tokens. It's common in DeFi to drip governance tokens through farms, much like Alchemix itself does. A protocol like Yearn harvests these governance tokens and sells them, to boost returns further."
['Who is on the other side of the trade?'],PhiMarHal I can borrow on dydx for a 0.5% interest rate. Where is the 25% coming from? 
['Who is on the other side of the trade?'],"I appreciate these answers.
So @PhiMarHal 's answer to me suggests that on the other side of Yearn, there is a combination of counterparties willing to borrow at more than 15% (or whatever the current yield is), combined with governance token farming, and, I assume, Yearn takes a small transaction fee? All together come out at a rate higher than the yield they're paying, it would have to, right?
And would it be fair to say that out here in the DeFi world, even over in Bitcoin-land where the miners are lending their BTC at 4% to 6% while depositors are getting even higher (Nexo, e.g) and 200% collaterization on borrows is normal that this  more accurately reflects the true market price for money and risk, absent all the interventions we see in the fiat world?"
['Who is on the other side of the trade?'],"Yep it's worth taking a look at say AAVE, where it's quite clear how you would relate this to a traditional banking model of deposit rate, lending rate, net interest margin (on floating rates) and a higher, but fixed, rate on offer too (like a fixed rate term loan).
Ultimately the rate that we see is market driven, a representation of the opportunity cost of those tokens, which is itself a function of what each token is entitled to, as well as the amount of leverage behind each deposit. On a platform like Alpha, for example, it's (at risk of simplifying too much) like Yearn but with leverage applied to your underlying notional deposit - hence the juiced up yields. Nothing comes for free, as one would expect, but everything ties up nicely numbers wise.
The one thing I'd add on when comparing vs fiat is that there naturally exists a barrier to flows, in that fiat money supply isn't seamlessly connected into the crypto world. There are onramps and offramps but these remain quite expensive, and there's also a divide in opinion: the fiat people don't want to move fiat into crypto because they're skeptical, and the crypto people don't want to move crypto back out and want to build returns within crypto. So there's a natural constraint in new money supply coming in, at the same time utilisation of whatever's already in the system is getting ramped up by new projects that are pushing capital efficiency. That's probably why in aggregate you're seeing double digit USD stablecoin yields inside crypto and DeFi vs close to zero yields in real world fiat.
At least, that's how I look at it. Hope this helps!"
['[AIP-17] - A Convex treasury stablecoin strategy'],"Proposal
In this post I propose an alternative strategy for the treasury stablecoin funds that will increase the return of said stablecoins, increase the alUSD Curve pool TVL and boost CRV rewards for alUSD Curve liquidity providers.
Current situation
At the moment of writing, the Alchemix treasury holds around 143 million dollars worth of ALCX, 5.1 million dollars worth of ETH and 2.25 million dollars worth of DAI. Of those 2.25 million DAI around 1.75 million dollars is being farmed with:
850 thousand - Aave
700 thousand - Yearn
235 thousand - Cream
Curve
Alchemix currently has an alUSD Curve pool with a TVL of around 480 million dollars. This pool is incentivized by providing CRV and ALCX rewards, and the size of those CRV rewards depend on the gauge weight of the pool, which currently sits around 2% of the total gauge.
Convex
Instead of just providing liquidity on this pool, the Alchemix team suggests users to also stake their LP tokens on Convex. Convex is a protocol developed on top of Curve that boosts rewards for CRV stakers and liquidity providers alike. Users can lock their CRV tokens on the Convex platform to earn additional rewards, and so far the amount of CRV under control of Convex has grown to around 74 million CRV, which implies that Convex controls more than 27% of all veCRV. In a recent post the Convex team has announced that they will allow gauge weight voting by CVX holders, Convex's native token. With 17 million CVX tokens in circulation, this means that one single CVX token holds the voting power of more than 4 veCRV. Convex is already the biggest player on the voting playground and shows no sign of stopping its growth and share of all veCRV.
Suggestion
Numbers and percentages are open for discussion, but I propose that we allocate a certain amount of the currently farmed stablecoins to the alUSD Curve pool and stake those LP tokens on Convex. This will allow Alchemix to farm both CRV and CVX tokens, of which the CVX tokens can be used to vote for alUSD on the gauge, increasing the CRV rewards liquidity providers will receive. The farmed CRV tokens can either be sold or staked in Convex to earn farm more CVX. I would suggest the latter as it again increases the voting power of each farmed CVX token. Note that staking the farmed CRV in Convex doesn't mean it can't be sold later. In return for staking CRV tokens you get liquid cvxCRV tokens that can be sold again for CRV (and thus back to other tokens such as DAI or ETH).
There is one caveat however: as part of the Alchemix incentives program, the treasury itself will now also earn ALCX tokens. This makes it look as if Alchemix is paying itself and not the users. I don't know if this is possible, but if so it is desired to blacklist the treasury address from receiving these ALCX tokens. An alternative strategy would be to not put the stablecoins in the alUSD pool, but in a different one such as 3pool, susd, compound or aave. This will in turn not increase the TVL of the alUSD pool, but on the other hand the protocol will also not 'steal' rewards from the alUSD liquidity providers.
This stablecoin strategy also introduces additional (mainly smart-contract) risks, and thus my suggestion is to not ape in all stablecoin funds but to allocate a portion of funds already being farmed with. This percentage can be increased over time as the team gets more comfortable with this strategy.
Future
This strategy will work for any asset held by the Alchemix treasury that has a CRV incentivized Curve pool. This means that we for example can also apply this strategy to the WETH currently in held by the treasury by putting that WETH in an ETH Curve pool, such as seth, steth, or in the future maybe aleth.
Disclaimer
I personally own cvxCRV and CVX tokens and I assume that this will ""be good for my bags"". I hope I can objectively convince you that this is indeed also good for Alchemix."
['[AIP-17] - A Convex treasury stablecoin strategy'],"I fully agree that we should take a more active stance when it comes to treasury funds. The idea of meta yield farming is something that becomes more and more attractive the bigger the treasury grows, and of course with v2 coming we can expect the treasury to continue to grow rapidly.
When it comes to meta yield farming it's good to see some assets have already been engaged through Aave, Yearn & Cream. To me Curve & Convex would be a natural extension of this, and we wouldn't be the first protocol to do so. Recenty FRAX and Olympus have also deposited assets into Convex to farm CRV & CVX tokens. I would also support keeping these tokens & staking them on Convex so that the treasury can influence gauge voting in the future (which would help the alUSD and potentially the alETH pools on Curve in the future). Of course one note of caution would be that Convex is still relatively new, so I would propose to start with a low amount and evaluate our position over time.
Looking at the currently available treasury funds (517k DAI & 400k USDC) I would propose to deposit in the range of 100-250k as a first step.
In terms of pools my suggestion would be to go for the 3pool (DAI, USDC, USDT). This avoids the issue of the treasury claiming ALCX, and the projected APR of that pool is 13.78% vs. 17.54% of the alUSD pool (of which 12.68% is ALCX rewards). Both the 3pool and the alUSD pool have exposure to USDT, which is not desirable from my point of view, but unfortunately there's not really anyway to avoid that in most Curve pools.
Disclaimer from my side as well: I also own cvxCRV and CVX tokens."
['[AIP-17] - A Convex treasury stablecoin strategy'],"Hello,
Happy to make my first contribution in the forum. Glad to be a part as a pleb. + Would like to disclose that i am a cvx & crvcvx holder too. That being said;
Supportive of the idea to put the treasury funds to use thru a stable meta yield farming strategy. Happy to hear that they are already in use thru Aave, Yearn, Cream too. If our treasury is heavy on stables CVX certainly is a great addition to that stack for maximising yield with our treasury funds for sure.
For the pools, if we already have stables in above mentioned protocols, i think it'd be best to start by deploying in their pools in Convex 🙂 It would be the easiest, cheapest & least risky +  it would strenghten our relationship with these protocols.
When it comes to gaining influence in gauge voting thru accumulating veCRV(or equivalent): 100% agree having an influence over CRV gauge votes is an important asset. However not sure if farming it out of Convex over a long period is the best idea, would ask, why not buy CVX now & stake while it is still considerably underpriced?
Another way to influence CRV votes thru deploying stablecoins can be partnering with other protocols that have a pool in CRV (MIM? FRAX? FEI?) and deploying stables in their pools (and them to ours, hence the partnership) essentially consolidating a veCRV vote block that drives an aligned agenda. Would bring user/holder communities closer too.
Note: if we end up investing in our own pool, suggest we burn the earned ALCX instead of blacklisting it from rewards. Would accumulate faster wealth for the rest of the treasury by making it more scarce (which is mostly ALCX)
Hope the above makes sense, thanks Alunara  for writing the proposal, looking forward to the conversation. "
['[AIP-17] - A Convex treasury stablecoin strategy'],"I don't think convex finance is sufficiently battleproof in terms of security yet.

['[AIP-17] - A Convex treasury stablecoin strategy'],"I cannot edit the original post anymore, so I'll post the amendments made during the AIP-17 call here:
For now the plan will be to put the stablecoins in the Curve 3pool and stake the LP tokens on Convex. This is deemed to be the most neutral pool and also brings in 3CRV tokens that can be considered raw yield/income on our deposit. In the future we might decide to move (a part) over to the alUSD pool. Doing so has several benefits such as dogfooding our own protocol assets and building trust.
We currently have stablecoin farm positions in Aave, Yearn and Cream. We also hold raw USDC. The plan is to migrate all these funds to the 3crv pool such that the stablecoins will reside in a single farm.
In addition to CVX and 3CRV, the treasury will also receive CRV rewards. The plan for now is to convert them to cvxCRV and stake on Convex to farm more CVX (and CRV + 3CRV). In other words, we'll be compounding our rewards. We leave the option open to unstake the cvxCRV and convert it to CVX if that gives us more voting power (and we decide that we want to maximize said voting power).
After 3 months, somewhere in November, we will reflect on this strategy and make adjustments if needed. We could then also possible decide to apply this strategy to the ETH funds in our treasury if that sounds like a good plan."
['[AIP-17] - A Convex treasury stablecoin strategy'],👍 
['[AIP-17] - A Convex treasury stablecoin strategy'],"Great suggestion to put the treasury dollars to work for the protocol. There'll be some risk factors involved:

['How to invest treasury funds - Proxy contracts'],"Henlo frens,
I already put this on the governance proposals channel in Discord, but I just thought I would post it here as well for better visibility & discussion.
As we now start to use our treasury funds in a more active manner (""meta yield farming"", see AIP-17), I think we also need to consider how we can organize this in the best way possible. Currently the treasury is on a 5/8 multisig with timelock which is great for security, but less great for active investing, harvesting & compounding. Every transaction requires quite a bit of cat herding and every action we want to perform will have high transactions costs. But, in order to boost the treasury funds, we will need to do regular harvesting & compounding.
An alternative to this would be to set up an allocator/proxy contract that bridges the general treasury multisig and the farming protocol. Essentially this would work as follows: the treasury allocates funds to the proxy contract, and the proxy contract deposits these funds in the farming protocol. The proxy contract also has a harvest/compounding function that anyone can call, which would basically take the funds from the farming protocol and either compound them or send them back to the treasury multisig. Obviously this needs to be set up securely and properly so that funds can only ever be compounded or returned to the treasury, but not send to third party addresses. This way the devs or active community members can call this function whenever we reach an optimal compounding point (gas will have to be paid by the user calling the function though).
I took this idea from OlympusDAO who use these proxy contracts for all their treasury farming/investments (Sushi, Aave, Convex). For inspiration you can see the contract they use for Convex here.
The only downside I see to setting things up this way is that it would require a bit of dev time which would take away from ongoing v2 work. But, on the other hand, I think it's also essential that we think about the optimal path for investing treasury funds. "
['How to invest treasury funds - Proxy contracts'],"I fully support this proposal, it's a great suggestion in my opinion. This makes a lot of sense especially if we start diversifying our treasury investment in a bunch of different farms.
I don't think that this is a very time sensitive or critical project to deliver before v2, but it would be very nice to have depending on the team's velocity."
['How to invest treasury funds - Proxy contracts'],This would indeed be nice to have. Gas cost could be refunded to the harvester from the rewards that are being harvested.
['V2 Analyst Coverage'],"Hello all,
I recently joined the research team at Messari and am interested in writing a detailed Messari Enterprise report on V2 to coincide with the official launch. Given the secrecy of the details of V2, I would need access to the details of V2 so I have time to bring the report to life in time for V2's launch. Happy to sign an NDA or whatever needs to happen to make this work.
I've been a long time supporter of Alchemix and will continue to share its innovation with anyone that will listen. You can read a previous article I wrote about Alchemix this spring here. I think this would be a great way to showcase the power of V2 to an educated audience."

['Stake ALCX - Heighten Borrow Limit'],"This is just a thought I had, maybe more knowledge community members can help tell me why this wouldn't be feasible but I was wondering if the aiUSD Borrow Rate could be boosted by allowing people to stake ALCX. People who Stake a certain amount of ALCX could get a tiered amount of % increases like 1 inch does with their Gas Refund. As an example it could work like this:
50% Borrow  ----  No ALCX Staked
55% Borrow  ----  1 ALCX Staked
60% Borrow  ----  5 ALCX Staked
65% Borrow  ----  10 ALCX Staked
70% Borrow  ----  100 ALCX Staked
This would give the token greater utilitiy and create a ""locking mechanism"" since people would have to first reduce their borrow rate before withdrawing their ALCX. At the same time the Platform would extend it's utility for users, it's a win win however you look at it and 70% seems perfectly reasonable as compared to other platforms like abracadabra that are keeping borrow rates on stables as high as 90%.

['alUSD farm'],"Hello,
Last week I finally converted some ETH and deposited some DAI into Alchemix. First I tried converting alUSD directly for ALCX on sushiswap but I guess that doesn't work, but it will still let you try and charge transaction fees.  Could someone please confirm the only way to trade for ALCX is by trading ETH? (or staking/collecting rewards).
After that I staked my alUSD in the farm.  When I logged in today I see the alUSD farm is retired.  Is there any calendar or post that talks about when farms will be retired?  I wouldn't have staked knowing it was going to be retired the week after.  Now I get pegged with extra transaction fees to withdraw, exchange, re-stake.  Granted I didn't start with that much, and I understood the risks, but it's starting to feel pretty pointless when there's >150 USD equivalent of transaction fees.
Is there no staking options for alUSD now?  The only thing I can do is exchange?
Thanks!"
['alUSD farm'],"You can swap almost anything for ALCX using tools like Zapper or Paraswap. Although the countertoken has to be on the Ethereum blockchain. I'm not aware of cross-chain-swap tools that offer swapping ALCX. And you can also earn ALCX by providing liquidity to the Sushiswap pool, receiving SLP and staking those in the Alchemix SLP farm.
With regards to the alUSD pool, that was really bad timing on your end. The decision to cut it off was made in late May by the community. See the snapshot vote at https://snapshot.org/#/alchemixstakers.eth/proposal/QmZdh2qPzXdV7HKya4EoUNtbJnGturvUkbw1ytskez1r46 for more details.

['[AIP-16] August-October Budget Request'],"Alchemix Treasury Budget Request:
Up until this point, when the Alchemix dev team has needed to use treasury funds to pay a developer or purchase a service we have executed these payments without any governance action. Most of these payments were under $10,000 each, but audit payments have already gone over $100,000. These payments needed to happen, so we unilaterally executed them.
However, the goal of Alchemix is full decentralization. In a move to be more transparent and more decentralized, the Alchemix core development team will request a quarterly budget with estimations of budgetary items. Additionally, we shall follow up with data on how these funds are spent so that the community will see with full transparency how we manage our treasury.
Budget Request for Aug-Oct 2021: $400,000

For solidity developers, one of our part timers is becoming full time, and we are bringing in another solidity dev. We may also contract other devs for part-time solidity work. Alchemix v2 website is getting a complete revamp and makeover. For this effort, we have brought in two more part time front end devs and have been working with a fantastic UX designer. We may also look to expand the team ever further, so this number could increase.
For Alchemix security, we have been audited by Certik (and our forks have been audited too ;p) and have an active bug bounty on Immunify. In total, we have paid out a little over $10k for bug reports which have helped us patch some minor vulnerabilities. We have also engaged Runtime Verification to audit our v2 code. We have made one payment of $55,000 USDC to them so far, and the second one will be due soon. We would like to continue our relationship with them through the release of V2, the Alchemix DAO and beyond, and will need continued funds to do so.
The Alchemix team also pays for numerous services including nansen, infura, vercel, gitbook, discord bots, and others. These services in aggregate cost ~$2000/month and may increase as we are getting close to our plans’ limits.
The August-October budget request of $400,000 will give the Alchemix team plenty of flexibility in managing payroll, operations, and security. At minimum, we must spend approximately ⅔ of this budget on our talent and for the audit. We expect that we will increase our spending as we add developers and pay for additional audits. Any unused funds at the end of this period will be returned to the treasury and the team will make an additional budget request for the next period before this period expires.
The funds will be stored in a 3/5 multisig held by co-founders: 0xDerivadev, scoopy trooples, Gorby, n4n0, and thetechnocratic. We will make DAO payments from this wallet. This would ensure that no one dev has the power to misuse the funds. 0x9e2b6378ee8ad2A4A95Fe481d63CAba8FB0EBBF9 is the dev multisig address.

['A quick primer to Alchemix gas costs'],"Alchemix charges no direct fees for using the protocol. However, as Alchemix exists on the Ethereum blockchain, every action requires a transaction, paid to the Ethereum miners in gas fees.
If you're new to Alchemix, perhaps you wonder: is this worth it for me? How much money do I need to make a self-repaying loan economically viable?
This topic is an attempt to explain gas costs, and index Alchemix-related gas costs in an accessible format.

1) ETHEREUM TRANSACTION GAS COST
Ethereum transactions are priced with two mechanics: gas price, and gas limit.
""Gas price"" is speed. The more you spend on gas price, the more likely a miner will confirm it fast.
Gas prices can vary widely with network demand. At the moment of this writing, gas prices move between 6 gwei in the quiet hours and 30-40 gwei during busier times.
""Gas limit"" is distance. The more complicated a transaction, the higher the gas limit.
Gas limits boil down to the computation required by a particular action. There is a range based on the specific parameters within that transaction, but gas limits are roughly stable. Expect no more than 2x variation.
The full gas cost of an Ethereum transaction is: Gas Price * Gas Limit.
Gas price is typically denominated in ""gwei"". One gwei = 0.000000001 ETH.
If you sent a transaction priced at 10 gwei and using 120 000 gas limit, this transaction would cost you: 0.000000001 * 10 * 120 000 = 0.0012 ETH.
As the user, you can increase gas price if you want your transaction to confirm faster; and you can decrease gas price, at a cost of time, if you want cheaper transactions.
You should not change the gas limit suggested by your wallet provider. Lowering that gas limit may leave insufficient gas for the computation required, and your transaction would fail.
Note that wallet providers frequently overestimate gas limit by a healthy margin, often about 50%. This is fine. Any part of the gas limit left unspent is immediately refunded to you.
--
2) ALCHEMIX GAS COSTS
Here are the gas limit costs tied with different types of Alchemix transactions.
My methodology here was to go on Etherscan, look at the smart contracts, open roughly 10 transactions of each kind, and write down the minimum and maximum gas limit values.
Alchemix alUSD vault
Approve: 49k
Deposit: 59k - 129k
Mint: 101k
Liquidate: 159k - 229k
Withdrawal: 59k - 99k
SWAPS
Swap alUSD to stables on Curve
Approve: 49k
Exchange: 268k
Swap alUSD to crypto on Zapper, Metamask, Sushiswap
Approve: 49k
Swap: 104k - 134k
FARMS
ALCX/ETH SLP
Approve: 47k
Deposit: 114k - 179k
Withdraw: 95k - 142k
Harvest: 138k - 189k
Withdraw and Harvest: 116k - 162k
Other Farms
Approve: 47k
Claim: 80k - 97k
Deposit: 82k - 128k
Exit: 74k - 128k
Withdraw: 103k - 116k
(Note: ""Withdraw"" and ""Exit"" seem to be identical functions in the farm contract.)
--
3) PUTTING IT TOGETHER
To work out how much it would cost you to use Alchemix, consider your loan flow. What do you want to do with the money you're going to borrow? Farm it for ALCX rewards? Convert it to USDC and cash out to buy a boat? Depending on your goal, you can add up the required actions from the above list.
For example, let's say I want to take out an Alchemix loan, mint alUSD, swap it to ALCX, and farm the single-sided ALCX farm.
My actions would be: (alUSD vault) approve, deposit, mint, (sushiswap) approve, swap, (farm) approve, deposit.
For a complete gas limit cost of, assuming the maximum number in each range: 49k + 129k + 101k + 49k + 134k + 47k + 128k = 637 000 gas limit.
If I wait for quiet hours, I should be able to get those transactions in with a gas price of 10 gwei. Which would give us: 637 000 * 10 gwei = 0.00637 ETH, roughly $15 at current prices (1 ETH = ~$2350).
There's websites to help you with gas costs. ETH Gas Station offers a convenient calculator: https://ethgasstation.info/calculatorTxV.php

4) CONCLUSION
The last piece of the puzzle would be to consider your gas costs in relation to your principal, as well as the speed of the Alchemix loan repayment.
If you were to put $150 in Alchemix, the above example would cost you 10% of your principal in gas costs. With a 12% return per year on the DAI vault, it would take you almost a year just to make up for gas costs. And that return is variable, so there is no guarantee.
In my opinion, you want to play with at least a thousand dollars, for gas costs not to hurt your bottom line. That figure can perhaps be halved, if you're savvy and manage to stuff your transactions at very low gas prices. Either way, you now have some data to make your own informed decision.

It has been two weeks since the relaunch of alETH and the system is stable in its operation. No anomalies have been spotted since the contracts have gone live and the saddle alETH market is liquid and healthy.
With this in mind, the Alchemix team believes that it is time to raise the cap on alETH and that an increase in the cap from 2000 alETH to 3000 alETH is a prudent measure. The Alchemix team also asks for the discretion to increase the cap again by another 1000 alETH if we hit the limit and the system looks healthy.
As a part of the original alETH launch plan, we were also going to phase out the alUSD-only pool. Over the past month, new markets for alUSD have emerged on Sushi, Saddle, and mStable. It has also become a collateral and borrowable asset on Ruler. We have further integrations planned for alUSD after we have our price feed made by Chainlink. Therefore, we feel confident in its ability to maintain the peg without this rewards pool. The 0.5% of weekly rewards will be redistributed to the alETH LP pool, with the distribution being:
58% ETH/ALCX SLP
18% ALCX only
18% alUSD3CRV LP
6% alETH/ETH LP
The alUSD-only pool would remain indefinitely, but the ALCX rewards would be reduced to zero.
A ""for"" vote authorizes the following:
-increase the alETH debt cap by 1000 alETH
-give the Alchemix team discretion to raise it another 1000 alETH 
-adjust farming weights to end the alUSD-only pool and give its allocation to the alETH-LP pool.
A vote ""against"" rejects this proposal."

['ALCX Rewards Idea - Liquidity Mining Incentives'],"Has there ever been discussion around providing ALCX liquidity incentives that reward those who deposit Dai (and soon to be ETH) into the protocol itself? It's important for the long-term sustainability of the protocol to continue growing its deposit base, and a way to continue bootstrapping it is to provide rewards for those who deposit. It's a cost effective UA strategy to bring even more users to the protocol while also boosting earned Yearn affiliate fees as deposits grow.
I also think rewards will temporarily offset the yield compression we've seen these past few weeks. This is more of a short-term benefit and therefore less important in my opinion. But a nice added benefit nonetheless."
['ALCX Rewards Idea - Liquidity Mining Incentives'],"I understand the argumentation behind this, but I don't believe the current vaults need incentivization. Every time the debt limit is increased for the alUSD vault it's usually gone within days; the debt limit for the original alETH vault was reached in like 3 hours. So right now incentivization of the vaults makes little sense because we don't have a demand issue, but rather a supply issue (if you will).
Incentivization of the vaults might help to distribute ALCX to a wider range of users, but I'm not sure if that is a priority  at the current stage of the protocol. Might be a good thing to implement this idea at a more mature stage though (as Aave for example did). "

['Product Idea'],"Self-repaying loans paid down with LP token earnings / farming yield. This would diversify Alchemix's interest rate risk exposure by providing loans that leverage a different paydown mechanism, earned LP fees / farming rewards. I'm not a dev but I assume there would be quite a lot of complexities compared to the current Dai and ETH offerings.
To start, the protocol could use its ALCX/ETH reward pool, which could drive a nice flywheel effect to bootstrap the product concept. People see the current yield of 100% and want to participate. Demand goes up for ALCX because people are buying ALCX to LP against their ETH. They post their LP as collateral and take out alLP which is paid down with the ALCX rewards that are benefitting from rising demand for ALCX to LP. If the collateralization ratio alLP was something like 5:1, those loans would be paid down pretty quickly and potentially continue a virtuous cycle.
This all might be a crazy idea but wanted to share."

['Hybrid pool idea'],"Okay so as I said in the Discord I will copy my message here to get the discussion going. I personally like the idea and effort you put into this. I don't really have the background to discuss the feasibility or the dev work required for this - it sounds complex and will probably require a significant time investment. Plus there area clearly the risks you flagged as well. The more complex this flow becomes the higher the change of error or a possible exploit.
The bigger problem I see is that someone would probably need to create a new LP protocol that's independent of any of the existing projects, since as far as I'm aware this functionality to divert part of the LP pool doesn't exist anywhere. That also raises the question: why havent existing protocols explored this hybrid setup? Could be that they haven't thought of it, or it could be that there are technical/economic reasons for not doing so.
So I think there's really two questions for this topic: 1) is this hybrid pool setup interesting in general - at least to explore the concept? (clear yes to me) and 2) is it interesting for Alchemix specifically? (yes potentially to me). "
['Hybrid pool idea'],"0xFelix Balancer does something similar to this concept with leaving assets in yield bearing protocols whilst the  LP tokens aren't needed. the key difference here is that it doesn't have the rebalancing mechanism and the 0 slippage for certain ranges.
in terms of the dev work it's going to be a fork of saddle or uniswap V2 haven't decided which yet (I spoke to one of the saddle devs who says it's fine). the concept of how this will all works exists out there in ethereum i'm just trying to put it all together into a nice neat package. But yes i could just end up having to abandon the project due to the scale of it which would be a shame."
['[AIP-14] Saddle d4 ALCX Reward Allocation'],"Recently, saddle.finance launched the d4 stable pool, which consists of alUSD, LUSD, FRAX, and FEI. Each of our teams have been in talks about this pool and all four protocols are agreeing to supply their governance tokens to incentivise liquidity for this pool.
Each protocol has differing emissions schedules for their tokens, so to make it fair for each protocol, we have all agreed to match the rough dollar amount of the tokens at the present time and use that budget to incentivise the pool for one year. This value is looking to be around $1.1m from each protocol. For ALCX that would equate to 3,300 tokens for the entire year. To put that in perspective, we currently emit 2800 ALCX a week to incentivise the alUSD3CRV pool. This would be just over a week's worth of emissions from our farm to incentivise a farm that also receives tokens of similar value from other projects as well. It isn't a whole lot in the grand scheme of things. Since each protocol is contributing equally, we all end up having a reduced cost for liquidity.
LP's will stake the d4-LP tokens using a staking contract created by the FRAX team, which allows for multiple reward tokens. This staking contract has some nice extra features. The coolest being the ability to lock your tokens for up to one year in order to boost your rewards in the pool. So long term stakers can maximize their rewards being in this pool the longer they lock up their tokens.
Each of the tokens in this pool have strong pegging mechanisms on their own, but when combined with all 4 protocols, each system can lend its strength to the pool to help stabilize it. alUSD has the Transmuter, which is a deep backstop to the peg, LUSD can be redeemed for the underlying ETH, FRAX has an AMO module that has an algorithmic supply that can deposit and withdraw FRAX from the pool to stabilize it, and FEI has a massive backstop with their PCV module. Individually, each protocol is robust, and when combined in the d4 pool, it will stabilize our assets even further. It will also drive volume to other pools with alUSD because there will be more arbitrage opportunities (and this is good for LPs).
In order to supply these tokens, the DAO would supply tokens from its treasury at first, and then via the farming contract, have it repay the ALCX back to the treasury -- which is the same thing we do in the Sushi Onsen and Curve farms. By the end of the reward period, the DAO will have been repaid via inflationary rewards.
I am asking the DAO to authorize 4000 ALCX for this pool. A little extra is added as a buffer in case of any price deviations our respective tokens have in the coming days before the launch of this pool. Any unused tokens will be returned to the treasury.
A vote ""For"" authorizes us to incentivise the pool
A vote ""Against"" rejects this proposal"
['[AIP-14] Saddle d4 ALCX Reward Allocation'],For
['[AIP-14] Saddle d4 ALCX Reward Allocation'],"While I fully support the creation of this pool plus the incentivization - especially to move away from all the tether-backed pools - I think we also need to address the risks of the underlying assets of this D4 pool.
Personally, I feel very comfortable with LUSD and alUSD since they have performed well in both boom and bust periods. FRAX I'm less familiar with, but it seems it held its peg during the last major selloff (as the only algo stablecoin?), and what I've heard from the protocol/devs does inspire confidence.
FEI to me is a bit of a different story. I'll be fully honest by saying that I've not delved too deeply into all the details, but from what I've read and from what I can see on the charts, it performed terribly during the last market turmoil and it took a while for it to return to peg. From the discussion in our Discord server I think I'm not the only one with some reservations about FEI in this pool (starts here: https://discord.com/channels/738480789464940634/826152864837140492/858863560951988264)
One additional element is that while ALCX/LQTY/FXS clearly provide (or will provide) utility as a token, TRIBE seems to fall more into the category of valueless governance tokens. So also in terms of incentivization, FEI/TRIBE is the least interesting asset of the four.
Now that all being said, I just want to stress I'm not against the creation of this pool (in fact, I fully support it). I just think we need to highlight to the community that LP'ing this pool is not without risks. If there's more market turbulence to come it's entirely possible that FEI will lose its peg again, and LPers will end up footing the bill. I'm sure the FEI team has considered their past performance and hopefully put in place some countermeasures but their past performance is something to consider for everyone looking to join this pool. "
['[AIP-14] Saddle d4 ALCX Reward Allocation'],"0xFelix
100 % agreed with felix.  Great post to highlight that LPing for this pool has exposure to FEI which had its share of problems. I've heard people talking about changes they made but have 0 ideas about the efficacy.
That said, even if FEI (or any of the other coins in the pool)  were to fail at peg maintenance... it really only affects the LPs. There will be plenty of LPs with high enough risk tolerance  and you shouldn't if you personally aren't comfortable with the exposure.
Big picture-wise, it seems like a great play.  For the 4 projects (+saddle) it increases visibility, reduces depegging risk and encourages collaboration with eachother. There is a ton of room in the stable coin market and competition with USDT is healthy for crypto as a whole.
Any one project failing would be sad, but wouldn't be a huge impact to the survivors.
If the pool and projects are successful there could be the potential of treasury swaps or  acceptance as use of collateral in the mid-distant future
Anyway, I'm for the pool obviously and will probably LP too.  There's not much downside if you're not planning on LPing and the upside is substantial.

We could have a D3 (sort of like the 3-pool) and then add a D4 later.  This seems to have lots of inertia behind it and will be pushed through quickly.  I hope we don't regret that.

Y"
['[AIP-14] Saddle d4 ALCX Reward Allocation'],"As someone who was heavily invested with FEI and deeply involved in all the discussions in their discord and discourse post-launch, I can say that the concerns about FEI today are based on a lack of knowledge about how and why FEI lost its peg.  The main issues for FEI's launch were that: (1) as part of their initial sale, they awarded anyone who exchanged ETH for FEI with a proportionate share of airdropped TRIBE and (2) their original (now replaced) mechanism for keeping the peg involved something called ""direct incentives"" in their pool, which penalized folks for selling FEI the further it was from the peg.
First, because of the airdrop, the FEI launch was oversubscribed because many folks saw it as a low-risk way of getting a free airdrop (send eth, get equivalent amount of a stablecoin named FEI, get airdropped a proportionate share of TRIBE, sell your FEI back to ETH, profit).  Problem was that everyone had the same plan so, immediately after launch, when everyone tried to sell their FEI back to ETH, the FEI price began to drop below the peg.  Here's where the second issue arose.  Because of the ""direct incentives"" mechanism, if you tried to sell FEI when it was below $1, the pool would automatically penalize you based on how far away from the peg you were selling.  If it was 1% away from the peg, it would penalize you 2% when you sold; if it was 2%, the penalty would be 4%; 3% = penalty of 9%; and 5% off from peg would equal a penalty of 25%.  Obviously if you sold when it was 10% off the peg, you'd lose 100%.
Because of the extreme demand to sell FEI back to ETH, people were willing to pay some penalty (but not a 100% penalty) so the price of FEI was continually between $.93 and $.97.  This was unsustainable for a stablecoin intending to be pegged at $1.  Through a series of governance proposals, the issues were resolved.  First, the direct incentives mechanism was removed, which was artificially keeping the price above $.90.  This dropped the price of FEI into the $.70s and $.80s as people were able to sell out if they really wanted to.  Next, they instituted a mechanism to use the protocol controlled ETH (which was a huge war chest at this point based on the oversubscribed launch) to buy back FEI @ $.95 from anyone who wanted to sell at $.95.  Just announcing this moved the price back up to $.95 because of arbitrageurs.  Then they slowly moved this target closer and closer to $1 through a regularly repeating (every 4 hours?) pool rebalancing mechanism.
All in all, at this stage, FEI is a very stable stablecoin project.  Its risk is that it's collateralized with ETH so if there's a huge crash in the price of ETH, it could theoretically become undercollateralized but it's sitting on over $500 million in protocol controlled value and this represents a 300% collateralization ratio so, in my opinion, it's in a very healthy spot.  With its current peg mechanisms and its PCV, I would have no concerns about it being included in this pool."

['Partnership with mStable and co-incentivization of an alUSD/mUSD Pool'],"Hello, I am dimsome from mStable and I would like to formally propose a partnership with mStable and I would like to ask you, the community, for your interest.
Background
At mStable, we initiated a governance vote to add alUSD into a Feeder Pool. This pool would not just provide swaps from and to alUSD and mUSD, but also provide a way to efficiently swap into SAVE and earn interest on stable coins directly from the Alchemix ecosystem. The vote will end this Friday, 2nd July. Here is the link to (Snapshot)[https://snapshot.org/#/mstable/proposal/QmckdX8K245EU6CZz4XVyMAGW7bTf3T7kQ2n8zUcnsisN6].
What is a Feeder Pool?
Feeder Pools are essentially pools providing swaps and plug into the wider part of mStable. Feeder Pools provide an efficient way to swap assets that trade around the same price. Unlike other swaps, a Feeder Pool plugs into the wider mStable protocol, hence the name Feeder Pool, because it Feeds into the mStable ecosystem. Holders could easily swap their alUSD to any other stablecoin available on mStable or swap and earn an interest rate in the mStable SAVE. Users can also provide liquidity to the pool and earn a dynamically allocated amount of MTA tokens and swap fees for doing so.
How will this benefit Alchemix?
Alchemix alUSD is a money lego that is unlike any other! Adding an alUSD/mUSD Feeder will benefit Alchemix in the following ways:
Adds an additional use case for alUSD in the Feeder Pool for earning swap fees.
Provide Efficient swaps with low free from and into alUSD.
Gives users the ability to use alUSD and directly deposit into SAVE. Essentially earning interest on the interest of the self-repaying loan.
Diversifies trading of alUSD to other protocols, less concentration on a few dominating protocols dictating the market.
What will the future bring?
This Feeder Pool is just the beginning, and we hope that a mutually beneficial regenerative cycle can be established that brings both protocols and their use-case closer together over time. mStable has a clean track record of fantastic collaborations in the past, and we hope the Alchemix community wishes to see this thing come together in a smooth and professional way
We are also currently exploring a new mStable Asset: mETH. The assets that are included in this basket are still up for discussion. alETH is definitely a strong contester.
The mStableDAO has also expressed interest in utilizing the Alchemix contracts in the future once contract interaction with the protocol has been enabled, and would love to further collaborate around other possible DAO<>DAO interactions in the future if a similar interest is seen on the side of Alchemix.
The proposed partnership
In order to bootstrap liquidity, we would like to ask the community to weigh in about co-incentivization for the Feeder Pool. mStable will allocate around 20k-60k (dependent on swap volume and TVL of the pool) of MTA rewards per week. We would like to ask Alchemix to match this amount for a period of 3 months, with an option to re-evaluate the proposed partnership at this stage. At current prices, that would be around 50-100 ALCX per week.
In closing
We would love to establish more collaboration with Alchemix and we can start by co-incentivizing an alUSD/mUSD Feeder Pool. This can be a start of a beautiful friendship and more products are coming in the future that can be closely integrated benefitting both protocols.
What are your thoughts? Let's discuss and I am happy to decide this in an ALCX Snapshot vote."

['AIP - 13 alUSD Cap Increases'],"Despite several weeks of turbulent markets and a sharp reduction in the alUSD reward weight, the alUSD peg has held incredibly well. It is clear that there is the demand to raise the cap and to give the people what they want, more alUSD.
The team is confident we can handle a large increase to the debt ceiling, however, we don't want to do it all at once. Therefore, for AIP 13, we propose that we have the clearance to raise the debt ceiling from 125m to 200m over the course of three steps. Initially, we will raise it from 125 to 150m. We will raise it to 175, and again to 200 if the peg is stable and market conditions permit.
Approving this governance action will allow the team to conduct three debt cap raises up to 200m alUSD. The core team will proceed with the utmost caution upon each successive debt cap raise and will prioritize the peg and system stability over anything else.
Rejecting this governance action indicates that you are in favor of an alternative proposal and or reject this proposal.

['AIP - 13 alUSD Cap Increases'],"Thelionshire
The metrics would be the actual peg, the balance of alusd in the various pools, and the trajectory of the transmuter's balance. If those all look healthy, then we will proceed with the next raise. We certainly won't have as long as a wait as we currently have had. Albeit part of why the delay happened was that we were being sidetracked with the aftermath of the alETH incident.
Only wanted authorization to do this so we can remove some friction for a little while."
['AIP - 13 alUSD Cap Increases'],"Definitely in favor.  The primary reason anyone would use the protocol is to get a loan without taking on the liquidation risk.  When we are up against the debt ceiling, the protocol cannot fulfill its primary use case.   Do we foresee a time when the debt ceiling can be removed entirely?  Personally, I don't understand why alUSD would be subject to losing it's peg when it is backed 2-1 by DAI.  If the peg did slip users could deposit to the transducer to arbitrage.  If they acquired alUSD via loan, they can return it and get their collateral back.   Users with DAI collateral and no alUSD could buy it at a discount and pay back their loans.  Seems like market dynamics would quickly take care of any peg issues that may arise."
['AIP - 13 alUSD Cap Increases'],"asymrisk Consider the scenario where alUSD starts losing peg. Say you put in 4k and took out a loan for 2k, and were lucky and sold your alUSD for DAI before peg start slipping. So now you say ""hey, I'll arb it back up, pay my debt for cheap!"". Well, your debt has been automatically paid down some amount by the system, let's say $100,  so you no longer need to buy 2k alUSD - just $1900. Other users are in similar scenarios, or they still have alUSD and therefore have more alUSD than debt - so even they need to sell alUSD. So enter the transmuter - great! Except the transmuter takes time to repay, and that kinda sucks. If we ever enter a situation where people truly have to ""wait"" for their alUSD to be worth $1, then that should be an actual emergency. Not because we increased the cap too fast.

['Discussion: What is the best way to give ALCX more utility?'],"In recent weeks, the idea of adding utility to the ALCX governance token has been a hot topic. I would like to start a conversation here so that we can share ideas on the best way to do this, and potentially put forth an AIP vote on the subject.
To summarize the conversation happening on the DIscord currently, incentivizing people to hold ALCX could be achieved by throttling the yield of users not holding ALCX. There could be a smooth yield curve to a ceiling based on how many ALCX you have. I.e. the first ALCX gets you the largest increment of benefit, the second less so.
Example:
At a given time the DAI APY is 15%
No-coiners receive 12%
-ALCX hodlers get a rate somewhere between 12% and 15% based on holdings
-Extra 3% is returned to ALCX holders in some way? Maybe an APY higher than 15%??
-End result, holding ALCX will result in the highest stablecoin return rate on the market
Looking forward to this discussion with you guys, please comment how we can make this idea better or even brand new ideas for how we can add utility and value to the ALCX token.
Happy Yunting 🙂"
['Discussion: What is the best way to give ALCX more utility?'],One way to pass on value to ALCX holders would be to periodically take some of the revenue earned from each vault and buy ALCX from the corresponding 2 pool and burn it.

['Discussion: What is the best way to give ALCX more utility?'],"I agree that the token needs to add utility however holding the token for a boosted apy is no different from increasing x points the protocol fee and distribute that to alcx stakers but with another layer of friction for users who want to use the protocol.
What we need for the protocol to succeed long term is to have as much TVL as possible and I don’t think this helps on that front. It’s like having your sales drop and increase the price to match it. I get the price has dumped significantly and I find it awesome that we are looking at creative ways to stop the bleeding but I would not touch the user side of it"
['Discussion: What is the best way to give ALCX more utility?'],"I think there are two overlapping ideas people are interested in here, the first is ways to help ALCX number go up (and reduce later sell pressure). The second is ways to bring more utility between holding ALCX at the protocol. Implemented well, both will help the price go up and reduce sell pressure.
The utility proposition for v2 is revenue and voting. The risk will be the possibility of getting slashed to cover unforeseen protocol losses.
Ideas such as buybacks/burns as well as emissions rebalancing aim to increase the token value, but they don't bring additional utility to the token.
I am interested to hear the increased APY and other propositions for additional token utility. In addition to the increased APY on loan repayment for ALCX holders, a similar idea that was mentioned was having the ability to borrow more alAsset (lower collateral ratio, for example down to 180% instead of 200% for alusd). One added benefit to this could be that it would require one to LOCK their ALCX for the duration of the loan (I think this would be necessary, otherwise you could hold ALCX, borrow at the lower c-ratio, and then sell the ALCX). And since some people will have their loans for an extended period of time, this might offer a way to start locking up decent chunks of ALCX.

I don't think that this is tenable. It's important that people not be able to borrow more than they have deposited in collateral.
sum 0.5n for n=1..infinity is 1. So allowing anything greater than 0.5 LTV would allow for people to recursively borrow and get more than they originally deposited. This is will create a feedback loop that will cause the alXXX assets to lose value relative their paired assets in the liquidity pools. Everybody would be able to eventually get their assets back because of the transumter, but a lot of the value of the protocol is lost if there is no liquidity for the alXXX tokens."

Gravity Appreciate this perspective. I could see why TLM is an important metric for a project's success, especially for the POV of larger holders. Is there a TLM threshold that tends to open up the token to these larger accounts? 
If providing liquidity is one of the keys to long term growth of a project, then how do we incentivize providing liquidity and then not dumping as a way to take profits? It seems to me that additional token utility could be one way attract and keep liquidity.
For what it's worth, anecdotally, I have recently changed from swapping my alcx rewards to more SLP to now just staking in the ALCX pool. Reasons being the low alcx:eth exchange, and the comparable APR. Thus I'm not selling alcx, but not increasing liquidity. Obviously just 1 tiny tiny skrimp..."

We do not know if this is the tipping point for this change in mental models, but we can share that our observations show those accounts with $5M USD or greater focus far more on TLM (Total Liquid Market) vs. TVL (Total Value Locked)... to elaborate; TVL has proven time and time again to grab the attention of many, but participation (especially of larger accounts) only occurs when the TLM meets or exceeds a threshold that is set by their own risk tolerance/profile. This is to say where the risk of being 'trapped' in an asset is greatly diminished due to the size of its market. Thus. In our opinion, the most effective way of achieving 'number go up' is to greatly expand the total liquid market... and to do this, the most effective approach is to stake in the SLP. "

In our opinion, while the project matures, it would be wiser to protect the team from distraction or directional changes signalled by the community at this time. This isn't to say the voice of the community isn't valuable or undesirable, rather, we simply feel the community (ourselves included) is still young in its understanding of the tools being created.

Until these use cases mature, we feel these conversations should happen, but they should be kept within the community and not be put to a snapshot vote.

In regards to single stake vs. SLP, we prefer SLP, especially at this time. 
We are not ashamed to say that our primary goal is more ETH, if you resonate with this idea, then the lower ALCX goes against ETH, the greater the risk profile swings in your favour to gain ETH as the tide changes.

['Discussion: What is the best way to give ALCX more utility?'],"The way I see it, adding value to the token makes sense, but that idea is already planned afaik (treasury yield going to alcx staker with alcx staker being slashed if an issue arrise). Main issue at this moment is that the price is bleeding, and instead of seeing it as an opportunity to accumulate, we want to stop the bleeding. Maybe even at the expense of some of the protocol legitimacy by adding rules so that to enjoy maximum yield, you need to buy alcx tokens. Not a bad idea in itself, but changing the rules to the game midway when there's already 500m DAI locked up feels weird (imho)
I think the bigger picture to take into account is that should this be successful and manage to lock up a good chunk of TVL, along with the release of income-stream generating ALCX staking, and as the space matures, its not totally unexpected of the ALCX token to go back to its original price. That will take time though, and careful planning of debt ceilings being raised chunks by chunks.
Let's say in 2025 the alETH debt ceiling is 200k, collateral ratio 200%, so 400k eth is locked up. Eth is worth 10k at that point in time (which is total FUD imo but lets say its 10k only, about 2.5x current ATH). There's 4b$ worth of eth generating yield, at probably higher APYs than now (due to Yearn now having the possibility to use staking strategies, as eth 2.0 has been delivered). There might be 5b dai generating yield, for a 2.5b alUSD ceiling. And there might be 100k BTC generating yield for 50k alBTC, lets say BTC is worth 100k at that point. That's another 10b$ generating yield. There might be an USDC vault, similar to DAI, worth 3b, or a USDT vault, a link vault, whatever else there is, adding on more yield generated.
If in total the TVL reaches something like 50b, at lets say 10% apy across the board, and considering there might be 3m ALCX tokens in existence at that point of time (number of active ALCX tokens staking is unsure though, 3m is kind of the theoretical maximum).
50b generates 5b yearly, of which 500m goes to ALCX holders. This means every ALCX token now generates about 166$ yearly, if 100% of the existing ALCX tokens are staked to earn that return.
I dont think 50b is far fetched for the future of this protocol, although for that to happen, the focus needs to remain clear on the original vision and not short terms shenanigans to stop temporary bleeding (that would happen anyway, everything is bleeding atm, its not ALCX alone)
At current numbers (500m dai locked up, 8k eth locked up) and current price (eth 2k for the sake of this exercise), with about 800k ALCX circulating, each token would generate 7$ yearly. So I think the focus right now should be on how to increase the TVL (and as Gravity mentioned, the liquidities so whales never feel trapped by being part of the protocol), rather than how to stop the price from bleeding.
In current crab/bear market, the price will bleed, even if you ask everyone with an alUSD loan to stake 1x alcx token (or 10 even, but that that point most people would just pull out and go invest their 10-50k DAI somewhere that doesn't require them to buy 4k worth of tokens). I don't see it even making a dent on the current bleeding, and with current emissions. How many people can there be in a vault with 500m DAI? 2000? 5000? Maybe 10000 unique users? Let's say there is 100 000 unique users and they need a token to enjoy higher yield. That might stabilize the price for about 5 weeks (if and only if they all buy one, press X to doubt), and if the general market is still bleeding then we resume bleeding at that point.
It all feels like temporary bandaids at the cost of protocol legitimacy by changing rules midway and displaying a lack of faith in the original vision (which can and should be tweaked for the good reasons, but I dont feel like ""alcx price go down because market go down"" is one)."

I would advocate for keeping the mental model for the most basic user interaction -- depositing assets to a vault to borrow against -- as simple and understandable as possible. Too much complexity here could limit adoption/TVL.
Positioning ALCX ownership/staking as an opportunity to boost or enhance one's Alchemix experience feels like a better story to tell than ALCX ownership/staking being a requirement for the full Alchemix experience. Holding ALCX should generate a true benefit, not the absence of a penalty.

"
['[ARC-2] (governance) Parameterization of Protocol Dynamics and Debt Ratio'],"This post is an open request for discussion on the viewpoint that certain key parameters in Alchemix be made configurable within a larger range and ultimately handed over to governance.
TLDR;
alAssets are trustless promissory notes and with sufficient liquidity, Alchemix can safely issue alAssets near a 1.0 debt / asset ratio.  Pursuing this unlocks improved yields, new product offerings, and competitive advantages which support Alchemix's growth and defensibility as a top DeFi protocol.
Impetus
Alchemix's key innovation is providing loans with:
No interest
No liquidation risk
Up to 2x leverage
This is achieved by making the user both the borrower and lender on a loan.  Upon exiting the system, any leverage collapses to 1 and the outstanding debt is reconciled either by burning the alAsset or repaying in equivalent base assets.
Much of the current discussion in the community focuses on the ""collaterialization ratio"" of the base asset(s) to the synthetic alAsset.  This language, adopted from cross-collateralized lending or synthetic asset protocols, implies greater fragility in the system and a threat of liquidation which does not exist in Alchemix.
An alternative framing is to think of Alchemix as a (De)-Central bank issuing debt.
In Alchemix v1, users deposit their collateral into a loss-free, ""number-go-up"" investment strategy.  Since this collateral is locked in the system, alAssets can be safely issued as debt without the risk of double spending.  Unlike sUSD, DAI, lUSD or other over-collateralized stablecoins, alUSD functions like an on-chain promissory note.  Each alUSD offers a smart-contract ensured claim to an underlying stablecoin.  As such the risk of alUSD short-term losing value is a macro-economic liquidity risk.  Long-term value loss is a smart contract risk.
Viewed this way, a measure of the stability of the protocol would be the debt / asset ratio of the entire Alchemix system.  Careful management of this ratio and existing liquidity can improve Alchemix's defensibility and value prop relative to other single-asset yield protocols.  (A debt ratio of 0.5 is already how the protocol lets users earn 1.5x yield from yvDai on 1x DAI).
In Tradfi, financial institutions routinely have high debt ratios even when they issue unsecured, cross-asset, interest bearing loans.  Alchemix only offers asset backed, zero interest promissory notes.  In Defi, Alchemix can offer even stronger guarantees of solvency since the exact debt issuance and business logic of the protocol are public and easily auditable on the blockchain.
(Pre) Proposal to allow configuration of debt ratio, debt issuance, and debt yield fee (eventually by governance)
Below is a governance proposal which is a prerequisite to utilizing excess debt to boost yields for users, increase protocol revenue, etc. while aiming to adhere to existing user expectations of the protocol.  I respect the trust alUSD has carefully built and in general favor moving slowly.  This proposal focuses on allowing for more aggressive debt issuance when future liquidity and project maturity warrant it.  Actual protocol dynamics and outstanding debt would not change without later action.
Variable Definitions
Debt Issuance Ratio - Amount of debt which can be withdrawn by the depositor.
current = 50%
Debt / Asset Ratio - The ratio of outstanding alAsset to underlying backing collateral.
current = min(debtCeiling / totalAssets, 50%).
""Protocol owned debt"" yield fee percentage - Fee to be taken from income on debt issued to the protocol out of the difference between the allowable debt and the debt issuance.
Option to eliminate the 10% yearn earnings fee to make it more obvious that users are strictly better to invest in alchemix vs. the underlying investment vault (eg. yvDai) even without transmuter boosts or extra alUSD to yvDai transactions.
Proposed Protocol Changes.
All governance parameters below would be applied separately for each alAsset.  (eg. alUSD and alEth would have distinct debt ratios)
Alchemix should allow configuration (and eventually governance control) of the debt to asset ratio within the band of 0.5 and 1.0.
Alchemix should allow configuration (and eventually governance control) of the debt issuance ratio between 0 and 100%.
Alchemix should allow configuration (and eventually governance control) of the protocol-owned debt yield fee percentage between 0 and 100%.
Excess debt minted against locked collateral should be managed by the protocol and used to incentivize locked value (yield boost), increase protocol income, and secure the integrity of the alAsset peg depending on competition and market conditions.  Protocol debt would also need to be dynamically burned / minted to respond to governance or tlv changes. This relative increase in available alAssets can also be supported without losing the peg by offering a more real-time up-pegging mechanism than the transmuter.
^ Specific ratios and debt utilization strategies can be discussed on an actual, separate AIP.  However, I think there are good reasons for no more than .65,50%,0-20% to start.  Risk adverse DAO members could even vote to maintain current protocol economics utilizing this proposal (0.5,50%,0).
Requested Action
This write-up is a meant as an initial argument for a major change to the protocol dynamics.  I believe these changes will help stave off competitors offering higher leverage while maintaining Alchemix's heart and core value props.
I would welcome disagreement, discussion, feedback, and love to hear of any blindspots or holes in this line of thinking.
Future Discussions
Depending on feedback to this discussion, separate discussions and AIPs could be started to:
Add a configurable 50% debt ratio for alUSD in addition to the debt ceiling  (after v2?). (improved UX, take the brakes off alUSD growth).  Once liquidity stabilizes on v2, ceiling can be used as a fallback with less onerous management happening through the ratio.
Time-locked Alchemix deposits with boosted yield from protocol minted debt.  (growth/defensibility)  Assuming debt issued against time-locked deposits could be kept less liquid.
Alternative pegging mechanisms.
I expect peg-loss and lack of confidence in alAssets will be one of the main concerns with this discussion.  I believe these could be addressed even at higher debt ratios but would likely warrant deeper conversations.  Some options for example:
(near)-direct alAsset exchange from collateral or yield pool for guaranteed immediate exit.
Governance manipulation of the debt ratio (burn / mint protocol-owned alAssets).
Continued reliance on the transmuter but with a larger buffer.
Internal AMM amongst backing assets. (eg. stablecoin pool for alUSD).
novel ideas
"
['[ARC-2] (governance) Parameterization of Protocol Dynamics and Debt Ratio'],"Nice write up, if I understood correctly basically you are proposing to invest the excess liquidity derived from overcollateralized assets that don´t have liquidation requirements. The excess liquidity is already used to boost the repayment if I´m not wrong so I presume you want to mint alusd against that excess collateral increasing the debt ratio in order to give an additional push to the yield for borrowers and gain on the protocol fee.
In that case, as you well guessed my concern is about keeping the peg, since most yield generating instruments are denominated in other stablecoins, how do you ensure we would have dai in the transmuter to keep the peg in line once there is no excess collateral from which to swap from?
It´s a different story if there were yield generating opportunities for alusd itself (separate from those subsidized by the protocol) as it happened for dai (but maker did not mint) that it was consistently over the peg since there was a degen yield harvesting mania.
I like the concept although i find it hard at this stage for alusd to keep the peg with additional backed protocol minting, perhaps it´s enough with the curve pool but I´d wait till alusd has more value prop alternatives than the current ones.
Anyhow I do think we should look for ways to tap into this excess liquidity at a certain moment in time if it´s feasible in baby steps. "
['[ARC-2] (governance) Parameterization of Protocol Dynamics and Debt Ratio'],"@mario1986  Appreciate your thoughts above and agree with your ""not now"" conclusion and comments on alUSD use cases being too immature.  With the alEth hiccup and the iron.finance stablecoin debacle (although totally different 🙂), it's definitely worth letting things settle down.  Plus, the WIP v2 efforts are definitely worth prioritizing over chasing yield.
I was thinking about this question.
how do you ensure we would have dai in the transmuter to keep the peg in line once there is no excess collateral from which to swap from?
I put more specific numbers below to clarify what I was thinking; but, I was still only imagining issuing 50% alUSD to the user.  So the excess debt wouldn't have to be redeemable for transmuter DAI or impact user redemption at all.  However, I agree this ""empty transmuter"" vulnerability would be exacerbated by circulating more alUSD.
More specifically, I was thinking of use cases like:
Create a private alUSD ""vault"" strategy which is only utilized by the protocol.
Mint extra alUSD up to the debt ratio and stick it in the private vault to yield boost DAI deposits.
Imagining conservative numbers - user debt issuance of 0.5, protocol debt ratio of 0.8, and internal alUSD yield of 8%:
This would issue alUSD against 30% more of the DAI and net a 5% extra yield against user debt for the protocol to allocate as it wished.
Since, each alUSD is still overcollateralized and redeemable this seems like sufficient incentive to maintain the peg (once the transmuter is made more real-time with a larger buffer).
This could be a stronger guarantee if debt was only issued against users who time-locked their deposits (for more of the yield boost)
Seems best the alUSD vault could do now would be:
price stable/high
issue debt, put in convex pool - suck up liquidity mining incentives, ALCX ""buy-back"", CRV / CVX ""dump or diversify""
issue debt, put in yvALUSDCrv - suck up stablecoin yield from swaps, dumping liquidity mining incentives
price low
bring protocol debt in and burn it and rely on normal mechanisms to stabilize

On the ""empty transmuter"" and weakening up-pegging mechanisms
Question - I'd be curious to look at how much under-pegged alUSD is maintained by discounted paying of debts vs. the transmuter which is more of a last resort.
Safer answer -  Pull in protocol owned debt and burn.  If things are dire but price-stable, can swap alUSD for DAI and stick it in the transmuter as a UX quick fix.
Maybe more controversial answer? -   I haven't spoken with the devs on this but it seems to me like the yearn backed transmuter is now largely a clever accounting trick to distinguish 
A) the user redeemable DAI at liquidation
B) the outstanding alUSD issued which the liquidator didn't claim as DAI (+ net yield from yearn).  All of this is safe to redeem for alUSD since it is already reconciled in the accounting.  
** However, if it's possible to represent the entire portfolio in one single yvDAI vault + a dynamic buffer of DAI then collateral in the transmuter becomes a non-issue.  All investable DAI is essentially in the transmuter.  Redemptions can be near-instant.  If everyone wants to redeem all the alUSD issued, then the yearn vault unwinds and everyone gets their DAI back while burning their alUSD debt.
Overall, I prefer option 2 since it's a stronger guarantee for users that they can get their DAI back immediately rather than waiting for the system to unwind from liquidations and yield over an unspecified period of time. "

['Looking Ahead - Reward Allocation Suggestions'],"Hello All,
With the recent movement of the SLP Farming to Sushi's ""Yield"" page & the notoriety of being the first ""Double Yield Farm"", we are bound to pick up more deposits and thus staked SLP in the farm. As a direct result, this will dilute the returns for those staked in the ALCX/WETH SLP. It will have the benefit of strengthening the pair and reducing chance of slippage on large trades, which is great.
If we safely assume upon ending the 2x rewards that we see APR slashed around 50%, this puts SLP's APR at parity with the single-sided ALCX farm. Once the APR of the SLP drop lower than the single sided stake, investors will weigh the opportunity cost of IL more heavily than they do now. Of course many investors in the project are often bullish on ALCX and seek to preserve some exposure to ETH as well (me included), so these folks will likely stay in the SLP.
My suggestion that I'd like to put up for discussion is that we slowly re-balance the allocation of rewards between the SLP and the single-side ALCX farms over time. Perhaps something like 5% every 2 weeks until we find an equilibrium. As the protocol matures, this will help alleviate sell pressure on ALCX as well and encourage more accumulation of ALCX in anticipation of the release of the AlchemixDAO.
It could look something like this:
Current
58% ETH/ALCX SLP
18% ALCX only
18% alUSD3CRV LP
6% alETH/ETH LP
First Adjustment
53% ETH/ALCX SLP
23% ALCX only
18% alUSD3CRV LP
6% alETH/ETH LP
Second Adjustment (2 weeks)
48% ETH/ALCX SLP
28% ALCX only
18% alUSD3CRV LP
6% alETH/ETH LP
Would love to hear more thoughts on this idea!

['Looking Ahead - Reward Allocation Suggestions'],Too hypothetical and too soon to worry about this. 
['Looking Ahead - Reward Allocation Suggestions'],mistertodd I prefer to be proactive rather than reactive. DeFi is filled with too much reactivity. Do you have any meaningful thoughts about it?
['Looking Ahead - Reward Allocation Suggestions'],"If I'm understanding correctly you're suggesting we increase the allocation to the ALCX only pool? Which would increase the APY for it, at the cost of the APY in the ETH/ALCX SLP pool?
That doesn't makes sense to me as the stakers who provide liquidity and that are exposed to IL should be rewarded more than stakers in the ALCX only no?"
['Looking Ahead - Reward Allocation Suggestions'],"hellomoon This is why I said looking ahead. Over time as more people support the liquidity between ALCX/ETH, the rewards are diluted enough that the APR will not offset and IL experienced.
The longer we keep REALLY high allocation on ALCX/ETH SLP, the more longer we encourage sell pressure on ALCX. As people compound their ALCX, they are dumping 50% of it on the market. This behavior can be curbed by incentivizing hodling of ALCX through more appealing APRs.
I'm not suggesting changing it a crazy amount, but we should begin to move some allocation points towards ALCX only at some point in my opinion and gauge the affects on willingness for LP'ers to continue vs removing liquidity and going single-sided."
['Looking Ahead - Reward Allocation Suggestions'],"I'm really enjoying this thread. Sort of a different thought, but I'm starting to wonder: do we need to incentivise the SLP?
There is $254M of value locked in the Sushi farm right now. And, interestingly enough, $264M of value locked in the SLP, period. So there's $10M floating around getting no rewards, or 4% of the total value locked.
As I understand it, the role of the SLP is to offer liquidity with minimal slippage for ALCX. Incentivizing some liquidity makes sense. But perhaps we have reached a point where incentives are no longer required - or at least, where it might make sense to consider whether the current level of incentives is necessary.
Let's start with the most extreme scenario: no more rewards of any kind for ETH/ALCX. What would happen then? There is always inertia in LP behavior. That $10M of ETH/ALCX SLP earning no rewards, beyond the microscopic LP fees, gives us a hint of that.
Granted, the Sushi migration took place only one week ago. Some of the remaining LPers would likely move to the Sushi farm given enough time. Nonetheless it might be interesting to see how long that move takes.
$250M TVL is massive. The most popular pairs, involving stablecoins, BTC and/or ETH, are in that range. Most ""blue chip"" tokens from established DeFi projects like MKR, SNX, COMP... trade fine with TVL in a $20M-$40M range. So could it be possible the SLP could withstand a 90% drop in liquidity without hurting slippage significantly?
Say we reduce rewards significantly on the SLP, there's also a balancing effect in that LP trading fees start to become meaningful. Right now, LP fees amount to about 3-4%. If we witnessed a 90% drop in liquidity while volume kept the same, remaining LPs could expect 30-40% from fees alone. And that is money earned from traders rather than spent by the protocol, always a plus.
I think it'd make sense to progressively decrease the share of the ETH/ALCX SLP rewards. No matter where those extra rewards go.
Now personally, I'm not sure the ALCX single stakers have any more incentive to not dump their reward tokens than the SLP owners. With either strategy, you can choose to compound for even more rewards or lock in your gains. One can be in the ETH/ALCX and not sell a single ALCX. The popularity of Pickle is proof enough of that behavior. And conservely, one can decide to buy a given amount of ALCX, stake their tokens in the farm, and consider rewards as extras to be sold.
I get that there is a 50% dump vs a 0% dump amidst those who do dump. In all honesty, I guess ultimately I'm not too interested in propping up the token price in the short term, through these mechanics. There can be a level of ponzinomics in encouraging people to compound so they can compound so they can compound... and so on.
In the long run, ALCX won't need ponzinomics, as holders will get a share of the protocol fees. So in a way, we could argue NOT incentivizing the single sided farm too much might actually help concentration of the ALCX supply into the hands of those who believe in the long-term vision of the protocol! If token price slumps somewhat until then, that's more opportunities for long-term believers to get a sizeable stake of governance.
I wonder if we might get more mileage out of rewarding the alETH/ETH pair even further. The higher the rewards there, the more incentive to directly exchange ETH for alETH. Which would lock more ETH in the Transmuter forever. Which translates to better yields. Which gives us faster loan repayments.
There is perhaps the opportunity to do something really special here. Everyone wants ETH, and everyone wants yield on their ETH. And getting good yield on your ETH is one of the hardest things to do in this space.
If we manage to get so many people to trade their ETH for alETH the Transmuter yield is boosted to 8%, 10%, 12%... Alchemix will look more and more attractive to all kinds of crypto enthusiasts.
I could see a tipping point where things snowball almost exponentially rather than linearly.
Thoughts?
"
['Looking Ahead - Reward Allocation Suggestions'],"PhiMarHal I agree there's plenty of room to reduce the SLP rewards, especially on the heels of CEX listings. I also think that the allocation to the alETH/ETH/sETH pool should be raised IF we see APR drop and liquidity their stagnate, but that should be a reactionary measure, not something we do right now. I'm skeptical that a raise to that allocation will be needed at all in the immediate future. Yields on ETH exposure are typically low in DeFi and if it's already the best you'll find it would probably would be a waste of emissions.
I'd also like to dispute your point that selling rewards is just as likely for ALCX farmers. It's entirely possible people could hedge their positions or want to be earning their yield in some other form, but it's still less likely than any of the other farms, because staking in the single-sided ALCX is taking on ALCX price risk and assumes that you're bullish on the ALCX price; and if that's the case than you're more likely to be stacking ALCX and compounding rewards than selling to something else. Consider the following to illustrate this line of thinking:
100 ALCX staked at a price of 1000 per ALCX and an APR of 100% = 100k dollars of value staked and 100k earned at the end of 1 year.
If the price goes from 1000 to 700 over the course of one month, you've now lost 30% of your initial investment over the course of that month. Even if we generously assume that the price was 1000 all the way up until the last day, 1 months worth of rewards would have netted you only (100k/12) or $8.3k earned. Which obviously pales in comparison to your $30k that you've lost on negative price action. Even if the price had fallen to only 900 in that time you would have been better off not farming ALCX at all.
So given the assumption that ALCX farmers are logically bullish on ALCX and more likely to be stacking and compounding than selling, and also given the fact that earning high APR makes holding your ALCX more appealing, I think it's safe to say that the APR on ALCX farm is probably the best driver of positive price action outside of pure speculation.
The only other place to divert those rewards would be the CRV farm. The CRV farm is generally the most important since that pool since helps maintain the peg and curb the need to use the Transmuter, however the peg as been strong and I don't believe additional liquidity is needed at the moment. It also makes the more sense logically for CRV farmers to be selling their farming rewards than farmers who are exposed to the price of ALCX for reasons discussed above.
The price of ALCX has been taking a beating, and the goal of the ALCX farm has always been curbing ALCX price pressure. Clearly the current emissions haven't done a good enough job at that. Combine that with the possibility that some of the treasury ALCX is needed to cover the ETH deficit (in an OTC deal or otherwise) and I think it makes the most sense to divert rewards to the ALCX farm to try to create some positive price action on ALCX."
['Looking Ahead - Reward Allocation Suggestions'],"Personally if APY significantly then I'll stop farming ALCX and move on, I think a lot of people from the SLP are in the same boat."
['Looking Ahead - Reward Allocation Suggestions'],"I think this is a good idea, specially taking into account the latest events, currently you have a catch 22 situation were you have increased ALCX sole stalking dumping the APR but on the other hand that does help mitigate the 50% ALCX dumping from the SLP. An increase in the ALCX single stake allocation provided that does not incur in slippage for trades done above the SLP pool would have my support, do we really need to pay 4,2 million a week to avoid slippage? open question"
['Looking Ahead - Reward Allocation Suggestions'],"as an ALCX hodler, I think we need more ALCX buy pressure by incentivizing single stake. Not sure how important it is and what allocation is best "
['Looking Ahead - Reward Allocation Suggestions'],I agree directionally with the proposal.  The SLP seems over incentivized now as evidenced by the very high level of liquidity there on a pair that doesn't see that much swap volume.  Moving some of that incentive to single stake to encourage HODLing makes sense.  How much to do and how quickly to do it is another question.  Going relatively slowly makes sense so that impact can be assessed each time the incentive is reduced.
['Looking Ahead - Reward Allocation Suggestions'],"How about a boosting mechanism for SLP? SLP emmisions are reduced and staking ALCX boosts individual SLP positions by some factor? Like Curve's or Badger DAO's approach? I think Curve's boosting mechanism really incentivize curve staking (I'm speaking without considering locking here, does not matter, though).
edit: perhaps different actions on the platform affects the boosting, thus also incentivize using all features on the platform..."
['Create Metapool between alUSD and alETH pair '],"Hi Fren,
My idea is to create a metapool on Curve that consists of [alUSD-3CRV]-[alETH-[sETH-ETH]], then reallocate ALCX emissions such that providing to this new LP token (holding tokens for 2 asset pairs) is more beneficial than just holding one or the other. We should think of this as expanding to future pairs as [asset1, alAsset1]-[asset2, alAsset2]-... for V2.
What is a Metapool?
Here ser: https://resources.curve.fi/faq/base-and-metapools
The purpose of a metapool is to leverage an existing pool (say 3CRV) and allow it to be traded with another token (alUSD). The suggestion here is to iterate on the two
Why should we link our alAsset pairs?
i. Why this specific link and why Curve? Can be swiftly implemented on Curve protocol (with precedent), as opposed to the coordination required to LP between platforms. al3CRV exists and alETH-[sETH-ETH] has support as seen in snapshot:  due to existing sETH-ETH pool. 
ii. This increases depth of liquidity for all of our alAssets. Allows clean swap from alUSD-ETH, and alETH-3CRV tokens. 
iii. Assuming rewards that outweigh IL, it encourages holding all of our Liquidity Tokens. 
    Suppose 10 alAsset pairs, how shall we encourage people to provide liquidity to each? How do we balance that? This metapool is one proposal.
Quick thoughts on Impermanent Loss
Stable-ETH pairs are precedented. I can see net gain by swap fees and rewards despite IL. It may become riskier when expanded to several alAsset pairs, but specific structures of the metapool can be considered.
"
['Create Metapool between alUSD and alETH pair '],"After some sync ups on Discord in Curve and Alchemix, some new thoughts:
Metapools like described above are a direct a use case of Curve V2. 
The discussion can move towards if we want to incentivize metapools, and if so, which ones. Pls ser, consider our options:
Reward no metapools. When we add new asset classes, we create a new pair (eg [alBTC-BTC]). The community will calculate the appropriate ALCX rewards.
Pro: Can be more granular (?) Managed manually, more stable
Con: May become difficult to manage 
Reward two metapools -- stable and volatile. When we add an asset class, we label it as stable or volatile, then add it to the pool.
With this thinking [alETH-ETH]-[alBTC-BTC] with rewards, and [alUSD-3CRV] evolving to encompass all stables supported by Alchemix.  
Can add a new category other than stable and volatile if this is too restrictive.
Pro: Supposedly less IL.
Con: Does not link all stables. 
Reward large single metapool
Create metapool as described above. All asset class pairs will be in this metapool... 
""One ring to rule them all"" -exHuman on Discord
Pro: Arguably simpler to manage and reward. 
Con: Possibly worsening Impermanent Loss situation. Deep dive required AI 2 
Action items/Open Questions:
1 - How many swaps does it take to go from alETH to DAI with each option? If it is multiple swaps, then don't see the huge benefit to the large megapool. Thus this depends on V2 impl. Plan to check in on Discord.
2 - Target LP token ratios for the protocol. What does it mean to target a ratio of LP tokens? At times we may want more liquidity in a specific asset pair. Do we need a floor of liquidity? how 2 incentivize. 
3 - Reward distribution specifics

if I can deposit a stable coin, and then borrow alETH.
I can maintain my portfolio value while I am able to participate in the market using ETH and get away from risk from ETH price movement.

ETH price go down => the time will be shorter.

The ALCX is a governance token, and should reflect the strength and profitability of the DAO and all of its operations and services it provides.
We need smart and relatively safe ways of conservatively raising the debt caps on alUSD and alETH that bring in more users and more TVL. The issue as I see it preventing this, is that we are rightly managing the risks to the pegs of these assets.
The Yearn alUSD vault was a good idea I thought and good first step towards this, even though Curve are kicking us in the balls a bit about it.
As a DAO let's get our thinking hats on. What can we do, who can we partner with, what further utility can we bring to native al-assets to reduce sell pressure of punters swapping al-assets for more ""meaningful"" assets. If we can get more al-assets doing productive things outside of the swap pools, it is going ensure we can maintain the peg better and keep raising the debt cap, growing the Alchemix ecosystem.
All of this will point to increased upside of the ALCX token and more people speculate on the worth and value of having governance rights, and the potential to share in the 10% yield repayments in the future.

[' Automate alUSD debt cap increases! 🚀 🤖'],"Currently, to raise the alUSD debt cap, the established process is to raise it in million increments (or in terms of around % of current debt cap). This requires us to revisit the approach frequently. Using 2 data points, we have had to raise the cap twice in 10 days (source: me). This is a timely beauraucratic step, and as we see with SLP and curve migrations, devs have to focus on one thing at a time (A.k.a. this is additional dev load).
I see a few options:
Continue to regroup biweekly, more or less, increasing caps in ""bundles"" proposed by devs and community
Remove the alUSD debt cap, releasing the flood gates.
3. Increase the alUSD debt cap as a function of time, instead of manual management.
I will discuss option 3, and initially we can consider increasing the alUSD debt cap by $N million per week. The main question is the proposed shape and slope. Firstly, starting modest seems like the best approach. Secondly, anything is better than nothing. Finally, we do not want to overdo it by allowing too much alUSD mint.
Based on $20 million of alUSD demand going away in 10 days, increasing the cap by $1 million per week linearly, timeboxed in 3 months (12 weeks) would ease customer pain without dev management. We can increase the alUSD mint cap stepwise every hr (my choice), every 24hr, or with each harvest.
Happy to reconsider #s etc., perhaps we're missing something. Any thoughts?"
[' Automate alUSD debt cap increases! 🚀 🤖'],"whalegoddess from your perspective it seems obvious to increase the debt cap whenever we encroach upon it, but we are closely monitoring the health of alUSD and measuring the effects of actions and market conditions to make data driven decisions regarding the parameters we can change.

As far as I know previous cap raises were also something in the order of 10%, 15% or 20% more. The increase percentage doesn't have to be big, could be a measly 2% per increase. For example, if the total debt at the moment is 300 million and you want to increase it with 1 million per week now, I would suggest to phrase it as a 0.33% per week increase instead.
In addition to a timebox I would also suggest to only increase the cap if the total debt is getting close to the cap, maybe like 10%. This way you don't needlessly increase the cap when there's still plenty of debt available and it doesn't balloon unnecessarily out of proportion.

[' Automate alUSD debt cap increases! 🚀 🤖'],"In general, it is an interesting idea to have an automatic debt ceiling increase to lighten the workload for the team at this moment. However, I also believe that we should be very cautious.
As Butler ATTS [Colonel Yunt] stated in the discord (sorry, not able to tag him here):
yea depegging risk is the main concern here
this is the main reason we're capping ETH at 2k at the start of alETH
although we have liquid alUSD/stable markets, there is a point at which the demand for alUSD and sell pressure may force users to transmute, which is something we want to avoid now and in the future
the best way to remove this barrier is to create buy pressure for alUSD and other alAssets. Since we don't have liquidations as an incentive for that demand the best way to do that is additional DeFi integrations. Until we have those we're going to have to live with a gradually increasing debt ceiling and exercise caution in this regard
Furthermore, I believe that there might be other/better solutions when this can get managed by the DAO. In that case, I assume the community will be able to increase the debt cap whenever they want without the  'main team' needing to do all the work."
[' Automate alUSD debt cap increases! 🚀 🤖'],"jerre Yes, this sums up my concerns and I suspect it's the reason not everyone voted to unanimously increase the debt cap by 20% last time. In general I think this is too dangerous to automate. If the peg becomes weak because we continue to flood the market with alUSD or other alAssets that forces people to use the Transmuter which results in a decrease to the yield of borrowers.
A slow measured approach here with semi-frequent votes and discussions on whether we should raise the cap is safer and will make our job of creating a sustainable Alchemix easier. For now I'm strongly against the idea, but if in the future we are able to create a ton of DeFi integrations for alAssets that result in more buy pressure perhaps we can revisit the idea then."
[' Automate alUSD debt cap increases! 🚀 🤖'],"Some additional considerations I have:
When the DAO is live, we will still want to reduce the number of votes/code reviews/churn ops. I don't believe the problem statement (redundant work is required to raise debt cap) goes away with a DAO. 
@Alunara By keeping the limit at linear and choosing the right slope for the line, we are ensuring we will only undermint alUSD, never overmint. We can also use an exponential function with a low % per week (per @Alunara)
Couldn't agree more with caution @jerre. I believe my numbers are modest choices."
[' Automate alUSD debt cap increases! 🚀 🤖'],"Maybe we can automate this task with a formula. We can include for example when alUSD available is below 1M and with certain amount of deposits (DAI) and certain amount in the transmuter (DAI)  (I mean a ratio > x) then we can expand by x% the minting or a fix amount of million alUSD. The developers can create this recipe and we can then change it when we see it is necessary.
What I am trying to say is we can find a formula that fits what the protocol wants and automate this task

[' Automate alUSD debt cap increases! 🚀 🤖'],scoopy Thanks for responding. I can appreciate the work required to monitor the health of the peg especially during potentially destabilizing events. 
[' Automate alUSD debt cap increases! 🚀 🤖'],"All of your discussion on the consequences of the different plans of increasing the debt is well and good but it seems to me that all of you are overlooking one thing, market demand, When the market comes to your door and demands that you accommodate the demand of the market and you are unable to meet that demand then the market moves on to the next door (your competitor). At this time it appears that you do not have competition but tomorrow you will and the customers that you turned away because of self-imposed restrictions will do business with your competitor or may even become your competitor. This brings me to my case wherein I opened an account a month ago and found your platform to be a good idea, so I decided today to double my account and after having deposited I attempted to borrow but was denied due to the restriction on new alUSD this upset me because I had plans for the funds and I am not willing to wait and I was not informed about the restrictions before I went to the trouble and expense of making the deposit, therefore, I have decided that will wait over the weekend and if I am unable to borrow against my deposit Monday I will then withdraw my deposit and move on, never to return and the few people who follow my experience in the crypto market will be advised to avoid Alchimex. If you do not meet ""market demand"" your business dies."

['Community KB Article: Core Principles of Alchemix Function and Solvency'],"Many newcomers to Alchemix end up asking how Alchemix can remain solvent.  This thread aims to collect any analogies or concise mental models from the community to explain the mechanics of Alchemix and help new DAO members get oriented.

Table of invariants and mechanisms which ensure Alchemix's solvency.
(If you see a governance proposal which undermines one of these then tread cautiously 😅 )
| Mechanism  | Benefit |
|---|---|
| Lock principal into an Alchemix run strategy  | Prevents double spend, ensures no-loss of principal |
| Issue interest-free debt against your collateral | User gains risk-minimized, leveraged use of the base asset |
| Pegging Mechanisms | Ensure alAsset maintains equivalent utility to asset |
| Backstop mechanism to reclaim collateral | Security against pegging failure  |
| Token Distribution and Open-Governance | Trust in Governance Decisions |
| Audits, Secure Development | Minimize smart-contract risk |
Resultant Value Props for Users:
1x-2x leverage without interest or risk of liquidation.
Guaranteed to exit the system with principal amount + interest.
Principal received may be denominated in base asset or synthetic debt asset depending on exit mechanism.
""liquidate"" - Alchemix deposits base assets (equivalent to outstanding debt) from the user's collateral in the transmuter.  The system does not reclaim or burn the already issued alAssets.  Users who liquidate get some part of their principal in the already alUSD.
""Repay"" - The user pays down a portion of their debt in the base or synthetic asset.  If the user pays in the base asset then this is sent to the transmuter.  If the user pays in the synthetic asset then the asset is burned, clearing the debt from the system.
""Wait for loan maturation"" - User receives full initial deposit in the base asset and advance on interest in synthetic asset.

['Smart Contract Wallets and Alchemix'],"Is it possible to use a smart contract wallet such as Argent with Alchemix?
For those that don't know: with Argent your wallet is not tied to a seed phrase. If you lose your phone or it's stolen you use a set of trusted devices/people to sign off that you wish to recover your wallet to a new device. My understanding is this creates a new smart contract containing your wallet and transfers your coins to it. This is ethereum's version of multi-sig security. I believe Gnosis Safe is similar, but I'm not confident.
Since it is reasonable to expect that Alchemix-loaned collateral may be locked for years, switching your phone/smart contract wallet instance in this time is highly likely.
My question is, how is collateral tied to me? Is it possible to maintain ownership of my collateral across a wallet transition like this?
If not, does this mean that all Alchemix collateral must stay with only single-signature wallet security models?"

['[AIP-5]Thoughts on Active Yield Management Between BTC/ETH/DAI Vaults'],"In the most recent governance proposal the community voted to take excess DAI in the Transmuter and reinvest it in Yearn to boost the rate of repayment for borrowers of alUSD. This decision has provided a great benefit to users of the protocol, and has created some of the best rates on stables in all of DeFi.
Building on the idea of putting this excess to work, some of the community members in our discord (Yunt Capital) were tossing around an idea that the Transmuter excess could potentially be levered by governance in V2 to actively manage the yield & rate of repayment between each of the three vaults. This would work by reallocating a portion of the yield earned in one collateral type, by using it to market-buy the collateral type of another vault. The effect would be an increase in the rate of repayment in loans against the market-bought asset, and decrease in the rate of repayment in loans against the market sold asset.
For example:
imagine we took a portion of the reinvested DAI in the Transmuter and used that to market-buy ETH, essentially replacing that DAI in the Transmuter with ETH. Doing so would have the effect of increasing the yield and rate of repayment on ETH, thus creating a much more attractive reason to borrow alETH. Conversely, it would decrease the current ""boosted yield"" of DAI and decrease the rate of repayment for alUSD loans. This strategy could be levered in any direction to increase the rate of yield/debt repayment for any of the vaults using yield from another.
For Your Consideration:
The purpose of this post is not to directly propose this as an AIP, or advocate for any specific implementation of this mechanism, but to flesh out the idea as a potential lever that could be added to the DAO; and to facilitate a discussion on the potential benefits, drawbacks, and risks. Listed below are some of our initial thoughts, but it's unlikely that we've thought of everything, so feel free to weigh in with additional considerations or expand on the below to indicate how you feel about it.
Thoughts on Benefits:
Governance would be able to increase yield on any of the three vaults as needed, to be able to consistently provide attractive yield/repayment rates. For assets like ETH which traditionally provide lower yields in DeFi, this might allow us to keep rates competitive with riskier yield sources that we may not want to integrate with.
This may allow ALCX stakers, who participate in governance and receive cash flows in the form of wBTC/ETH/DAI, to configure the allocation of assets they receive.
Governance would have the ability to bootstrap supply of alETH/alBTC/alUSD by incentivizing borrowing, which may be helpful in creating more liquid alToken markets or additional utilities for alTokens in the broader DeFi ecosystem.
Thoughts on Concerns/Risks:
The rate on yields set by governance might become selfishly driven by whatever asset governance holders like best
Market trades of excess yield to another asset could result in slippage up to the preset slippage bound, causing a small net loss on total transmuter excess for every trade
Gas costs for this kind of thing might be significant and worth taking into consideration as well
Introduction of new contracts or additional complexity may be undesirable
Implementation Considerations:
Inverse Finance provides DCA vaults, where yield earned on specific assets is automatically DCAed into a separate asset of your choice. Perhaps we could take the portion of the Transmuter funds that we want to reallocate, deposit into one of these vaults, and DCA the yield into the other collateral of choice. This might be useful in (1) abstracting away the need to manage the trading of excess we wish to reallocate, and (2) saving on gas fees required to perform those transactions.
Over the counter buying could be used to avoid slippage and save money on gas fees as well
This could also just be done manually instead
Credit to @Isthian for being the one to come up with this idea initially."

['[AIP-11] ALCX Token Loan for Market Making'],"The Alchemix team is hard at work trying to expand our presence on centralized exchanges. Expanding market access to ALCX will help to grow our ecosystem in various ways.
For one, countless traders and speculators do not use DEXs, so a stronger CEX presence will help us to expand the number of token holders. Hopefully we can convert some of these speculators into DeFi users as well.
Secondly, if we have healthy markets in both DEXs and CEXs, then it will give us highly reliable price feeds from Chainlink. This is a key upgrade that will help us to expand the scope of Alchemix.
In order to prepare for any upcoming listings, we need to ensure that the markets on these exchanges are healthy enough to allow for trading. Thus, the Alchemix team has engaged with two of the leading Market Making firms in all of cryptocurrency, Alameda and Amber, to provide their services for our CEX trading pairs. By enlisting the services of market makers, we can ensure tighter spreads and less slippage, creating a healthy trading environment on the exchange(s).
We can share most of the details, but please understand some information needs to remain confidential or vague to protect these firms’ operations.
The Deal:
-6 month long ALCX token loans to Alameda and Amber, with option to renew contract once the 6 months is over
-Token loans are uncollateralized. Both parties have written agreements but are also operating on good faith. Both of these firms came from the recommendation and connections of our strategic investors.
-Alameda will borrow 20,000 ALCX
-Amber will borrow 25,000 ALCX
-Each firm will provide $100k market depth both sides within a couple basis points to each major exchange we get on
-Each firm has several tranches of call options for the ALCX on loan. Should ALCX go above these option prices, they have the option to repay in stablecoins instead of ALCX (it should be noted that if these options do get exercised, then all the USD will go to the DAO -- which may actually be seen as a good thing)
Therefore the Alchemix core team is requesting a 6-month loan of 45,000 ALCX to facilitate the CEX markets.
A vote “For” authorizes this loan.
A vote “Against” rejects it.

EDIT:
UPDATE
ok, so I wanna give an update on AIP - 11 for market makers but the forums are experiencing some difficulties, and they are seemingly missing? It's likely we can recover them, but for the time being, I will just update in here with an @everyone
Previous terms were loans totalling 45,000 ALCX for 6 months split between Alameda and Amber, but we have since chosen to go with alternative market makers in place of Alameda.
Current terms are loans totaling 56,000 ALCX to three different market makers, Wintermute, Amber, and Fractal. 
25k to Amber, 6 month minimum contract
25k to Fractal, 6 month minimum contract
6k to Wintermute, 12 month minimum contract
All agreements have a mixture of bullish, more bullish, extremely bullish, and full-on bulltard strikes for stablecoin repayment options in place of repaying the ALCX on loan. If somehow the DAO ends up hitting all of the strikes, then the cash options will enable the DAO to be an omega stablecoin whale, which is not a bad thing imo, some diversification of the treasury is a good thing.
All firms have agreed to not using the ALCX on loan to yield farm.
As we plan to increase our presence on CEXs, this trio of market makers will ensure deep and tight liquidity for traders and speculators across all relevant markets. And with it, we'll grow the Alchemix pie and be able to improve our infrastructure via chainlink price feeds. This will open ALCX up to lots of other exciting partnerships and integrations with other DeFi protocols.
I'd like to put this up for vote within the next 12-24 hours, as much of this has already been discussed when I first presented the AIP and the matter is kind of urgent."
['[AIP-11] ALCX Token Loan for Market Making'],"As of right this moment, it looks like this proposal has not taken it's final form...
More to come as things unfold."
['[AIP-11] ALCX Token Loan for Market Making'],"Been reading all the back and forth in the discord group and thought maybe worth putting down some thoughts here rather than making discord even more crowded.
Bottom line: I'm on the view that more exchange listings and more liquidity is never a bad thing. This worry that market makers will dump ALCX is not only wrong, it's a dangerous notion to peddle. I've done my time on a traditional equities trading floor and you can be dead sure that even the sharks in Canary Wharf and Wall Street don't like to see names where they're MMs collapse. They make way more money on the way up - that's also why stabilisation agents post IPO are such profitable roles to take on. On that point, if the only ""fees"" to be paid to the MMs are the granting of options on the loaned ALCX, that's actually a very good deal - that's literally saying it's a zero management fee, performance fee only model for MMs, which in my former trading floor life would be laughed out of the room by the traders in about 5 seconds in all cases but the bluest of blue chip stocks.
On the flipside, I also completely understand the broader worry raised that if the strikes are too generous (i.e. too low) we're selling out ALCX cheap. I'm inclined (with a bit of Game Theory thinking) to believe that the dev team have all the incentive in the world to pin those strikes HIGH (why not?) and as Scoopy has highlighted multiple times the DAO does receive USD should those strikes be hit and the options are exercised.
Ultimately, as many other community members have pointed out, the bulk of ALCX liquidity remains in the Sushiswap pool and that price will continue to be the main driver of marginal market making in my opinion. Adding CEX liquidity serves to diversify that holder pool and aside from the publicity from a CEX listing, it also allows ALCX to decouple from ETH - so as we wonder wen 1 ALCX = 1 ETH, that reality is much more likely to happen with USD stable-driven liquidity/market making than when dominated by an ETH pair (just think about the incentive of whale LPs with respect to their impermanent loss, how would they benefit if 1 ALCX = 1 ETH??)
Finally, pre-empting the ""but decoupling also means ALCX can dump"" argument I would say - if we believe that there's a reason, in the face of a dump attempt, for us as ALCX community members to join in the dump then we have a much bigger problem than voting on all of these things. Taking my trader hat off and putting the investor hat on, I'm literally ""in it for the tech"", as I'd like to think the rest of us are too. If we don't believe that ALCX can stand on its own two feet when released into the wild, then we're better off having discussions on why to put those issues to bed before we start aiming for 1 ALCX = 1 ETH and higher.
Bottom line: I think this is a great proposal, small leap of faith in terms of pricing/strikes/expiries/terms but if managed properly to coincide with launches of likes of v2 or the alETH vault, it could be a win-win-win for everyone. This absolutely doesn't need to be looked at as zero sum."

['[AIP-11] ALCX Token Loan for Market Making'],"While I am sympathetic to some of the perceived risks noted by many in Discord, I believe the benefits outweigh the cons here:
Diversification of ALCX away from a very highly concentrated pool on Sushi (e.g. more liquidity in different places; this should not be understated)
Opening ALCX to a new audience of investors/HODLers, e.g. the large swath of people who still primarily conduct business on CEXs (I think of this as ""new user acquisition"")
Obvious and tangible infrastructure benefits (e.g. pricing oracle)
I understand the fears around lending out such a large amount of tokens to market-makers, but as @allyourcat aptly noted above, these businesses are built on trust and credibility: they have nothing without it.  The fears of them running off with the tokens, farming them out, or engaging in some other type of nefarious activity are unfounded IMO.  These are credible institutions that specialize in market-making services, and diversifying across three is a pragmatic approach.
I also believe that the team is fully incentivized to put favorable strike prices in place to the benefit of the protocol (e.g. higher strikes, as opposed to low strikes, e.g. ""giving away the house"").
Given all of the above, we will be voting in favor of this proposal."
['Upgraded Platform for the Ecosystem'],"Hello Alchemix,
Summary:
By partnering with Commonwealth, Alchemix would experience an upgraded ecosystem platform specifically built for this community. Commonwealth is looking to increase the amount of  decentralized communities that are on the Common platform.
Abstract:
A governance platform with more capabilities than Alchemix current processes will allow this community to get more done and inevitably grow the Alchemix ecosystem. I am proposing that Alchemix move their governance & general community activities to Commonwealth where this community will be given more tools to grow the Alchemix ecosystem. The major changes are as follows:
Organize all of the community activities that Alchemix does to increase efficiency and expand higher community engagement rates into more areas of governance. I.e.: bucket all hiring activities, discussions, governance proposals, , etc. into unique channels.
Create a community fund built into the governance platform where Alchemix community members can invest in projects that they determine to benefit the Alchemix ecosystem.
Efficiently reach more of the community and expose more on-chain, off-chain, and member data to allow the entire community to make informed decisions.
Commonwealth isn't just a governance interface, it has the capabilities to become the decentralized hub for all of the community activities taking place within Alchemix. Commonwealth is already doing this with a couple other decentralized communities.
Key Feature Upgrades:
Crypto-native discourse with an integration to Snapshot voting, staking dashboard and other new features to Alchemix's governance.
In-depth transparency & analytics for both thread activity and profiles. Profile transparency includes forum activity history, past votes, and more.
On-chain integrated governance dashboard built specifically for decentralized communities. Everyone can receive notifications if they want to and Commonwealth can integrate with Telegram and Discord.
What is Commonwealth?
A few stats / facts:
Is already the go-to-governance interface in the Polkadot Ecosystem, onboarding an average of 1 parachain per week since 2021.
We are rolling out the solution to the Ethereum Ecosystem. The founders of Opyn, SportX, Marlin Protocol, Injective Protocol, Showtime, and many more are in the latest round and will be using Commonwealth as their governance experience, as we roll out to the ecosystem.
Have a growing network effect and have 5k+ signups in alpha and a waiting list of 100+ additional communities that want to use Commonwealth.
Next Steps
The Alchemix team get in touch with Commonwealth to build a testnet on the Commonwealth platform and get the Commonwealth team to build any custom features that the Alchemix community wants to see in the new community forum. Once that's done the existing forum data would be migrated over to Commonwealth."
['Upgraded Platform for the Ecosystem'],"Right now we use Discord, this forum site, and snapshot. It's a fairly simple workflow of discussion (Discord) -> proposal (forum) -> vote (snapshot).

['Upgraded Platform for the Ecosystem'],"Thanks for the great questions! I'll answer these in-line:
1) By adopting Commonwealth, how would this workflow change?
This workflow will only get easier. You will do all discussion and proposals in one forum. On the specific threads, you will see all discussions for the topic. Additionally, voting is only one additional click. While voting you can also check the governance activity (comments, votes, etc.) of those submitting, commenting, and voting on the proposal. In short, you go from 3 sites to one and have easy transparency and tracking along the way.
2) How exactly does this benefit users? Your first three major changes all seem like things we already have, and the ""Key Feature Upgrades:"" seem fairly vague. More details would be appreciated.
Ultimately, we make it really easy for anyone to participate in governance for any project. A couple clicks can get you to the governance forums and proposals for a range of projects. I've listed out our core functionality below, but are also a crypto-native tool with a team of 30 actively improving this every day. Discord and Discourse aren't even crypto tools and have made no indication at improving the functionality for crypto users.
Feature Overview
For Alchemix Core:
Four Tools in One: We are a crypto-native discourse, with an integration to Snapshot voting, staking dashboard, and more.
Staking Dashboard: Along side governance and discussions, we can offer a full staking dashboard. And include chain notifications when you earn a reward / get slashed and more. See Example on Previous UI.
Off-chain to on-chain governance integration: We have full on-chain governance support already for COMP, AAVE, & Substrate Governance. We're able to quickly turnaround (2 - 3 weeks) any customization necessary.
Integrations with Existing Social Channels: We allow you to create webhooks across Telegram, Discord, Slack, and Element to automatically show new proposals and more.
Full Community Analytics: New Address, Forum Posts, Visits, as well as % of Token Holder Participating
For Alchemix Ecosystem Projects:
Same ""full stack"" community experience: We can offer the same all-in-one experience of on-chain governance and more
For token holders:
In-App & Email Notifications: We give all users on-chain notifications in-app, through email, allow users to subscribe to watch interesting on-chain events such as votes and large trades.
Profiles: Explore the voting history, discussion history and on chain activity for any Alchemix holder.
3) How would Commonwealth store/access/transmit data? If it is a middleman is it possible that it could corrupt/change data?
We are a blockchain project ourselves, built on the Edgeware blockchain. All activity is tracked on-chain preventing corruption."
['Staking ALCX'],"Newbie question:  If I stake ALCX by connecting to MM, I pay a fee of $5.99.  Will I be able to unstake at any time and will my fee to unstake be the same $5.99.  I only have 1 ALCX.  I don't want the fee to unstake be so high that it significantly reduces my investment."
['Staking ALCX'],"Emerald731
One other consideration to note: Ethereum transaction fees are not constant.  If it cost you $5.99 to stake your tokens, the cost when you unstake could be different, depending on a variety of factors.
There is a lot of content on this subject matter across the intrawebs, but to get you started, here is a relatively lightweight newbie article on the basics of Ethereum gas, gas prices, etc.
Additionally, this article here will help you understand the best times of days to conduct activity, to limit the burden of fees when transacting on the Ethereum blockchain."
['Staking ALCX'],Obviously this is my first time staking. Is the $5.99 just the gas fee for MM?  ALCX doesn't charge a fee to intiate a stake/unstake?
['Staking ALCX'],Alchemix does not take a fee from staking/unstaking operations. The fee you're supposed to pay is simply the Ethereum network fee.

['Fixed imcome strategy '],"I am thinking of different scenarios for using the Alchemix protocol. I am inquiring if this use case is possible and correct.
For understanding the protocol in simple terms as it is currently, a user can deposit DAI into the Vault and take out 50% of their collateral and let interest earned pay off the balance of the loan over time. Much like a “more favorable” cash secure loan from a bank, correct?
Now, if one chooses only to deposit DAI and not take on any debt, they receive interest in the form of credited alUSD to use on a future loan, right?
Is it possible for an individual to use this protocol as a fixed income strategy; in the form of a person depositing DAI and only take out the earned credit of alUSD on a set weakly or monthly schedule?.
Aside from the standard smart contract risk, gas prices, and one currency losing its peg, a variable would be the fluctuating APR on the yearn DAI vault, correct?
When taking into account risks and APR fluctuation, would there be any other apparent cons (excluding taxes)?
Thank you"
['Fixed imcome strategy '],"inhibitor128 Is it possible for an individual to use this protocol as a fixed income strategy; in the form of a person depositing DAI and only take out the earned credit of alUSD on a set weakly or monthly schedule?
Yes. Absolutely possible to do.
Biggest con about this (adding to the possible issues you could face that you already mentioned) is opportunity cost as you're putting your DAI somewhere and leave it to work. Although it is not time-locked and you could retrieve it at any time if there's no outstanding loan going on, but still."
['Fixed imcome strategy '],"inhibitor128
While you can certainly sit back and earn the yield on your Vault in the form of alUSD, one of the key benefits of using this protocol is that, instead of waiting years to earn a meaningful amount of interest, you can start using that interest today.
For example, if you put $10,000 of DAI into the vault, if the prevailing 12.7% APY held constant, it would take four years to earn $5,000 of interest (see 0xDef1's amazing calculator here).  Instead of waiting four years, you could take that $5,000 out TODAY, and redeploy it into other yield-generating strategies (all the while your ""loan"" is being paid off in parallel).
One other consideration for your stated strategy:  you should think about whether or not the incremental yield you are earning is worth the additional risk.  For example, if you are simply putting your DAI into the Vault to earn interest in the form of alUSD (and not take out a loan), you're earning about 3-4% more than if you had just put that DAI into the Yearn V2 vault directly.  The incremental ""risk"" you are taking in doing so spans the alUSD stablecoin peg, slippage/fees in converting alUSD to DAI, and protocol risk (e.g. Alchemix is one additional layer of smart contract risk beyond Yearn).

Thank you

['Post-mortem Transparency Request'],"
I had noticed this primary difference aside from the various code style differences and variable name choices. Was this the root cause of the mis-calculation?"
['Post-mortem Transparency Request'],"dr00shie yes, this was the offending line.  upon depositing, the user's reward debt did not update to account for the gap between the beginning of rewards accumulation and when the user deposited. the result was the user was then credited w/ rewards starting from the beginning of rewards accumulation (instead of considering that amount as ""reward debt"")."
['Redirect Dividends toward Protocol Growth Funds'],"A major draw of DAO staking will be the ability for ALCX holders to receive dividend distributions from the protocol through the 10% fee on yield. While these payments attract capital to the ALCX token, I believe Alchemix would be better suited in the long run if these early dividends were reinvested back into the protocol. 
Ideally, I see these dividends instead being pooled as follows:
Grant Programs
Productive Treasury Assets (stETH, alUSD3CRV, etc.)
Partnership Ventures/buying tokens of protocols we seek to cooperate with in order to have a collective say in their governance (Yearn, Barnbridge, Olympus)

I see these funds as further supports to the structure phenomenal structure Alchemix has built for itself up to now. As for the timeline on this, 6 months would provide a balance of deep funds and flexibility (IMO). Enough from me though, happy to turn this over to my fellow ALCX bag-holders, Pickler Jarers, and Yearn Apes."
['Redirect Dividends toward Protocol Growth Funds'],"Some points made after further discussion:
Since ALCX is slashed to maintain alUSD peg, dividends are more necessary for Alchemix than most other protocols. This is because dividends rewards holders in such a way to hopefully outweigh this slashing risk.
Additionally, dividends could be more reasonably reduced once we get a sense of dividend APY. If it's high enough, it could make sense to redirect a portion toward growth funds. "
['Redirect Dividends toward Protocol Growth Funds'],"I makes sense to do a mix of dividend payouts, a separate endaoment to pay for operational costs, and reinvestments into the dao tvl. If they are parameterized, we can adjust as needed how much of the pie gets divvied up. The DAO will also be rewarding in ALCX, so even if the dividend yields start low, they will grow with time while the alcx emission rate lowers over time. "
['Private Discussions'],"To better help our users with detailed issues regarding transactions, we've now included a function to start private conversations with individual users.
That way you'll be able to share things like addresses and transaction Ids with us to better help you when you're stuck somewhere along the way.
Also worth mentioning: only moderators can create private discussions, so don't worry about someone trying to catfish you.
Once you've received a private message it will show up under the notification bell in the top right of the forum.

From what I understand the APR is 2x for this week to make up for lost time as a result of the bug from last week’s initial implementation, so judging by the current state of the pool c 360% APR once next week comes along it should be back to 170-180% APR as it was in the ALCX-ETH SLP pool before, maybe with an extra 1%+ or so from the additional SUSHI rewards.

['[AIP - 12] Raise the Debt Cap'],"After raising the debt cap to 115m, we have hit the limit yet again. Things in the system look healthy. The transmuter has fulfilled its role in boosting yields and arbing alUSD back to peg. In fact, alUSD is over peg at the moment. When we launch alETH, however, we will begin phasing out rewards for the alUSD-only pool. Because of this, I'm proposing a modest cap increase of 10m to bring the total to 125m. This should satiate demand at least until the launch of alETH. We will closely monitor effects from the discontinuation of the alUSD-only pool. If the system is healthy and the debt ceiling is at capacity after that, we will increase it again.

['[AIP-9] Adept Mode Farming (alETH)'],"With the launch of the alETH pool, we have to rebalance the emissions to accommodate alETH/ETH LP in our stakingPools.sol farming contract. The community was largely in agreement with a proposed re-weighting, but had some contention with what to do about the alUSD-only pool. Here are the choices for Adept mode:
Option 1:
58% ETH/ALCX SLP
18% ALCX only
18% alUSD3CRV LP
6% alETH/ETH LP
Option 2:
58% ETH/ALCX SLP
18% ALCX only
18% alUSD3CRV LP
5.5% alETH/ETH LP
0.5% alUSD only
(and then transition to the parameters of Option 1 in two weeks)
Option 1 elects to retire the alUSD-only pool all at once.
The rationale is that the pool is widely regarded as a misallocation of resources. The team and community also has been signaling that this would end for some time now, so the sooner this is retired, the better.
Option 2 elects to reduce rewards significantly now, and then in 2 weeks adjust the weights to the the values in Option 1.
The rationale for Option 2 is that with the 48m alUSD in that pool, if all of it were to go to the curve pool at once, it might temporarily destabilize the peg. It is possible that by phasing it out gradually, we can ensure minimal disruption to the system and avoid any sudden shock.

After a day or two I'll compile this and format it properly and post the official version to the alchemix forums. Try to keep comments fairly concise, goal is to capture the main points, not every single thing that was said)
alETH items
Yearn has a new ETH vault coming that they are completing testing on. We are waiting to hear back on when it will be ready. If it’s not ready quickly, then we’ll launch alETH with the current yearn vault.
Yearn devs recommended some changes that are being implement to the ALCX vault in order to make it easier to migrate to new vault versions in the future
Launching in approximately 10 days max (depends on what we hear back from yearn on their timeline)
Collateralization discussion generally appears in favor of 400% but there are drawbacks. General consesnsus is to be conservative to start (maximizing stability/security), and over the following weeks start to reduce with an eventual target of 200%.
alETH is a whole new beast so gotta be careful with it, General theme is about the priority being security, stability, and maintaining peg.
Some discussion that starting with 400% may lose out on some people who discover the protocol and then leave since 400% isn’t as attractive – however the example was given that SNX started with 750% and grew just fine (also points out that 400% really isn’t THAT conservative to start with). So if we launch with 400%, the goal is to make it clear at launch that 400% will be decreased.
Someone proposed creating a new ETH only pool, with a small share of ALCX rewards, that would then be used to boost the alETH vault yields (in the transmuter), say like a 30 day lockup. Somewhat controversial, and an intriguing idea, but not enough time to figure it out for alETH. Keep it in mind for future launches.
Keep in mind it's easy to start with 400% and lower it, but it's harder to increase
Part of proposing 400% ratio will be that 2 weeks after launch of alETh we'll put up a snapshot to vote to lower the collateralization ratio to 300%
There will be a new function to swap ETH for alETH – the ETH goes straight to transmuter to boost yield. This solves the problem of having to self liquidate to obtain alETH/ETH (which would be even harder with 400% collat)
alETH to ETH tool will be pretty front and center as it’s beneficial for the protocol when people to ETH to alETH
There will be no cap on how much ETH you can swap for alETH
Likely taking 2% from alUSD, ALCX only, and SLP pool. There is a little bit of backlash on reducing the SLP too much, but partially because SLP just dropped recently.
The thought is things will balance out. Many SLP users will probably migrate to alETH only, and then keep some of their ALCX for single staking. Which should make SLP more attractive. Essentially there will be so many staking options that if the market is even somewhat rational (LOL) it should all balance out.
There was some discussion on significantly reducing the ALCX only pool. Consensus is not to harm the ALCX only pool too much, given its noob friendly and it is the main tool for pure ALCX bulls. However, the intent is to cut down on the BRR over time (partially because eventually the DAO fee share will replace the ALCX farming rewards, and because long term ALCX only is not necessary for platform stability)
[Main point of contention] Original plan was to just kill alUSD pool when we launch alETH. There was an idea to keep 0.5% in alUSD first to not shock the system, then kill it off a week or two later. Initially we’ll do 5.5% for the alETH/ETH SLP, then bump that to 6% when alUSD pool is phased out.
Arguments for keeping 0.5%: 
The curve pool has about 70m alUSD, if 60m alUSD pours in there we’d be under peg. There have been people arbing the pool, if it’s small gap they probably won’t though
The reason dropping to 0.5% works is because a large chunk of stakers will leave, which then raises the reward for remaining people, who will then stick around until the pool is killed. Ie, it splits up the system shock into two events rather than one.
Arguments for immediately killing alUSD:
Lots of alUSD will probably go to stake on CRV or pay down debt in the system, so not truly a 60m shock to the pool
Some concerns that we signaled strongly that alUSD would be nerfed when alETH launched - people strategized around this. So we may want to stick to our word.
Farm won’t be ready right away – need alETH first to make an LP token, so probably 2-3 days where there is no market for alETH, so that’s probably when you should get your alETH 😉 😉
Summary of the two governance proposals:
​​​​​​​​​​​​​​alUSD: nuke it when alETh launches, or do 0.5% when alETH launches and drop to 0% 2 weeks later
alETH: Start with 400% collat, 5.5% rewards (1.5%-2% from alUSD, 2% from ALCX only, 2% from SLP), after 2 weeks vote on reducing to 300% collat.
Misc Items
Scoopy missed the first part of the meeting due to falling asleep on their keyboard (<3 you scoopy don't kill yourself too much)
Goal to get alUSD into a lot of things – Alchemix platform assets will extend far beyond the ALCX ecosystem
Scoopy is working with ruler for some markets using ALCX and alUSD as Collateral
Unlocks are coming soon, but Scoopy does not expect major dumpage. As an example, some new investors want OTC deals, however the treasury can’t sell more ALCX OTC this year per the constraints of the previous deals. So Scoopy asked the currenty ALCX investors if they wanted to sell OTC and none of them wanted to, ie none are looking to take profit – ie don’t expect a dump with unlocks coming soon
In Alchemix V2 (of which the DAO is a part of, target later this year) you can build on top of alchemix’s smart contracts
When moving over to Sushi all the rewards will be sent there – so if you remain in the current SLP pool, you won’t get rewards. Happening on Sunday 5/30, specific time TBD. Regardless of alETH launch date.
There is a general goal to not require too many calls like this, and to not make too many changes, since people have lives.
Help and contribute where you can, use the protocol, spread the word,
Alchemix mods tip generously, and this community is wonderful, tons of peer and self moderation, people helping, everyone is very appreciative of the community
And the community loves Alchemix too <3
Gorby is scheduling tips for people who explain the protocol – literally scheduling tips. So take the hint, be helpful.
​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Per Scoopy, governance call was beneficial, was actually productive, actually helped the platform. (however per notes above, we don't want to do this too often)

['Comprehensive fee overview?'],"Is there an overview of the fees for each Alchemix interaction?
I'm not sure which junctures in interacting with Alchemix carry fees, and of those, what the fee estimates are. I'm moderately experienced, with both custodial & non-custodial wallets, delegated stake on a few alts, etc. Looking at this, I can't tell if there are fees at the following junctures:
Depositing DAI
Borrowing alUSD against DAI
Staking alUSD
Compounding / Adding staking rewards back into the staking pool
Unstaking alUSD or repaying with alUSD/DAI
Withdrawing funds from the protocol back into Metamask.
Can someone share their experience of what requires fees and what those fees generally run?"
['Comprehensive fee overview?'],"Every transaction on the Ethereum network will cost a fee. The amount of the fee is determined by what exactly is required of that transaction, and the cost of the fee is determined by the current gas prices in the network.

Now as for how much each of those actions cost on Alchemix I personally can't say as I don't know, but I'm sure someone does. Feel free to hit up our discord and ask some of our resident nerds there as well! https://discord.gg/zAd6dzgwaj"
['Comprehensive fee overview?'],"n4n0 Thanks for the response, but I'm still unsure what constitutes a ""transaction"" within this environment.

['Comprehensive fee overview?'],"I'm referring to the above bullet points. I am not sure which of the above items will trigger a transaction in metamask. my point in starting this thread is I want to have an understanding of what fees come with this so that I can budget accordingly and know how much DAI I'll need for this to be worthwhile.
I feel like my original post was rather thorough. Maybe just consult that?"
['Comprehensive fee overview?'],"Timslegacy Now I want to exchange for alUSD and the gas fee on Metamask is 0,54 Eth.   This makes the entire process pointless as the gas fee is way too high.
0.54 ETH is too high, unless you tried a week ago when the gas prices spiked to 1000+ gwei.
This is likely Metamask throwing an error because some parameter of the transaction isn't right. When this happens, Metamask will assume the maximum gas limit, resulting in outrageous costs. You should never send a transaction like that, as it will just fail and take your money.
It might be that you tried to mint alUSD when the alUSD debt ceiling was reached. Or perhaps the ""max"" button, if you used it, rounded up to a higher number. You could try to slash that ""max"" number to only 2 or 3 decimals. and see if Metamask gives you a more reasonable gas cost.
StreetCred I feel like my original post was rather thorough. Maybe just consult that?
All the points in your OP involve an Ethereum transaction, and hence a gas fee. Unlike Celsius Network, Alchemix is decentralized. You can reasonably assume every step of the process will require a transaction.
Transactions for smart contracts like this generally range in the 60k to 120k gas limit (Metamask will generally estimate higher, for safety). If you're unsure what gas limit maps to in dollars, you can head to https://ethgasstation.info/calculatorTxV.php and play around with the numbers there.
As things stand, I'd say the minimum to make Alchemix worth it would be in the 4 figures range, or at the very least high 3 figures. Depositing DAI, minting alUSD and trading alUSD for anything else would likely cost you somewhere between 0.01 ETH and 0.02 ETH right now, or between $25 and $50 at current prices. This is with gas prices being low lately.
If you're specifically interested in the staking and compounding part (rather than just taking a loan on your future yield), it might be best to look at an aggregator that automatically compounds for you, like pickle.finance."
['Comprehensive fee overview?'],"I have raised a question on the Gas fees as well.  Presently I am trying out the borrowing process.  On depositing the 117Dai, the fee was $24 in Eth.

['Farm Migrations Timing '],"Hi Alchemix community, been really amazing to see the network do so well under such volatile times in the markets. 
Been following the Farm Migration posts on medium (the latest - https://alchemixfi.medium.com/farm-migrations-how-to-fb4754fa10b2 ), and wanted to ask this great community just one question:
Staking on Convex - this integration makes a ton of sense, good to see this happening. My question here is mainly to verify that ALCX will also be claimed through the Convex interface. Currently, Convex shows a calculated APY from boosted CRV, as well as CVX rewards. To the best of my understanding (using the latest post as a guide), staking through Convex should yield CRV, CVX, and ALCX, but ALCX isn't currently showing up as claimable on the Convex interface. Will ALCX rewards be added sometime soon? Would be great to know, and sorry if I missed an obvious part to this entire question. 
Thanks in advance for anyone who jumps in with any answers.
"

['Advisory/BizOps Committee'],"Since this has been discussed on the governance-proposal discord channel I thought it might be useful to bring it to the forum for larger/more specific input from the community.
Essentially, as Scoopy noted and we have seen, the project continues to grow and have opportunities for many ""biz"" strategies. These range from listing opportunities to integration partners. With the core team busy building what we all know and love, the project, the idea of having some trusted level of elected advisory makes some sense IMO.  This is a rough outline of what I would suggest.
Advisory Committee nominated and elected upon by community with responsibilities to investigate, research and recommend when business opportunities arise as the core team/community requests their input.
The committee should be 3-7 people (off number of elected to break ties) with one (1) year annual terms and re-election.
Advisory members should expect to spend and commit to at least 8 hours a month of work, this could be writing/reviewing proposals, meeting with team, project interviews or other responsibilities.
Nominations should come from community but I would suggest that the core team hold some increased weight to either have one or more (automatic) members as well so the advisory group has a real ear to the ground on the deals/opportunities.
Any NDA or document that needs to be in place to protect IP and biz/project should be in place to give both team and community comfort that the advisory has alignment with the best interests.
Finally, the DAO should have the ability to replace this board by majority vote if it becomes unnecessary or there is a better ""V2"" that the community elects to pursue. This board is not the ""voice"" the community but rather one of them, elected to advise and guide both the team and community as best it can.
Would recommend a mix of experience but background in startups, blockchain, finance and/or tradfi VC would probably be helpful although there are many viewpoints and experiences which can be a net positive.
Those are just my two gwei, let's discuss! I love the concept and hope we can get this done with the core team's blessing and community governance model that has served us well to day.

['Advisory/BizOps Committee'],"Killer idea Scoopy and great initial talking points Weinstein! I am in favor of this concept as it broadens the scope of honest actors within the system.

But they would not be contributing to the discussion/negotation or anything. Basically just there to be a group of people to understand, ask and answer dev questions, but not interface directly with clients. That would be best IMO, we still want the core team being the only ones actually handling deals, unless they specifically ask the committee to do something (ie, the committee should generally not be taking initiative)"

['Advisory/BizOps Committee'],ov3rkoalafied I agree with this and believe that this type of proposal should include a removal mechanism.
['Advisory/BizOps Committee'],"Thanks for putting together the starting point Weinstein. Adding my thoughts to continue the conversation.
I think it's important that this adds value to Alchemix and isn't duplicative. In my view, the committee should be a representation of the investor base and able to make certain delegated decisions for that group. I dont think we gain anything by forming a board that replicates the Strategic Partners and/or Trusting Investors. There will of course be some overlap but it shouldn't be a carbon copy.
That being said, I agree with the points by Weinstein but think this needs to be much more specific in final version. The board should have delegated authority over the Treasury under a certain amount to make decisions with reporting responsibilities to the broader DAO. I dont have a view of the specific delegated number but in general, I view the token grant to a Tier-1 exchange as a board decision versus the ALCX token loan for market making as a decision for the broader investor base with a recommendation from the board. Either way, there needs to be a high amount of transparency between the core team, board and broader DAO on decisions made and why. I think the ALCX team has done a good job setting the example that should be followed by all involved.
I also think there needs to be some type of materiality of investment (to be defined) from each board member. That can be verified by Scoopy and team, but there needs to be a clear alignment from a monetary perspective and I dont feel anyone can represent the investor base without being one.
Last comment from my end - This should be a cut and dry setup with clear and defined responsibilities, incentives and timelines. The goal here should be to build the expertise/resource base of ALCX, make decisions quicker, provide another voice to the community and free up the core teams time.
Thanks - PIrateed
"
['Advisory/BizOps Committee'],"I think this is a really important topic that could have major implications for the direction of Alchemix and lots of DeFi/DAOs in general. Creating a decision making body within a decentralized organization should not be taken lightly. The potential for concentrated decision making influence on a project, despite the best of intentions in the early days, could risk undermining the tenets of a DAO.
All that being said, it's also obvious that there would be benefits having a group of individuals which can represent the interests of the community and help to guide the project forward, while reducing workload on the devs.
The issue I see, is what system would be created to delegate said individuals, and what would be the extent of their decision making. Let us also remember that creating multiple groups (devs, VC, community oversight) also adds complexity to the org management such as decision making and communication.
Are there some examples from other DAOs that have worked well/poorly that we could consider for guiding if/how we go about forming this type of committee?"
['Alchemix x OlympusDAO Partnership: alUSD-3crv Bonds'],"Summary: 
OlympusDAO x Alchemix partnership to introduce new OHM reserve bonds utilizing the alUSD-3crv pool LP tokens.
Abstract: 
Olympus is entering a new phase as it seeks to bolster its treasury through partnerships with other protocols. Olympus can leverage its unique bonding mechanism, in which it acquires assets through the sale of OHM, to help partners achieve sustainable liquidity for their most important pairs. 
Maintaining a 1:1 alUSD:USD peg is central to the Alchemix Dai vault. To date, the peg has remained strong due to a combination of robust liquidity, market incentives and a backstop in the form the Transmuter, which ensures that alUSD can be redeemed 1:1 for DAI. Much of the ~$400 million in liquidity in the curve pool is attributable to liquidity mining incentives, with the pool earning 2900 ALCX per week. 
By creating OHM bonds that would allow Olympus to acquire alUSD-3crv LP tokens, Alchemix can reduce its reliance on liquidity incentives and ensure that substantial liquidity remains locked in the Olympus treasury. Furthermore, these bonds can serve as a test run for other LP assets in the future including alUSD/OHM, ALCX/OHM, alETH/ETH, etc.
Benefits for Alchemix:
alUSD-3crv liquidity “locked” in the Olympus treasury, forming a liquidity floor
Reduce pool reliance on liquidity mining incentives
Free up ALCX for other pool incentives 
Olympus will never sell ALCX tokens earned through staking; while Olympus will maintain the tokens for governance, they can be viewed as “burned” from a market perspective
Benefits for Olympus:
Increase and diversify treasury assets
New form of productive backing
Treasury earns ALCX and Curve rewards in addition to swap fees
Proof of concept
Mechanics:
Liquidity providers to the alUSD-3crv pool sell their LP tokens to Olympus in exchange for OHM that vests linearly over 5 days. The trade is attractive when these “bonds” offer a substantial discount on the market price of OHM. As rewards are claimed, they can either be staked to earn more OHM or sold (perhaps to for a now larger LP position).
The Olympus treasury holds the LP tokens and uses the underlying value to back the minting of OHM. The treasury will never sell or breakup the LP position unless price of OHM falls below intrinsic.
Considerations for Alchemix:
OHM Price falling below 1 Dai, however unlikely, could result in LP position being removed
Considerations for Olympus:
3crv contains centralized stablecoins – USDT and USDC 
alUSD falling below peg for sustained period would result in loss for the treasury
"
['Alchemix x OlympusDAO Partnership: alUSD-3crv Bonds'],"I love this idea and echo everything said by JaLa and RogueItachi. This would be a beautiful symbiotic relationship between OHM and The only risk I could imagine is that if the OHM treasury were to buy the majority of LP tokens we may become dependent on the success of OHM in not needing to ever liquidate it’s treasury assets. Despite that, I agree with @RogueItachi that the benefits greatly outweigh that, both in terms of the flexibility it gives us in directing emission allocations, but also in providing a safe floor of liquidity for the Curve pool.
My questions would be:
Is there any way to actively monitor the bonding price to be able to easily determine when that discount is present? 
Considering how beneficial this would be for Alchemix, is it worth adding an indicator somewhere in the UI with a link to purhase OHM using LP tokens?"
['Alchemix x OlympusDAO Partnership: alUSD-3crv Bonds'],"I love this idea. I think it's a great synergy between two awesome protocols. We pay a lot in ALCX to keep that 3 Curve Pool highly liquid and stable. If Olympus is able to bond enough LP and create a strong floor of liquidity, that would be super valuable. In the future, we could shift those rewards to new vaults like the alETH/ETH. The benefits well outweigh the risks on this one in my opinion. And if this is successful, it could be done with future curve pools like alETH/ETH and alBTC/BTC which would increase the diversity, fees, and rewards of Olympus' DAO and lock up a lot of liquidity for us.

So if we use the example that you used, if my borrow limit increases from 50 alUSD to 60 alUSD and I take out 10 alUSD, does that mean I will not have taken out a loan? I will have nothing that has to be repaid?
Add-on question from that scenario - our borrow limit is half our deposit amount. Does that mean if our borrow limit increases by 10 alUSD (from 50 to 60 etc.), that an additional 10 DAI was farmed during the harvest? If yes, where does this DAI go if it is not compensated to us?
Thank you for your help!"
['I deposited DAI into Alchemix. Will I get interest?'],"James1091 
1) the extra 10 alUSD in this scenario is considered a credit because you had collateral generating yield in the system. taking out 10 alUSD would not count toward your debt. you can think of it as the yield you would have gained by depositing directly into yearn, but you collect it in alUSD.
2) yes, that additional 10 DAI was allocated to your account (proportionally) from the harvest. the DAI flows into the transmuter so that it available for users to transmute alUSD into DAI 1:1."

This is a UI issue as it currently (afaik, pls scoopy smite me if I say bs) doesn't really account for ""free debt"" and will just give an estimate nonetheless.
James1091 Is ALL the yield from that DAI added to a users borrow limit or is only some of it?
All of the incoming rewards that are a result of your collateral being used to farm are added to your borrow limit. A cut is taken out however to feed the transmuter.
James1091 would that mean that taking out a loan makes more sense than leaving your DAI in the Vault?
It depends, really. If you're just leaving DAI in your vault without taking a loan, you'd be able to take out alUSD ""loans"" every now and then that won't count as debt. However that way you're basically looking at a very generic yield farming function with possibly being hit by opportunity cost. The other way would be to get a loan and use that while it pays itself off."

Then you can stake the converted token into other protocols or if applicable even alchemix pools.
But let's assume the alUSD pool isn't going anywhere, then you'd be just fine to drop the alUSD into it and just farm whatever APY it currently provides. It'd be a net positive outcome in dollar value although you may be subject to opportunity cost.

['[AIP10] - Initial Parameters for the Launch of alETH'],"As discussed in the governance call, the proposal for the initial parameters for the launch of alETH are as follows:
Collateralization ratio: 400%
Debt Cap: 2000 alETH
The rationale for these parameters is to prioritize the establishment of a soft peg for alETH. The collateralization ratio being so high is to ensure that ample ETH is flowing to the Transmuter, which helps to strengthen the peg and increase yields in the system. The debt ceiling being 2000 alETH initially is also to ensure that the supply doesn’t balloon too fast so that we can establish a market for alETH.
It is to be noted that these are just the initial launch parameters. We will be monitoring several factors including tvl, the alETH peg, transmuter tvl, and system yield. As agreed upon in the governance call, we will revisit these initial parameters two weeks post launch, giving the community the option to relax some of these parameters.
A “For” vote indicates your acceptance of this proposal.
An “Against” vote indicates your rejection of this proposal and a desire to go with an alternative launch plan.

(notes are organized by topic, rather than in chronological order. Please make a comment in any location that I've gotten incorrect, or am missing information. After a day or two I'll compile this and format it properly and post the official version to the alchemix forums. Try to keep comments fairly concise, goal is to capture the main points, not every single thing that was said)
alETH items
Yearn has a new ETH vault coming that they are completing testing on. We are waiting to hear back on when it will be ready. If it’s not ready quickly, then we’ll launch alETH with the current yearn vault.
Yearn devs recommended some changes that are being implement to the ALCX vault in order to make it easier to migrate to new vault versions in the future
Launching in approximately 10 days max (depends on what we hear back from yearn on their timeline)
Collateralization discussion generally appears in favor of 400% but there are drawbacks. General consesnsus is to be conservative to start (maximizing stability/security), and over the following weeks start to reduce with an eventual target of 200%.
alETH is a whole new beast so gotta be careful with it, General theme is about the priority being security, stability, and maintaining peg.
Some discussion that starting with 400% may lose out on some people who discover the protocol and then leave since 400% isn’t as attractive – however the example was given that SNX started with 750% and grew just fine (also points out that 400% really isn’t THAT conservative to start with). So if we launch with 400%, the goal is to make it clear at launch that 400% will be decreased.
Someone proposed creating a new ETH only pool, with a small share of ALCX rewards, that would then be used to boost the alETH vault yields (in the transmuter), say like a 30 day lockup. Somewhat controversial, and an intriguing idea, but not enough time to figure it out for alETH. Keep it in mind for future launches.
Keep in mind it's easy to start with 400% and lower it, but it's harder to increase
Part of proposing 400% ratio will be that 2 weeks after launch of alETh we'll put up a snapshot to vote to lower the collateralization ratio to 300%
There will be a new function to swap ETH for alETH – the ETH goes straight to transmuter to boost yield. This solves the problem of having to self liquidate to obtain alETH/ETH (which would be even harder with 400% collat)
alETH to ETH tool will be pretty front and center as it’s beneficial for the protocol when people to ETH to alETH
There will be no cap on how much ETH you can swap for alETH
Likely taking 2% from alUSD, ALCX only, and SLP pool. There is a little bit of backlash on reducing the SLP too much, but partially because SLP just dropped recently.
The thought is things will balance out. Many SLP users will probably migrate to alETH only, and then keep some of their ALCX for single staking. Which should make SLP more attractive. Essentially there will be so many staking options that if the market is even somewhat rational (LOL) it should all balance out.
There was some discussion on significantly reducing the ALCX only pool. Consensus is not to harm the ALCX only pool too much, given its noob friendly and it is the main tool for pure ALCX bulls. However, the intent is to cut down on the BRR over time (partially because eventually the DAO fee share will replace the ALCX farming rewards, and because long term ALCX only is not necessary for platform stability)
[Main point of contention] Original plan was to just kill alUSD pool when we launch alETH. There was an idea to keep 0.5% in alUSD first to not shock the system, then kill it off a week or two later. Initially we’ll do 5.5% for the alETH/ETH SLP, then bump that to 6% when alUSD pool is phased out.
Arguments for keeping 0.5%: 
The curve pool has about 70m alUSD, if 60m alUSD pours in there we’d be under peg. There have been people arbing the pool, if it’s small gap they probably won’t though
The reason dropping to 0.5% works is because a large chunk of stakers will leave, which then raises the reward for remaining people, who will then stick around until the pool is killed. Ie, it splits up the system shock into two events rather than one.
Arguments for immediately killing alUSD:
Lots of alUSD will probably go to stake on CRV or pay down debt in the system, so not truly a 60m shock to the pool
Some concerns that we signaled strongly that alUSD would be nerfed when alETH launched - people strategized around this. So we may want to stick to our word.
Farm won’t be ready right away – need alETH first to make an LP token, so probably 2-3 days where there is no market for alETH, so that’s probably when you should get your alETH 😉 😉
Summary of the two governance proposals:
​​​​​​​​​​​​​​alUSD: nuke it when alETh launches, or do 0.5% when alETH launches and drop to 0% 2 weeks later
alETH: Start with 400% collat, 5.5% rewards (1.5%-2% from alUSD, 2% from ALCX only, 2% from SLP), after 2 weeks vote on reducing to 300% collat.
Misc Items
Scoopy missed the first part of the meeting due to falling asleep on their keyboard (<3 you scoopy don't kill yourself too much)
Goal to get alUSD into a lot of things – Alchemix platform assets will extend far beyond the ALCX ecosystem
Scoopy is working with ruler for some markets using ALCX and alUSD as Collateral
Unlocks are coming soon, but Scoopy does not expect major dumpage. As an example, some new investors want OTC deals, however the treasury can’t sell more ALCX OTC this year per the constraints of the previous deals. So Scoopy asked the currenty ALCX investors if they wanted to sell OTC and none of them wanted to, ie none are looking to take profit – ie don’t expect a dump with unlocks coming soon
In Alchemix V2 (of which the DAO is a part of, target later this year) you can build on top of alchemix’s smart contracts
When moving over to Sushi all the rewards will be sent there – so if you remain in the current SLP pool, you won’t get rewards. Happening on Sunday 5/30, specific time TBD. Regardless of alETH launch date.
There is a general goal to not require too many calls like this, and to not make too many changes, since people have lives.
Help and contribute where you can, use the protocol, spread the word,
Alchemix mods tip generously, and this community is wonderful, tons of peer and self moderation, people helping, everyone is very appreciative of the community
And the community loves Alchemix too <3
Gorby is scheduling tips for people who explain the protocol – literally scheduling tips. So take the hint, be helpful.
​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Per Scoopy, governance call was beneficial, was actually productive, actually helped the platform. (however per notes above, we don't want to do this too often)
For future meetings, use the governance proposals channel to chat during the meeting

['Historical Reporting of DAI APY & Est. Maturity Date'],"Helloooo,
Wondering if there is maybe some reporting that captures historical DAI APY% and Est. Date of Maturity over time. Currently logging it manually but was hoping there is something easier. Especially before alETH and V2 comes out and I throw in all my ETH and start messing around. Want to have a grasp of these two factors."
['Alchemix Request For Comment (ARC) #1'],"The Alchemix dev team is nearly complete with the expansion to add an alETH vault, transmuter, and farm. This document is Scoopy’s vision for how to launch alETH, but comments/suggestions for improvement are encouraged.
Alchemix Vault Parameters: Collateral Ratio: 400%
Current yvWETH yields are 3-4%. A 200% collateralization ratio would mean loan repayment times of up to 10-15 years. At 400%, this would be lowered to 5-7 years. Still a long time, but much more reasonable than the alternative. If ETH yields increase in general, or are boosted via the transmuter, this value could be revisited.
alETH Debt Cap: 2000 alETH
It is important to distinguish that this is NOT a supply cap for alETH, but rather the maximum amount of alETH that can be minted via debt. The supply can expand when people repay their loans using ETH, much like how alUSD has a 360m supply with only a 100m debt cap. By setting the supply cap on the lower side, we can take a conservative approach, limiting the system’s alETH debt to not exceed 2000 alETH. This limit can be increased at a later time if it makes sense to do so.
Eth to alETH direct Purchases
The v1 contract already has a roundabout way of trading DAI for alUSD 1:1 via the liquidate function. We can add a convert ETH to alETH function, which executes the trade 1:1 ETH for alETH, sending the ETH to the transmuter. In doing so, it will boost yields in the same way that the DAI transmuter does.
Farms: Adept mode
Adept mode is the next evolution from mage -> sage -> adept
ALCX/ETH SLP
Sage 60%
Adept 58% (-2)
ALCX
Sage 20%
Adept 19% (-1)
alUSD3CRV LP
Sage 18%
Adept 18% (+0)
alUSD
Sage 2%
Adept 0% (-2)
alETH/ETH LP
Adept 5% (+5)
I propose we add 5% of weekly rewards to the alETH LP pool. Some quick calculations show that the alUSD-only pool at 2% attracts around $70m in liquidity. Normalized to 5%, that is $175m in expected liquidity. Assuming an ETH price of $4000, that would mean a pool worth 43,750 ETH, which would be roughly split between ETH and alETH. If only 2k alETH and 2k ETH can enter this pool without liquidations or direct trading for alETH to ETH (4k eth total), then yields for stakers would be considerably high. Such yields will attract more stakers into the curve pool until it normalizes along with much of the rest of DeFi yields. The end result is that there will be a tremendously beneficial ratio between Alchemix vault ETH deposits and transmuter ETH deposits, which will boost yield considerably for debt repayments.
We’d take some rewards from the Sushi and ALCX-only pools to fund the alETH/ETH pool, but only slightly so as to not disturb the stakers in the protocol and their expectations. The alUSD-only pool was only ever intended to be a limited pool, so cutting it altogether and redistributing it to the alETH/ETH pool seems reasonable now, especially considering the ~$600m of liquidity in the alUSD curve pool.
Final Note
This post is an open call for the community to comment on this launch plan for alETH. Input from the community is super important and we will take feedback seriously. Please indicate your sentiment of this plan and make suggestions for changes. Based on that feedback, I will create an AIP to send to snapshot to make the initial parameters of alETH official.
"
['Alchemix Request For Comment (ARC) #1'],Well balanced proposal. Approve. The long repayment times should definitely come down post the merge as ETH yields increase. This is going to be a great instrument.
['Alchemix Request For Comment (ARC) #1'],"Curious what is the justification for not favouring a long repayment time on vaults? Surely it’s a net positive for the protocol to lock up Eth for decades?
If anything, I see ethereum yield being far more viable long term than stables. When the bear hits, stable yields will likely crater, but ethereum yields have a floor associated with eth2 rewards."
['Alchemix Request For Comment (ARC) #1'],"Agree with atlas-ship's comment regarding bear market yields, with eth2 staking resulting in a 'floor' yield.
400% collateral ratio seems too conservative as a start IMO, it should be closer to the current DAI coll ratio to reduce mental gymnastics for new comers and to create a sort of new listing standard. E.g. I deposit X in alchemix, I get an un-liquidatable loan of 50% of the value, no matter the original asset.
As a side note i thinkcollateral ratio may not be an accurate term, since it is used widely in lending protocols, whose positions can be liquidated at a certain ratio. Alchemix is different and special, so something such as deposit ratio may be more accurate and friendly."
['Alchemix Request For Comment (ARC) #1'],"The worry with a lower collateralization ratio is that the transmuter won't get fed enough, and in the event of a peg destabilization event, the peg could recover quicker if the transmuter was seeing better flows. I'm still in favor of 400% to start, and then if the base yield and the transmuter boosted yield is good enough, we can turn it down to 200%.
It's MUCH easier to start conservative and then loosen up later than to start loose and then try to be more conservative later."
['Alchemix Request For Comment (ARC) #1'],"scoopy I understand the economics for maintaining liquidity for alUSD and alEth pairs will be a different ball game. The likelihood of peg destabilisation in alEth should be higher. Imo I think it's better to charge a higher yield fee, say 20% for eth vaults as a means for stabilisation, instead of increasing the deposit ratio. Ultimately, Alchemix doesn't want to discourage depositors. AUM is the bread and butter- locking eth for long periods is beneficial for ALCX holders"
['Alchemix Request For Comment (ARC) #1'],"I agree that the 400% is a bit restrictive. I also think that at that cap ratio it sorta punishing for those without fatter stacks of ETH. A few more considerations:
If this is something that could change quickly post launch then we're talking about eating another potentially high gas fee to get additional alETH. Not the end of the world but again sort of a tougher pill to swallow for smaller depositors.
  There's a potential tension between lowering the cap ratio and the alETH mint cap. If this is as popular as many thing it would be would we have to potentially increase the mint cap in order to lower the ratio?
Maybe we can split the baby here and consider 300%. Slightly less punishing to those with small stacks while not being overly ambitious given the lower ETH yields."
['Alchemix Request For Comment (ARC) #1'],"In my opinion, both keeping the peg and achieving a boosted APY are key features. That's what make Alchemix great and unique. A user can get their future yield in advance and also they receive more APY than yearn on their collateral thanks to the magic of the transmuter mechanism.
So I would also initially vote for a higher collateralise ratio than 200%, 400% seems fine, so we can feed the transmuter faster.
What I'm not sure is if a 5% weekly rewards will be enough to incentivise users to provide their ETH, so I would vote to go a bit higher, maybe 6% or 7%, and reduce it from the alUSD3CRV.
Either way, it would be great if both metrics (collateral ratio and pool rewards) can be easily updated afterwards."
['Alchemix Request For Comment (ARC) #1'],"msulc  great input from msulc, i'm in agreement with both comments. For the suggestion of the reward ratios, here's the outline with 1% less to the ALCX pool and 1% more to the alETH/ETH LP.
ALCX/ETH SLP
Sage 60%
Adept 58% (-2)
ALCX
Sage 20%
Adept 18% (-2)
alUSD3CRV LP
Sage 18%
Adept 18% (+0)
alUSD
Sage 2%
Adept 0% (-2)
alETH/ETH LP
Adept 6% (+)
Start here and adjust in the future as needed to increase liquidity."
['Alchemix Request For Comment (ARC) #1'],"Two thoughts:
400% is indeed a bit high.
We should take between 2 ~ 5% total from the ALCX single stake for the alETH/ETH LP. 1% feels too low. Providing LP is a far more useful service at the moment than single staking for rewards."
['Alchemix Request For Comment (ARC) #1'],"Thanks for putting the the proposal forward!
Vault Parameters: Collateral Ratio: 400%
I'm of two minds here
A longer term payoff is scary in crypto mostly because of how fast crypto can change. Locking up ETH for 15 years is hard to really wrap your mind around. (ETH isn't even that old!) 
But I think once the merge happens we'll see a ""risk free"" rate of 7% (Likely more since the tips will be going to stakers) and that would almost require other protocols to increase their yields above that threshold because otherwise it's not worth risking the ETH, that should reduce the repayment time quite a bit.
Limiting the risk initially I think is a good idea, but I think some kind of threshold for when the Collateral Ratio (Or Deposit ratio as @daveytea said) can get to parity with DIA is important. I also think that letting users see how long it's going to be until their loan is paid back would put that into their hands. Is the user ok with not having their ETH paid back until 2036? if so, that's probably ok. If not, they won't use it.
 alETH Debt Cap: 2000 alETH
This is great, I think this limit will be reached very quickly, but that's ok. Better safe than rekt. Again though if there was some set (hopefully publicly available) metrics that needed to be reached to increase this cap. (Time, Volumes, liquidity, etc)
Eth to alETH direct Purchases
Would it be possible to use the spare ETH in the Transmuter to put into the yvSTETH or yvSETH vault to juice the returns some? I know you mentioned that may introduce some slippage, but I think I'd agree with @squidgle that it'd be worth the extra dev work to allow users to take advantage of the increased yield
Farms
I think I'd be in favor of reducing the single sided ALCX by 5% and adding it to the alETH/ETH Pool as suggested by SathFenrir
"
['Alchemix Request For Comment (ARC) #1'],"My only concern with the long lockup period is that it may disincentivize people who want to park their ETH during the bear cycle.  If they feel that there's a chance the next bull rolls around while their position is still maturing, they may hesitate to deposit it at all.   My assumption here is that their goal is to avoid selling their ETH at all costs, so liquidating part of their collateral would be off limits for them."
['Alchemix Request For Comment (ARC) #1'],"Just curious, why use the yvETH vault instead of the crvSTETH vault? It would boost yields significantly and mitigate the leverage & paydown timing issues."
['Alchemix Request For Comment (ARC) #1'],"Pirateed the bookkeeping require for going to eth -> stethcrv LP to yvstETHCRV vault could affect users with slippage and would require a longer dev cycle to ensure it is safe. We were planning to go with stethcrv but the zaps to get in and out could make people incur losses too. Using the yvWETH vault means we can implement our current contracts with minimal changes.  So if we choose to go with stethcrv LP instead of eth, it means people would have to deposit stethcrv LP instead of eth, or we'd have to delay this a few weeks at least
"
['Alchemix Request For Comment (ARC) #1'],"scoopy i think the small effort up front to gain almost double the APY is worth it when you're talking years to get the return back.
even if that effort is put on the user to acquire the stethcrv themselves. zaps could come later?"
['Alchemix Request For Comment (ARC) #1'],"scoopy will v2 bring the ability to implement/deploy too multiple strategies as yearn v2 vaults do?
Re. Above discussion. 
As a long term hodler of ETH (in various forms) I would not be deterred by longer maturing periods. Ie. 200% vs. 400%. I would obviously prefer 200% over 400% as my goal for many years has simply been to accumulate more ETH, which this ratio would compliment. On this same note, a 200% ratio will imo, enable greater participation in the ETH:alETH pool.
To an earlier point, an ability to borrow 50% as a meme is powerful. Simplifies UX mental models and if an eta maturity date is prominent enough, should not impact adoption negatively, especially if it is known that rates will improve over time. "
['Alchemix Request For Comment (ARC) #1'],"scoopy it would be good if we could chooae the best ""flavour"" of ETH available (meaning the highest APY). It would be very attractive to newcomers"
['Alchemix Request For Comment (ARC) #1'],"scoopy
Data maxima venia
alETH v1 vault with 400% collateralization and low APY of 3-4% is a less-than-optimal product and I think we all know it.
If I deposited my ETH on any Alchemix vault today, I expect it to be on par with the best yields available on DeFi.
stETHcrv is rewarding 11,44% APY -- if we can't match that, no matter the collateralization settings debate, I don't think it's worth launching.
By Alchemix launching this iteration I don't see any angle that this would benefit the community, au contraire, I can see it only tarnishing it's pristine branding.
Consider that Alchemix is already a very hard to grasp concept for the average user. 
We (I mean you guys) are working very hard to educate users and present the benefits of utilizing ALCX vaults.
Even amidst all the confusion happening in normies and no-coiners minds, in my perspective, there are certain aspects about the actual v1 DAI vault that allure as crucial concepts of Alchemix (as a service provider), in simple terms:
user deposit X (100%) -> user can borrow X/2 (50%) upfront 
meanwhile, 100% of deposited amount is kept ""working"" in DeFi
loan pays itself as fast as DeFingly possible 
I think those are more than settings. To me they are fundamental characteristics and a piece of the branding concept of Alchemix. This is already being memefied amongst the web. I don't think we should give up on them in favor of shipping a v1 ETH vault fast.
In my view the launch of alETH with low APY and higher collateralization would only contribute to further confusion and unhappy users. Or even worse, the market could dislike it at large and label us as a flop, or a one-time product company.
If we decide to launch vaults with superior collateralizations and lower than best APY's, the end user will get further confused and letdown. 
This may be worth doing in certain cases, like with alBTC maybe. I don't think this is the case for alETH at all.
I would rather delay the launch and consider stETHcrv for higher APY or forget about it entirely and focus on V2 where we could chase better yields wherever they are. Last not forget that ETH has EIP-1559 and the merge are happening soon, and with this, ETH as an asset is expected to deliver much higher yields and those should be harnessed by our vaults.
Also, if the APY (on launch) of any vault is higher than 10%, I would not consider changing the collateralization ratio (would keep 200%). If the APY by any chance lowers after launch then the user can always self-liquidate to retrieve its principal.
Although I think it is prudent to keep alETH mintable ceiling low and increase it slowly (as it is already being proposed.)
TL;DR - postpone alETH vault in favor of higher APY chasing (with stETHcrv or wait for V2)"
['Alchemix Request For Comment (ARC) #1'],"I'm in favor of conservative 400%, but would suggest a higher % of ALCX weekly rewards at the start. alUSD rewards can certainly be removed, but a small reduction in the alUSD3CRV pool would be merited to for the early ETH depositors. 2-3% higher on ETH would really bootstrap the new pools"
['Alchemix Request For Comment (ARC) #1'],"400% is not ideal, but I agree it's better to start conservative and roll down once we see usage and understand the impact of doing so. Biggest callout is on the weights, because of the 2k cap, alETH/ETH would have a more favorable APY than other pools. I recommend the below, which still incentives capital into the new pool but makes alETH/ETH LPing closer in APY to SLP:
ALCX/ETH : 60% (0)
AlCX: 18% (-2)
alUSD: 0% (-2)
alETH/ETH: 4% (+4)
3crv: 18% (0)"
['Alchemix Request For Comment (ARC) #1'],"Thanks for the explanation Scoopy. Given it's an initial rollout, I'm supportive of the proposal. The cap is lower than I would have hoped for but can understand why. I see this as the product of the future to drive ALCX growth and want to ensure there's enough incentive here to pull people away from higher LTV debt projects. I'm not sure a 25% LTV + 5 year paydown schedule is enough but can recognize it's the first iteration.
"
['Alchemix Request For Comment (ARC) #1'],"Thanks for all your work scoopy. This is such an incredible tool.
Given the ease through which someone can use leverage to obtain a desired level of ETH price exposure, it seems to me that much of the demand for ETH collateralized borrowing might be generated by tax management strategies. Since borrowing through Alchemix offers the user the ability to liquidate as they see fit, I think it might make sense to prioritize the collateralization ratio over the expected debt repayment date.
I've know quite a few people (myself included) who are excited about the alETH development and are considering the following strategy:
Deposit ETH as collateral
Borrow 50%
Convert 50% of the borrowed collateral to USD / Convert 50% of borrowed collateral to ETH2x-FLI
Cash out USD 
This works at a 200% collateralization ratio but becomes increasingly less effective the higher the ratio goes.
Additionally, for those who are willing to accept a lower net ETH exposure, a higher collateralization ratio decreases the utility of borrowing through Alchemix. Since people would have to pay taxes on the income earned that is paying down their debt, the tax burden of larger and faster income (which at least in the US would be taxed at ordinary income rates, not capital gains) may get to a level where it outweighs the consequences of simply selling for USD.
My only other comment is that I can understand wanting to have less of the rewards allocated to the alUSD farm. That said, I would advocate for lowering, but not eliminating it. As people are still getting comfortable with what Alchemix has to offer, allowing newcomers or people with a lower risk tolerance to participate in the Farm with alUSD might help generate more confidence over time as well as keep more capital within the ecosystem.
Thanks again for all your effort."
['Alchemix Request For Comment (ARC) #1'],"I admire the conservative approach on more volatile asset could it become a standard for other large caps in the future? What is the concern for limiting the system’s alETH debt to not exceed 2000 alETH?
It seems some would prefer to ape into a 10 year debt, that they can forever extend, But that's so fiat. 
How do we incentivize 2-5 year loans and feed the transmuter to boost yields. 
Maybe giving the option for lower collateral ratio with a deposit fee of 2%.
Limited debt + boost yield = Alchemix is to me."

['[AIP-8] New Liquidity Pool Choice on Sushi Onsen'],"As written by @xycejnh :
Dear members of the Alchemix community,
Very recently we have been blessed with attention from various institutions. One of these is Sushi, with whom we have already been collaborating on the ALCX/ETH Liquidity Pool.
Sushi have given us some great news by letting us know that we will be integrated in their Onsen program. This means that community members who provide ALCX/ETH liquidity will receive additional Sushi rewards (specifically, 100 Onsen allocation points).
We have also been generously offered the allocation of an additional liquidity pool on Sushi. Relevant details are as follows:
The community will get to choose which tokens to represent in this pool.
Liquidity providers of this pool will only be rewarded with Sushi tokens (5 Onsen allocation points). No ALCX tokens will be rewarded for this pool.
Having more liquidity pools is very advantageous because it strengthens the alUSD peg and improves its accessibility.
I propose a vote for choosing which tokens to represent in this pool. Our current options are:
An alUSD/ETH pool,
An alUSD/DAI pool, or
No pool (we reject Sushi's offer of the extra pool)."
['[AIP-8] New Liquidity Pool Choice on Sushi Onsen'],"Amazing! I’d vote for the alUSD / DAI, as that helps keep the peg and would offer an additional venue for trading it (in addition to curve).
for the sushi rewards for alcx / eth- will those just show up in sushi, or is there something needed to be done? "
['[AIP-8] New Liquidity Pool Choice on Sushi Onsen'],alUSD/ETH sounds attractive... or maybe DAI/alETH in the future if we reject now.
['[AIP-8] New Liquidity Pool Choice on Sushi Onsen'],"Excellent news. I would be in support of either pool, with a preference for alUSD/ETH for a few reasons:
ETH is the base asset for a large number of pools on Sushiswap, making trades from alUSD to most ERC20s require the fewest hops and lower fees
The ALCX -> alUSD path would be simply routed through ETH, enabling easier compounding for the LPs in the alUSD-3crv pool
There is already a route from alUSD <-> DAI via the above curve pool, and an xyk curve is not ideal for two stable assets.
Still, I would support proposals for either pool. "
['[AIP-8] New Liquidity Pool Choice on Sushi Onsen'],"I'm in support of alUSD/ETH pool. Main reasons:
ETH/Stable pools are the one with the biggest dept across DEXes and offers lower IL (excluding stablepools)
Lower fees, less hoopes
After we get this pool and liquidity going we can discuss and add more pools that are mentioned"
['[AIP-8] New Liquidity Pool Choice on Sushi Onsen'],"So many exciting developments recently. Between the two pool options mentioned (alusd/eth, alusd/dai), are there likely differences in how they might affect the alusd peg?
My thought is that alusd/eth is more convenient, as eth is often the intermediary. Also we already have a alusd/dai option when using the crv pool.
But I'm not clear if alusd/eth might create some pressure on the peg in ways that wouldn't be so with alusd/dai."
['[AIP-8] New Liquidity Pool Choice on Sushi Onsen'],"I would rather see an ETH/alUSD pool for the following reasons:
By creating a market for alUSD against ETH we are covering all the bases since every asset on Ethereum has a liquid market against either ETH or one of the big stables. It would reduce friction for smaller players and make alUSD more useful by requiring one less (gas intensive) hop if you want to speculate with your loan since you'll always be able to trade to that asset with the least necessary amount of hops.
I would rather concentrate all alUSD liquidity with DAI to the CRV pool to strengthen the peg and prevent slippage, than potentially fragment liquidity between two pools even if it's to a small degree. Additionally a potential alUSD/DAI sushi pool would probably net a much smaller APR than the CRV pool, so I would imagine high slippage on that pair and not a lot of utility
An alUSD/ETH pool actually creates a new type of LP offering we don't currently provide in the Alchemix ecosystem, allowing more optionality on the spectrum of how much exposure people want to speculative crypto assets while LPing for rewards. It offers less speculative price exposure than the ALCX/ETH pool, since one side of the pool is in a stable, and more speculative price exposure than the CRV pool, since the other side of the pool is ETH. The potential alUSD/DAI pool offers nothing new"
['[AIP-8] New Liquidity Pool Choice on Sushi Onsen'],Awesome news! I would love to see an alUSD/ETH pool added. Alchemix is making tons of moves -- love to see it
['[AIP-8] New Liquidity Pool Choice on Sushi Onsen'],"After reading other’s posts and thinking more in it, I’m more in favor of the alUSD/eth pool (although I like both). The curve alUSD/dai pool is sufficient and this would provide a lot more exposure to alUSD, since dex tx’s are denominated in eth (as others pointed out). "
['[AIP-8] New Liquidity Pool Choice on Sushi Onsen'],"I also vote alUSD/ETH. I actually harassed JiroOno about it. My case is similar to others. An alUSD/ETH pair makes alUSD more ""real"" as a stable coin. If you can tell people yeah, just mint alUSD and go buy ETH they get it. Sending small to mid size user to the CRV pool now kinda hurts since it is a gas intensive transaction to get DAI. it will also open more paths to other assets using aggregators. Exciting news!"
['[AIP-8] New Liquidity Pool Choice on Sushi Onsen'],Echoing others' sentiments in here but I'm in favor of an alUSD/ETH pool since Curve has been sufficient for alUSD/DAI up to this point.
['[AIP-8] New Liquidity Pool Choice on Sushi Onsen'],"Echoing much of what many here have said, particularly @ButlerAndTheThirdStringers, I believe the addition of an alUSD/ETH pool would be a monumental milestone for the Alchemix network and community.
Without repeating anything that's already been said, I believe that Alchemix has the potential to grow exponentially with the addition of important pools like alUSD/ETH (and other big milestones right around the corner). With sustainable scaling in mind, I'd say this decision is a clear positive as it brings so much more utility to alUSD (and keeps stability, by concentrating existing liquidity on CRV pool) as well as a low-hop way for users to get exposure to this growing ecosystem.
Great to see this conversation happening, and looking forward to supporting this addition! "
['[AIP-8] New Liquidity Pool Choice on Sushi Onsen'],"Like the others above me have already said, alUSD/ETH makes the most sense. The go to way to trade alUSD/stable is Curve and thus creating another stable/stable pool becomes redundant imo. "
['[AIP-8] New Liquidity Pool Choice on Sushi Onsen'],alUSD/ETH definitely has the strongest arguments. Agree with alUSD/ETH.
['[AIP-8] New Liquidity Pool Choice on Sushi Onsen'],"What  I like about a  stable/stable pool is that it's easier  to swap alUSD to Dai now without using  Curve, which is  fairly gas intensive. Additionally it might be better for keeping the peg."
['[AIP-8] New Liquidity Pool Choice on Sushi Onsen'],I also like alUSD/ETH pair because everything in the space is around ETH and a better peg to stablecoin. It is going to be a great help for Alchemix
['[AIP-8] New Liquidity Pool Choice on Sushi Onsen'],"I think overall the alUSD/ETH pool offers more utility and room for growth.  The only think that makes me think an alUSD/DAI might be worth it is the fact Uniswap v3 stuff will directly compete with Curve's stable coin algorithm.  If curve was to get beaten out we would lose our only stablecoin pool.  I know this is a worse case type thing but thought I would bring it up for discussion. What are your thoughts?
ETH-alUSD is likely to attract more liquidity and make the trade between alUSD to ALCX much more efficient.
alUSD-DAI will probably have low liquidity (because Curve is vastly superior and better yield returns with ALCX + Curve tokens). Remember that this “extra” sushi pool will not receive ALCX rewards, only Sushi (and a small amount at that). But this pool would greatly help the Oracle problems where everyone keeps asking why alUSD is breaking the peg (because CoinMarketCap and Coingecko only point to Uniswap or Sushiswap). Lots of other DeFi projects would use alUSD but the Oracle problem hurts them as well.
These are some of the thoughts I've gathered from friends and colleagues about it. Thought I would repost here as well.
"
['[AIP-8] New Liquidity Pool Choice on Sushi Onsen'],I agree with what many have said. alUSD/ETH pool is the move here. It makes it much easier and more gas efficient for users to directly yunt into their favorite shitcoins with their loan. It also increases the usability and attractiveness of alUSD as stablecoin which is key for the future.
['[AIP-8] New Liquidity Pool Choice on Sushi Onsen'],"Slight concern about Impermanent Loss with an alUSD/ETH pool, but ultimately in favor of either new pool"
['[AIP-8] New Liquidity Pool Choice on Sushi Onsen'],alUSD/ETH sounds most sensible. Gets my vote too.

['Update Transmuter Page'],"The boosted yield Alchemix offers users is a vital aspect that makes it stand out above other protocols and I believe the Transmuter page should be updated to make this more clear to users. According to the velocity-app transmuter TVL page (https://velocity-app.flipsidecrypto.com/dashboard/alchemix-transmuter-b-tvl-s8bnHU) the amount in the transmuter has decreased from its ATH of $268M-$269M during May 9-13 to roughly half that at the current level of $132M which has a significant impact on APY.
The current text:
""Depositing your alUSD will gradually convert it into DAI over time.
Or you can swap alUSD for DAI, USDC, or USDT on Curve now.""
makes it seem that transmuter should be the first option for users, and the curve pool is secondary. I believe the text should be switched to something that not only puts the curve pool first, but also informs the user that by using the transmuter they are also decreasing the yields every user (their self included) is earning. "
['Update Transmuter Page'],"Franky I couldn't agree more with this proposal. I've seen a ton of confusion among new users over the past couple of weeks. Some are using it as the primary mechanism for converting alUSD to DAI, and others are misunderstanding it thinking that staking in the Transmuter will provide them yield like the farms do. We definitely need to provide some clarity on what it is and when to use it.
For the consideration of the devs and community, here are some suggestions that I think might help:
Add a sentence in the beginning of the current description that says ""The Transmuter is a mechanism for maintaining the alUSD dollar peg, and can be use to redeem alUSD for DAI at a rate of 1 to 1 in the event that alUSD is trading under 1 dollar in the broader market.""
Make it more clear that the bolded word Curve in the description is a hyperlink. Some users have been confused as to where they may go to trade their alUSD for DAI in the broader market. Perhaps we could add an explicit https:// or the .to at the end, or an underline, or cause it to turn blue on hover.
Change the words ""stake"" and ""unstake"" on the buttons to ""Deposit"" and ""Withdraw"", since feedback from new users suggests that the word ""stake"" implies earning income by locking funds.
Remove the ""Yearly Transmutation Rate"" at the bottom. I'm actually not entirely sure what this percentage represents, but I could see how this text next to a percentage of 100,000+ could be misinterpreted by newer users as a APR you might earn by using the Transmuter
Add a confirmation popup when the user clicks the ""stake"" button that says something along the lines of ""Warning: converting alUSD to DAI using the Transmuter has the side effect of reducing repayment rate for borrowers accross the Alchemix protocol. This should only be done if the price of alUSD is trading under 1 dollar."""
['Update Transmuter Page'],ButlerAndTheThirdStringers These are great suggestions. 
['Update Transmuter Page'],"I agree with this. This is one of those ""known"" bugs that has been talked about for a long time. Evidence of it possibly having a major effect on TVL is enough reason for me to want to act."
['Update Transmuter Page'],"Strong agree with this.
""You can swap your alUSD for Dai, USDC, or USDT on Curve instantly.
If alUSD is below the peg on Curve, you can alternatively use the transmuter. This will slowly convert your alUSD into DAI over time at a perfect 1:1.
The transmuter does not provide any yield. For alUSD farming opportunities, please visit the farm tab.
Something like this. Simple and effective direction for new users.
I'd also consider switching around the farm and transmute tabs on the main menu. After using the vault, users who are exploring will click the transmute tab first, because it's next on the menu. Make the farm tab come first.
Very simple to change to guide new users into where you would prefer them to go."
['Update Transmuter Page'],"These are all good points. Always on board with spelling out protocol functions and when they're most appropriate to use. DeFi is coming to broader audiences, definitely worth considering making UI elements more informative/hand holdy."
['Update Transmuter Page'],"Agree with this. I have noticed this question asked by new people in the discord. One thing to keep i mind is that many new users to any protocol will naturally assume that doing something from within the protocol will be better than going to yet another dapp.
Clarifying this process might help new users better understand that the curve swap is their friend. And perhaps alusd/eth soon!"
['Update Transmuter Page'],"Very good proposal. 
Great points all round. 
Only additional comment I’d add is to recommend the alUSD rate be shown. If the rate is above a dollar, it highlight a loss if the transmutor is used. "
['Update Transmuter Page'],"Valid points. While we're currently revamping the UI for V2 to be much clearer what goes on when you click things and what people can expect, there's obviously a need to at least change some of the wording on V1 to avoid confusion with new users."

['The incentive of end users in Alchemix'],"There's no ""one size fits all"" kinda thing in defi. If you think you can get better returns using a different strategy than go for it.
That said: if you put your 1000 DAI into Alchemix and get a 500 alUSD loan, once your debt is paid off automatically by Alchemix you'll have 1000 DAI and 500 alUSD plus whatever staking rewards you got for it, whereas in your curve example you'd have your 500 DAI plus staking rewards and your other 500 DAI that are elsewhere.
Math out whatever works for you and be sure to fully understand the systems and risks you're planning on dropping your money into."

['[AIP-7] Token Grant to Tier-1 Exchange'],"Putting this here as a reference because Snapshot doesn't let me sign long messages. There was healthy debate in the discord prior to snapshot, and the text here is what I wanted to put in snapshot but was unable.
..............
$ALCX is being considered for listing on a tier-1 exchange. This is mainly contingent on Alchemix DAO offering a token grant of ALCX for this exchange. While securing this grant does not absolutely guarantee a listing, it will greatly increase our chances. This is different from a listing fee, as the ALCX granted to the exchange will be rewarded to ALCX depositors on this exchange. This grant is not going to the exchange, but rather to the users of it. So, in effect, it is more of a temporary rewards program to get liquidity onto this exchange so we can have a stronger presence on CEXs.
The more people that take their ALCX onto this exchange, the greater your share of the farming pools should be too, so the temporary increase in emissions will benefit current stakers.
Another benefit of this is increasing awareness and access to $ALCX to a broader community. Growing our community and increasing the diversity of our token holders is paramount for the long term health of Alchemix.
Furthermore, as we are working with Chainlink to create secure price feeds for our assets, getting on an additional tier-1 exchange will allow them to have more data points for their oracles, ensuring more accurate and less manipulable price feeds.
Currently the DAO treasury holds 430k ALCX tokens, and 1000 tokens of that is 0.2% of the total supply the DAO holds. In Scoopy's opinion, this is a small price to pay for the potential upside.
The options are:
0 ALCX tokens granted to this exchange

['[AIP-6] Proposal to Increase Debt Ceiling'],"Hi all,
We continue to deplete the Global Mintable alUSD in between harvests.
Total TVL has risen 40% since the start of May.
In discussion with other community members we hypothesize that demand for minting alUSD will spike once we achieve audit as well as launching of ETH/alETH. We believe that users will likely deposit ETH, mint alETH, convert to DAI, deposit DAI and mint alUSD to safe ape into other things.
Determining a conservative debt limit increase may prove difficult as we cannot predict what the growth might look like. But I believe a 20% bump in the debt ceiling will suffice in the short term.
When I have more time available I will try to dive into the numbers more to provide a better breakdown, but I wanted to get the conversation started at least.
Thanks!"
['[AIP-6] Proposal to Increase Debt Ceiling'],"I am largely in favor of this but I have one concern. I am proposing to cut the alUSD only pool altogether with the launch of alETH/ETH LP farms. There is like 60m alUSD in that pool currently, and the curve pool has a slightly heavy alUSD ratio in comparison to the 3CRV tokens in it. If that 60m were to enter single sided into the curve pool alongside an additional 20m freshly minted alUSD, it could lead to some pegging issues. With these factors in mind, I think an increase of 5m alUSD debt would be a good testing ground to see its effects alongside the destruction of the alUSD only pool. If the peg holds up well, then it will be safe to expand the cap more. "
['[AIP-6] Proposal to Increase Debt Ceiling'],"Here is a copy-paste of my thoughts regarding this issue from the discord, feel free to pass this part if you follow it:
The current debt ceiling likely did not account for the delay of the audit.
The app is in a very early stage and it is important for us to keep the momentum of growth by letting newcomers use the app as intended.
Since contract interactions are rather limited in V1, increasing the debt ceiling does not necessarily bring much risk.
The introduction of ETH/alETH to the app will likely bring even more attention and capital to the app within the DeFi space, therefore a relatively larger increase is justified.
To conclude, I believe we don't have much to lose by increasing the globally mintable alUSD amount. Conversely, we have a lot to lose by missing out on users who can not reliably use the app.
My current inclination after reading the discussion here so far:
Protecting the alUSD-DAI peg is probably as important as not turning away new people is. However, there are existing security mechanisms with that already provide protection for the peg. One of these is the transmuter, another is the slippage/bonus mechanism inside the alUSD-3CRV-f pool. Additionally, perhaps other ways can be devised to incentivize people to be beneficial to the system, such as increasing the rewards in the alUSD-3CRV-f pool.
I would support a relatively small increase like scoopy suggested, only if care is taken to act quickly, in order not to have another debt ceiling in a week (i.e. increasing it in small increments again if need be). Similarly, action must be taken to remove the alUSD pool as soon as possible; because our userbase is only going to grow further, presumably even at an exponential rate. Thus, the risk of another debt ceiling is higher with passing time."
['[AIP-6] Proposal to Increase Debt Ceiling'],"Both the peg and the availability for new people to use the protocol are essential. I think we should raise the limit but I really don't like Scoopy's flagged concern. The peg must be protected. Right now all people use alUSD for is to either stake in the transmuter or run the CRV pool to exchange back to DAI. ok, or LP. If we want to protect the peg more robustly I have a couple of ideas.
Numero uno, weekly transmuter buyback. Use a small % of the transmuter yield to buy back alUSD from the market/CRV pool each week. This could be only a few %. This helps pull some of the alusd out of circulation and close the loop. I would picture it as a once a week thing so it isn't a huge chore or gas expense. It may be pointless, but I figured I'd throw it out there.
Idea 2, alUSD/ETH Sushi pool. See if they can give us Onsen for it or something. I feel like a lot of people borrow and then ask what they do with alUSD. We always direct them to the CRV pool but this keeps putting pressure on the peg it looks like. If we can say, you can exchange it for ETH at Sushi I feel like it will be a good thing especially for the small/mid users. The CRV pool eats a lot of gas and now you have DAI which you want to swap anyway. This also starts to help get alUSD out in the wild more. It might be a more visible arbitrage than CRV vs the transmuter as well. If we can't get Onsen maybe we can ask capital partners to seed a pool. Seems like it would be a low risk way for them to help their investment. I'll poke around in the sushi discord and see if I can drum up support in the mean time.
I understand this may be less of an issue after V2, but these are my thoughts in the mean time .

Over time, as your alUSD debt is paid down, which means you can withdraw the DAI amount that was backing the alUSD amount that was paid down.  Or you can borrow more alUSD.  So for example, if you stake 1000 DAI, and borrow 500 alUSD, then over time the 500 alUSD debt is paid down to 400 alUSD, you now only need 800 DAI to collateralize the remaining 400 alUSD loan.  So you can either withdraw 200 DAI or borrow 100 more alUSD."
['Principal and repayment question'],"asymrisk I would like to take this interest idea a little further.  Say I deposit 1000 Dai and borrow 500 alUSD.  The Dai APY is 50%.  From the loan calculator, it says the loan should be paid off in full after exactly 1 year.  But from I'm hearing, it looks like the deposit after 1 year would still be 1000 Dai, the amount I can withdraw is 500 Dai and the amount I can borrow is 250 alUSD.  What would be the amount on the balance of the loan?  If it's non-zero, how is it that the loan is paid off in full?"
['Principal and repayment question'],"jbisson9 in your example, once the loan was paid off after that 1 year, you can either take up another 500 alUSD loan or withdraw your 1000 DAI or leave the DAI where they are and earn an increase in your alUSD borrow limit which won't count as debt if you decide to take it."

For the time being I'd just rather accumulate alUSD with my vault deposit before deciding to jump in head first and invest more to justify the gas fees. Really appreciate the help of all of you 🙂"
['Tiny fish in a pond'],"This is precisely how it works. If you deposit $1000 DAI, you'll notice your available alUSD is 500, over time as the yearn vaults are harvested you'll notice your available alUSD borrowable balance increase. These tokens can be ""borrowed"" without incurring debt. So if your alUSD balance becomes 510 alUSD, you could transmute that 10 alUSD for DAI 1:1 or swap it on the market (like CRV) for nearly 1:1."

['Clarification - Advance origin'],"Hi Guys,
Love this project, very excited for it and very keen to see the audit come through shortly.
I am just wondering if someone wouldn't mind help clarify for me where the advance on the yield comes from? As I'm having a little bit of difficulty understanding it.
I understand that you deposit your DAI as collateral, and that goes off to earn a yield. But when you borrow alUSD against it, where does that alUSD come from? Is that simply a freshly minted token because you have your collateral locked?
And if that is the case, when you take that alUSD and swap for DAI, where is that DAI coming from?
Sorry if this is a complete n00b question. I've been around crypto for a while but DEFI has never been my strong point. Just trying to get a better understanding.
Thanks!"
['Clarification - Advance origin'],"Is that simply a freshly minted token because you have your collateral locked?
Yes.
And if that is the case, when you take that alUSD and swap for DAI, where is that DAI coming from?
Depends on where you swap. When you stake your alUSD in the transmuter, the DAI comes from a cut from the yield farming Alchemix does. If you swap it at other places like Sushiswap, the DAI was provided by someone else as liquidity.

Ability to insure our funds locked in the vault. If I recall correctly, the ydai vault had been hacked in the past, so I was thinking wouldn't it be great if Alchemix partnered with someone like Nexus Mutual so user can opt-in to ensure the funds are safu. I think Nexus mutual yearly cost is 2.60% and the current ydai vault generates around 20% apy, I'm sure some users are willing to offset the 2.60% from ydai vault to protect their funds. 
More yearn strategies for stablecoins which can yield even more APY (3crv, mUSD, USDC, USDT)  allow user to choose and change the vault any time. Community can vote to include which strategies to bring to Alchemix
Integrating Compound and AAVE (or other any bluechip lending protocol). My reasoning behind this is what happens when all of a sudden Yearn APY reduces drastically and goes to shitter? Wouldn't it to be cool if user can transfer their funds to other protocol like Compound or AAVE and make Alchemix more Flexibl
L2 wen?
Thoughts? "
"['Earned alUSD has not increased in 24 hours, looking for a resource to learn why']",We harvest roughly once every 24 hours. Sometimes we have to wait until yearn harvests before we can.
['Streamline Alchemix use'],"I think we have some unnecessary friction in using Alchemix.
I think there are two primary areas that could be streamlined for the user.
Deposits - Allow users to ""Zap"" from X token to DIA as part of the deposit contract.
Withdraws - Allow users to ""Zap"" from alUSD to X token (provided X token is in the Curve pool)
The majority of users will interact with Alchemix at these two points, and I think there's a benefit to making it as seamless as possible.
That's the TLDR^
To streamline the deposits I think we could copy the ""zap"" feature from Zapper.fi that Yearn has. If a user comes to Alchemix without DAI (or any of the future deposit tokens) they could select which deposit from their wallet they wanted to use to convert to a token that Alchemix accepts, and would then deposit into Alchemix. This give the users more optionality for their deposits, and makes a user more likely to deposit.
EG: User has USDC and wants to deposit to Alchemix, user clicks the deposit box, selects USDC, and then alchemix swaps USDC to DIA, and deposits
Regarding withdraws, I think it'd be a nice feature if we could allow the user to select which stable coin they wanted to have after going through the transmuter.
EG: If user selected USDC, after the user took their loan the contract would automatically convert the alUSD into USDC from the Curve pool. This would prevent the user from having to navigate out to curve, and then swap from alUSD themselves.
Bonus Points:
Have an option where users can deposit and withdraw their desired coin all in one transaction (Bundle the Zap, deposit, withdraw and swap to desired Coin)
This would reduce the number of approvals needed, and greatly increase the user experience.
Risks
Deposit - I don't think there's a large risk here
Withdraw - I think there could be a risk of adding sell pressure to alUSD that may cause it to lose it's peg. But I don't think that pressure doesn't already exist as there are not as many uses for alUSD outside of Alchemix (yet)
"

['Nexus mutual'],Hi!  Do you use nexus mutual or any form of insurance on your dai deposits in yearn vaults?  It seems they have coverage available.  I would like my deposits through alchemix to be covered and I would be willing to pay to insure it myself or receive less in interest but I am not sure if that’s possible.  I believe the insurance would need to be carried by alchemix since they are the ones actually depositing the dai in yearn vaults
['Nexus mutual'],I think I've read that most of the insurance providers currently have limits to their coverage so they wouldn't be able to cover such a large holding. Potentially something could be worked out between Alchemix and one of the providers more directly though.  I'd have to see what type of cost that would be before saying it would be good or bad to do.  We should be looking for ways to insure though.

['[AIP-2] Transmuter Farming'],"Yo ALCX fam. I’m not sure how much the team has discussed the idea of using some of the transmuter DAI for farming, but I had an idea that I think could be both safe and capital efficient. I understand in the short term this might not be possible with the current transmuter, but I think working through ideas on how this could work might give the team insight moving forward on how to best proceed. I also know nothing about coding, so the technical aspect is lost on me. I believe State has come up with a nifty idea on how unwinding the transmuter to do something like this might be possible as well.
Right now, we have over $110 million in the transmuter, which is great for safety, the peg, and having a strong backstop, yet that’s a lot of money to have sitting idle for the entirety of the protocol. As I understand, this $112 million is backed 1:1 to DAI as it was liquidated from DAI to alUSD. If we were to use some of this DAI—I propose [(amount in vault)*0.45] aka 45% the amount in yearns vault—we would be able to use around $30 mil of DAI in the transmuter for farming. This number allows alUSD to continue to be overcollateralized, as the vault is 2:1 DAI to alUSD, covering for the now .55:1 DAI to alUSD in the transmuter—overall making the peg 1.05:1 in house. Even if the worst were to happen and we lost all the DAI put to farming, we would still have a greater than 1:1 peg for alUSD, ensuring safety for our users.
As the amount of DAI in the transmuter and vaults increases, I would propose repeating this formula for every $50mil DAI added. In terms of farming, for maximum safety, a protocol like AAVE or the likes would work best (I would suggest COMP as well, but I know they have oracle issues). This would diversify us away from Yearn, avoiding being overexposed to their vaults, while still having this important capital in a safe yet strong yield earning protocol.
Alchemix might consider dividing up the earnings of this farming in two ways:
50% to the DAO for Devs/contributors salaries, bug bounties, etc. Personally, I like the idea of using this for salaries. These earnings would provide staff a stablecoin salary to additionally reward and incentivize top talent. This type of salary would also be easy for our devs/contributors to use without having to worry about selling ALCX and creating FUD. Our devs have created a protocol with $500mil TVL in less than two weeks. They shouldn’t have to choose between selling their ALCX and working a day job. This wouldn’t have to be all or even most of their salaries but earnings kept in DAI for this purpose. Long term, this strategy would create a sustainable path for paying devs and contributors that stays competitive by naturally increasing with Alchemix’s growth.
50% to buy back ALCX to add to the treasury. This would both increase the treasury size and add a deflationary aspect to the token without reducing user’s rewards for farming, increasing the price and scarcity of the token in the long run.
I consider this to be pretty risk-averse overall, but I’m interested to hear other’s thoughts on this are. Shout out to State for working through these ideas with me.

['[AIP-2] Transmuter Farming'],I'm ready to vote yes to this
['[AIP-2] Transmuter Farming'],This is exciting. What if they used the transmute like shares in a company people could buy shares. Our pension plans. Maybe for some of the older crypto degens that are looking for a more safe play. Or or take a portion out and use it like a war chest and hit some farms up and straight buy up crops. The consensus would just need to be simple and fast moving. Or use the war chest like a giant arbitrage  war chest machine. This could help pensioners/share holders in the DAOC decentralized automonus company. A fluid mega crypto company. If anyone wants talk about this that would be cool
['[AIP-2] Transmuter Farming'],"I'm a big supporter of this. There is some prior art we can lean on. Aave and Balancer have a partnership now where a percentage of the Balancer vault goes into Aave. They only keep enough to handle active trades, but the rest of the deeper swap liquidity is earning yeild. The percentage of how much to do this with can start off really conservative and get tweaked over time.
For the buy back I am a big supporter of the keep it instead of burn it model. If ALCX is mostly used for rewarding farmers right now, then it can keep doing that. The more revenue, the more ALCX that is available for on going rewards. Rinse repeat. Gov can vote on other uses as well.
And lastly salaries, 100%. This open source software is cool because its is open source software with revenue and resources and budget. So pay the team. Yield payments are nice, but I also want to point out there should be nothing wrong with the team getting rewarded in big piles of ALCX. I hope that's true and fud isnt as large an issue as people currently fear. I like doing both, most startups you earn both salary and equity.

Not really much I don't agree with in there, only thing is maybe about farmed percentages allocation. Salaries come down to future alcx prices which we cant know ahead of time. Obviously with an inflated alcx price , alchemist could afford heaps of talent with the 20% dev mint. I like the idea of devs collecting a dai salary for the idea of less uneccesary downward pressure on alcx and devs not needing to pick between keeping their own tokens or getting paid.

['[AIP-2] Transmuter Farming'],Support the general idea 100%. Also agree with Travis that there should be nothing wrong with also paying the team in ALCX.

One is the farming of Transmuter Dai, and then sending all the revenue to the DAO Treasury. In addition discussion around other Transmuter upgrades. There is a Lot to talk about regarding this and how the farming is implemented and deserves its own working group
Second is any Buy Back program for ALCX using treasury funds. This also has a lot of implementation details that can easily need its own space. 

And these two ideas don't need to launch together either, which is more reason to handle them seperately."
['[AIP-2] Transmuter Farming'],"Also I think upgrading the transmuter would be a great opportunity to include other upgrades to the transmuter:
For example, around peg-protection of alUSD: 
-emergency mode: a mode the team can trigger if there is some type of emergency that allows for ordely distribution of the DAI in transmuter if there ever was an event that made alUSD backed by less than 1 DAI. 
-rate-limitation : max amount of DAI exchanged out of the transmuter per day
Paired together, this assures there can't be a run on the bank of the DAI in transmuter by arbitrageurs if there ever was a peg-breaking event."
['[AIP-2] Transmuter Farming'],"In general I like this proposal but it’s not without risk. For one thing, this doesn’t guarantee a liquid alUSD-DAI transmuter. If a large quantity of people mint alUSD then all of a sudden the ratio becomes less than 1:1. This would ordinarily not be a problem since we can just withdraw from whatever source of yield we’re using, but it becomes a problem if the transmuter excess is lost due to a hack or some exploit found in the source of yield.
To remedy this, why not change the buy back mechanism to a dividend for ALCX holders. ALCX holders could serve as lenders of first resort, earning a portion the yield  that transmuter excess earns. In the case of the yield source losing funds, staked ALCX could be sold to cover the deficit. This would also allow us to earn more yield since we could safely go under the 1:1 ratio in the transmuter  and always have a backstop.  I do like the idea of using transmuter yield in part to fund dev salaries, but I don’t think we need to use all of the yield for this purpose "
['[AIP-2] Transmuter Farming'],"ButlerAndTheThirdStringers While ALCX bought back could also serve as a backstop, it would provide a downside risk to holding ALCX without any upside.

['[AIP-4] Redirect All Emissions on the alUSD Staking Pool to the 3CRV Pool'],"In AIP-3 we changed the weekly ALCX staking rewards to better serve the Alchemix Protocol (https://snapshot.org/#/alchemixstakers.eth/proposal/QmedGhedXebdpTbgw67R9A2xSmY2SuJh8swu6sFCsGbTd7) and by all accounts it was a resounding success. The additional emissions towards the ALCX-ETH pool have increased the liquidity of ALCX against ETH which is key for any protocol since ETH is the base asset in the Ethereum ecosystem, and the ALCX-only emissions have helped to curb sell pressure as a result of emissions. Interestingly enough, the most valuable pool may have proven to be the alUSD3CRV pool, for the following reasons:
Creating a stable market of alUSD against the three most popular stable coins helps the peg, which prevents the need for users to redeem using the transmuter, which means more funds for the treasury and more funds to boost actual borrower APY when the transmuter is upgraded in v2
A high APY on alUSD incentivizes borrowing, which increases transmuter TVL and as a result protocol earnings for the treasury and borrowers. Additionally, with a high alUSD APY, users who want to earn on stables are incentivized to liquidate in order to convert nearly all of their collateral to alUSD, which also increases transmuter funds for the aformentioned benefits.
The only pool that has not proven to not be as useful is the single alUSD pool. Although this may help stakers earn APY on alUSD, it does not come with the other benefits of the alUSD3CRV pool, namely creating a more liquid market for alUSD against other stables, and increasing reliability of the alUSD in the broader Ethereum ecosystem. Additionally, the much larger allocation of emissions towards the 3CRV pool as a result of the above snapshot has resulted in a higher APY earned on the 3CRV pool than the single alUSD pool, even with roughly 100m more in TVL in the 3CRV pool. This has effectively rendered the alUSD only pool useless to stakers, and to the protocol. (references below, courtesy of @0xdef1 and vfat)

My proposal is that we redirect all of the 2% emissions on the alUSD only pool to the alUSD3CRV pool. This incentivizes more borrowing and enhances the benefits listed above that we've already seen materialize as a result of directing a greater percentage of emissions to the 3CRV pool in AIP-3. @scoopy has indicated that deleting a pool, or reducing emissions to 0, is not practical from a coding standpoint, but we can reduce it to something negligible like .00000001%.
Thoughts?"
['[AIP-4] Redirect All Emissions on the alUSD Staking Pool to the 3CRV Pool'],"I guess my only hangup, is that the alUSD pool does give an additional option to people using the vault to mint alUSD.  While it may not be the most efficient use of alUSD or the 2% of ALCX emissions, I do see the value in keeping the alUSD pool especially for small stakers who are concerned about transaction fees.
At the very least, until other uses for alUSD come online."

Right now stackers in alUSD benefits from a 65% APR vs 67% for alUSD3CRV, so they are getting about the same APR but at a much lesser risk and no utility.  alUSD3CRV stackers do have an intrinsic risk with having assets in a stable pool.. i.e. if any assets drop (DAI, USDC, USDT, alUSD) (weakest asset) the stackers will suffer.

We could further reduce this in another adjustment to closer to zero, but I think doing it all at once would be more disruptive that it needs to be. Also wouldn't mind a slight adjustment away from the ALCX only pool and into 3crv to incentivise more minting of alUSD because a lot of the ALCX only stakers are pulling liq and dumping. docking their APY by 10-20% wouldn't be a terrible thing.

As Butler mentions, if they happen to self-liquidate like true degens to ape harder into those higher rewards, then that will help both the 3CRV pool get more liquidity and the transmuter for farming. I don't think the ALCX only pool pay cut will do any real damage. It's healthier to incentivize that 3CRV pool at this point. "
['[AIP-4] Redirect All Emissions on the alUSD Staking Pool to the 3CRV Pool'],scoopy Happy to get your feedback on this. Yes it makes sense. Although I'm staking ALCX I'd rather lower the APY to prevent farm and dump and incentivize the 3crv pool instead.
['[AIP-4] Redirect All Emissions on the alUSD Staking Pool to the 3CRV Pool'],scoopy I support scoopy's proposal and would even be in favor of cutting the ALCX only pool rewards even further (possibly even to 10% and splitting the cut amount 50/50 to go to the SLP and CRV pools?). I think that funneling as much liquidity to the LP pools as possible is ultimately what is best for the protocol and is the best way to incentivize long term investment.

Maintaining the best yield on a stable benefits the protocol a lot and that should be the priority. A bump from 18% -> 20.5% is a decent raise and I think it would go a long way in incentivizing minting of alUSD. Some math to see just how much of a bump that would be, using this week as an example:
Total ALCX Emissions This Week:
347.63 (alUSD-only) + 3476.26 (ALCX-only) + 10428.79 (SLP) + 3128.64 (3CRV) = 17381.32 ALCX
Hypothetical ALCX Emissions to 3CRV This Week: (based on a 20.5% share)
17381.32 * .205 = ~ 3563 ALCX (increase of ~ 434 ALCX this week)
Current ALCX earned this week per 1 dollar staked in 3CRV:
(~ 3129 alcx per week / ~ 339,803,637 dollars staked) * 1380 dollars per alcx = ~ $.0127 per week per 1 dollar staked
$.0127 * 10,000 = ~ $127 earned this week per 10k staked
$.0127 * 50,000 = ~ $635 earned this week per 50k staked
$.0127 * 100,000 = ~ $1270 earned this week per 100k staked
Hypothetical ALCX earned this week per 1 dollar staked in 3CRV:
(~ 3563 alcx per week / ~ $339,803,637 tvl) * $1380 dollars per alcx = ~ $.0145 per week per 1 dollar staked
$.0145 * 10,000 = ~ $145 earned this week per 10k staked
$.0145 * 50,000 = ~ $725 earned this week per 50k staked
$.0145 * 100,000 = ~ $1450 earned this week per 100k staked

I don't understand the rationale for cutting alUSD rewards, alUSD holders are providing value to the project through funds deposited or liquidated.
If we are making adjustments, I think the ALCX direct staking rewards are too high in comparison to SLP, SLP carries much more risk but only holds a 50% premium (currently 9%/week vs 6%/week). Whereas staking alUSD direct actually benefits the project, the only benefit to staking ALCX is incentivizing people not to directly dump ALCX after it being farmed. Being an ALCX holder I'm happy the price is not seeing large crashes, but I'm also starting to view my SLP risk as less attractive and moving to a stronger direct ALCX position with the current rewards structure. If we are going to adjust, I think we should also make a slight adjustment to ALCX direct to SLP rewards as well, as SLP is much higher risk and adds much more benefit to ALCX holders. Recommendation is slight variation of Bulter's:
Increase 3CRV by 2.5% and SLP by 1%, coming from ALCX direct. New rewards:
61% SLP
20.5% 3CRV

This would still increase the incentives for the 3CRV pool, yet retain a little more rewards for the ALCX believers than Scoopy's plan. I would think most people are going to use the 3CRV pool if they want to farm with their alUSD because of the much higher rewards, and if not, they will trade alUSD for another stable regardless. The 3CRV liquidity is more valuable than solely holding alUSD in my opinion. And when new uses for alUSD come out, like maybe a Fuse pool or integration with other protocols, people could swap back to alUSD or yeet into the vault more to have alUSD to use in these other projects. The first option could build an alUSD premium and the second will give us more in our vaults and increase our TVL. "

['[AIP-4] Redirect All Emissions on the alUSD Staking Pool to the 3CRV Pool'],"While I very much agree that making sure we maintain the really good liquidity on the 3CRV pool is extremely important, having an alUSD staking pool with decent rewards helps keep a good portion of those out of the 3CRV pool and contributes towards maintain a healthy ratio of alUSD to other stablecoins in the pool. If we were to see a significant price drop in ALCX, leading to a drop in yield to alUSD3CRV LPs, people would start pulling non-alUSD stablecoins and the ratio could be in danger of putting alUSD significantly below the $1 peg, since even with the transmuter giving out DAI 1:1, there's still an opportunity cost associated with having to wait for it. I don't think it's too farfetched to think that it could trade at like $0.95 or something like that in such a scenario. This would obviously be pretty bad, as it makes it even less likely for other protocols to adopt a supposed $1 stablecoin that consistently trades below the peg. This is why I think just removing all the rewards is too risky while we're still in the early stages and lack adoption of alUSD. Once there's an actual demand for it besides farming the rewards can probably be phased out safely though.
I'm not opposed to reducing the rewards though, but I'd like to err more on the side of caution and keep at least 1% for it. I'm also not opposed to slashing some of the ALCX-only pool's rewards, so with all of this in mind, I would rather see the following distribution:

['Including Borrowers in Rewards'],"Splitting this off from the rewards distribution post since it would need its own implementation.
Lets also toss a small amount, just a few percent, to people who have/had open loans. Capture them as shareholders and improve their account balance. Taking out loans and having debt is useful to Alchemix, we can reward that in shared ownership.
Keeping the reward small is important imo. The idea is to get them a little invested in the platform by tossing them some equity as a starting point for voting, and they can buy more from there if they choose. It should be an invitation to get interested in the token and in voting, not a major shift in the economics of taking out a loan. As @0xdef1 said in the other post, ""And agree about keeping the rewards modest. We need to keep unit economics in line, we don't want to pay in equity more than the revenue that those incentives would generate."" People taking out alUSD loans may also have no interest in the alcx token and likey will just sell it to increase improve their rate. This is about the few who hodl instead. Ultimately taking out a debt position (and getting paid for it as the loan pays itself off!) is useful and good for the platform, so deserves a reward.
Reward should be based on amount of debt x time held. We don't want people opening and liquidating loans repeatedly to farm a static reward.
The reward should also include past borrows. This is an 'airdrop on platform usage' event, and like UNI it should be a historical usage reward. The people who took the early loans out are supporters, and we don't want anyone who sees this conversation to think 'I better wait to take out a loan till after this passes'.

[DRAFT] Incentivizing Debt/Borrowing on Alchemix
Intro & Rationale
Incentives via governance token emissions are a powerful tool to bootstrap growth for DeFi protocols. Alchemix has already shown how effective these can be -- the existing incentives have created a $130M backstop for the alUSD peg, $300M of liquidity for alUSD, as well as deep liquidity for ALCX.
Currently, use of the platform to take out a loan (and let it pay itself off) is not directly incentivized. It is important for Alchemix to have a healthy balance of outstanding loans, as this is the primary source of revenue for the protocol. It is for this reason that I propose creating an incentive for outstanding debt via ALCX emissions.
A Note on Timing
The scarcest resource Alchemix has right now is bandwidth and mindshare of the core team, so it is important to prioritize appropriately. While it is positive to discuss the merits/drawbacks of this proposal, incentivizing debt should not be considered until after at least:
Audits are completed
v2 plans are well understood
Any other high priority items the core team has planned
Prior Art
Like Alchemix, Compound’s revenue depends on borrowers using the protocol. Users are rewarded with COMP tokens based on how much they borrow and how long they borrow for. Similarly, Alpha Homora rewards ALPHA tokens to users who borrow ETH and leverage their LP positions. Both programs have been effective at attracting and keeping end-users.
Incentive Allocation
The purpose of these incentives is to generate real usage, add TVL to the Alchemist contract, and keep it there where it can earn yield and generate protocol revenue. Therefore the reward should be allocated at a constant rate relative to outstanding debt.
Every block, each debt holder would accrue an award amount that is a function of a) the user’s amount of outstanding debt b) the total amount of outstanding debt and c) the ALCX emissions designated for this incentive.
reward = (userDebt / totalDebt) * emissionRate * emissionWeight
Incentive Magnitude
To ensure a sustainable model for user acquisition and growth, unit economics must be considered when determining the incentive amount for borrowers. We want to show that these incentives could feasibly be reduced in the future to the point where they are no longer needed. In the long-term, Alchemix should not pay more in incentives than the revenue that those incentives would generate.
I propose a 5-10% annualized reward. Given the current $100M debt ceiling, and at current ALCX price and emission rate, that would be X-Y% [note: still need to calculate these values] of emissions.
I would also propose that the current alUSD pool reward weight be reduced to zero and be re-allocated to this new incentive. Through self-liquidation, it is possible to get the benefits of that pool without keeping an outstanding loan.
Incentive Distribution
Reward could be distributed in much the same manner as Alpha Homora currently distributes their weekly ALPHA tokens. A calculation is made each week by the multisig to determine reward amounts for each borrower, and a Merkle distributor contract is deployed where users can make claims.
If we choose this method, it is vital that the Alchemix UI can show approximate/pending rewards so as to meet user expectations.
This has the advantage that none of the core Alchemix contracts would need to be modified. However, it does create a weekly chore for developers that can take time away from other tasks. We should strongly consider other proposals for distribution that require less overhead.
Pros
Incentivizes use of the protocol to grow TVL and revenue
Rewards can be reallocated from current alUSD stakers
Cons
Adds weekly chore to developers unless new distribution method proposed
Could create too strong/unsustainable incentive to borrow
We may not need to incentivize borrowing at all, especially if version 2 of the transmuter attracts more users on its own
"
['Including Borrowers in Rewards'],"travisformayor  how i get address alcx ???
"
['Including Borrowers in Rewards'],"I like the idea, but the question is where do you propose those emission rewards come from? I think it would make sense to remove the alUSD staking pool entirely and allocate those emissions towards this purpose, but that's only 2%. The rest would have to come from other pools unless you want to change the total protocol emission rate, which feels like a larger decision. Perhaps the rest can come from the stable pool, which is still steadily gaining in TVL despite the drop in emission percentage. This could indicate that we have room to safely decrease that pool's emissions further

['Auto Compound Staked ALCX Rewards'],"Earlier today there was a discussion on the Discord around auto compounding rewards. Currently this is possible via Mushroom Finance, however their 30% fee makes expensive and prices out community members with smaller stakes.
I'd like to kick off the discussion by proposing that staked ALCX move toward a model similar to xSushi -- xALCX. In this model ALCX holders would stake ALCX for xALCX tokens. These tokens would be a derivative of the staked ALCX and represent the holder's claim to their principle plus their proportion of the compounded rewards. A second contract would then be responsible for harvesting and re-staking the rewards for the ALCX rewards pool daily. Similar to xSushi, the amount of ALCX that xALCX would represent would increase over time as the rewards are auto compounded.
Considerations:
There is an desire among some community members to compound rewards but high gas prices make this prohibitive. By distributing the gas fees across the entire pool we can solve for this issue.
The contract that executes the daily compounding should be compensated for the gas cost of execution. This may slightly reduce the APY for the ALCX pool but the daily compounding should make up for that.
Limiting the scope of this to just the ALCX pool for should allow the discussion to be more focused and the project to be completed more quickly (if this were adopted).
Would this be a project that the core team would take on or would there be a bid/grant process for community members to participate or own this work?"
['Auto Compound Staked ALCX Rewards'],"While I appreciate the benefits of auto-compounding I would want the devs to weigh in on the time/effort involved here. The way I see it V2 and the DAO are of more important than a feature like this. If it's easy and does not impact the timeline then I am all for it but I think we have higher priorities at the moment.  The bid/grant idea isn't a bad one either but we should do the math on the proposed gas costs/impact on yields before a vote. Compounding is also a personal choice and some do/don't so I'm not sure how the community at large will view it. Thanks for posting, definitely worth considering."
['Auto Compound Staked ALCX Rewards'],Thanks very much for putting this together. I also appreciate the benefits here but there is something off-putting to me about a protocol auto-compounding its own rewards. It makes the whole thing a lot more mercenary-feeling and circular. Think it would be best to rely on third party protocols for this.  Also agree that it would be best for the team to focus on the core product.

['Time lock mechanism to incentivize holding ALCX.'],"In addition to adjusting the reward percentages I think it would give the team more flexibility to incentivize holding ALCX if we utilized a lock period.
The lock would give users the option to lock into a pool for a period of time. The benefit of locking is access to instantaneous maximum pool rewards. If the user would rather not lock their capital then the percent rewards they receive over time would increase up to the maximum.
For example, If I were to agree to lock my capital into the SLP pool for 2 weeks I would be able to instantaneously begin to collect the maximum percentage of rewards that my share of the pool could receive. Once the lock period has been reached then I could exit the pool same as a user who did not lock.
If  the user decides not to lock then the reward payout would start at say 25% and increase X% per day until the max reward percent payout is met.
I think adding a time component to the reward emissions allows for a more nuanced approach and gives the team another lever they can pull to incentivize users to hold ALCX.
Would love feedback on this.
-FaizG A.K.A SmoothBrainCapital"
['Time lock mechanism to incentivize holding ALCX.'],"I am all for this, adding a modification suggestion: Instead of a lock, do a 'charge up'. After you stake you start with a low reward, and over the course of X amount of time slowly ramp up the the maximum farming reward for that stake pool. Can be a few days or a few weeks. The idea is to make the only cost to unstaking is the time you put in to charge up that stake. There is no penalty to leaving early, and no one is locked in a pool the need to get out of. I think it creates the same result and incentive, but is kinder on the users."
['Time lock mechanism to incentivize holding ALCX.'],"If I understand FaizG correctly, I believe he is proposing both a time lock and ""charge up"" concept. LP can choose (a) lock up at outset to receive max rewards immediately or (b)  no lock up and and charge up to max over the same period of the lockup. "
['Time lock mechanism to incentivize holding ALCX.'],"JaLa Oh I apologize I didn't see the charge up part was included in the original post. I guess my main point then is to keep the UI, user experience, and development work needed as simple as possible and pick only one of the two mechanisms. They both achieve roughly the same thing. A lock up is only slightly different than a charge up, in the end you get access to the full reward after a delay. Extra features and choices can be added over time, but the first version should be the simplest possible implementation of the idea."
['Time lock mechanism to incentivize holding ALCX.'],@JaLa That is correct. @travisformayor I agree that either  would work and the simplest implementation of this would be ideal especially if/since devs are busy with more important work.  But having the option to lock and receive immediate max rewards might incentivize more folks to lock which could be more valuable to the protocol in the long run.  For instance this could be another metric which to measure confidence/strength in the project. Its like TVL but TVLL. 
['Time lock mechanism to incentivize holding ALCX.'],"For inflationary coins the best way to align incentives for recipients of rewards and the protocol owners is to discourage farm + dump and encourage farm + hold. This proposal does that.
However, adding something like the CRV lockup + boost mechanism (which this proposal is essentially getting at) is probably too much for the devs to implement considering we have only a handful of devs on the team. Focus for devs should be on adding new strategies.
I would vote against this type of proposal on that basis.
I would like to hear what the community thinks about smaller scale timelock mechanism on withdrawing rewards, which could be implemented quite easily by the devs. I speculate that this could bolster the protocol through a barrier to entry for farm + dump strategy. A month long timelock on claiming staking rewards would see us lose a portion of the farm + dump TVL, but stabilize the price and make long term holders feel more comfortable with the protocol.
Risks:
1) Loss of significant portion of TVL from farm + dump whales
2) Difficulty integrating with yield farms leading to further TVL losses
3) Short term price loss
Benefits:
1) Incentivize holders
2) Price appreciation after short term
To be honest after writing this out I am not so sure on the benefits versus the costs here. At the end of the day, yield farms to add to our TVL and benefit the protocol, even if they are not as beneficial as those who are not farming + dumping
"
['Time lock mechanism to incentivize holding ALCX.'],I agree with you.  I'd much rather have the devs focus on building out the protocol than concerning themselves too much with protections against token dumps. I think the proposal to adjust pool reward percentages will have the desired effect with the least amount of work for devs. 
['Time lock mechanism to incentivize holding ALCX.'],"A lock will reduce composability of alcx thus reduce the utilization of alcx. Badger now allows bBadger to be used a collateral in cream: https://app.cream.finance/
"
['Time lock mechanism to incentivize holding ALCX.'],Time-locks are horrible and outdated. Charge up might be a good idea at a later point if we have too much liquidity in the pools.
['Time lock mechanism to incentivize holding ALCX.'],"I think these are good suggestions, it's just a matter of developer resources at the moment. We are currently prioritizing upgrading the transmuter and work on v2, and heavily modifying the farming contract would require a decent amount of time and effort in addition to requiring users to migrate. We are currently evaluating some additional talent, and if we get enough manpower, we can entertain making such changes."
['[IDEAs] Internal restaking and internal stablecoin pools'],"Hello everybody.
I would like to present my idea superficially for the time being. In the hope that it will find both positive and negative constructive criticism and can be perfected.
1. Internal restaking
Basically, in my opinion, there are some huge advantages if you can restake ALCX within the contract(s) without having to transfer them to your own wallet in the meantime. On the one hand, it saves a lot of transaction costs, which would be beneficial for everyone, but especially for small investors. This would make the project even more attractive for them. On the other hand, this is a huge tax advantage in some countries as long as the tokens do not come into contact with your own wallet and you can therefore continue to work with the idea of ​​compound interest. A direct improvement would also be to move the ""rewards"" from the SPL pool to direct participation in the ALCX pool. Based on the same idea.
2. Bearmarket & stablecoins
The second part of my idea focuses on the bear market or better.. the participation in stablecoins within the contract, in order to then feed them into the pool within the contract and participate there in order to support excactly this function. In other words, an internal pool for e.g. DAI-ALCX, USDT-ALCX or other stablecoin-ALCX pools. You could see it as an own ""mini-dex"" for ALCX to sablecoins and vice versa.
This would also save high transaction costs. But even better, tons of taxes for several ppl, based on their country. Additionally, there are fewer reasons to leave the project during a bear market, which would be another reason for the project's longevity and for the loyalty to the ALCX ecosystem. Again, you can work in the Alchemix ecosystem for months to years without having to transfer the shares to your own wallet. This would only be the case if someone wanted to make a profit. And only then you would have to pay taxes in several countries.
Thank you, Meco"

['Funding Round'],"Dear Community, the Alchemix core team is excited to announce a successful funding round in coordination with an active supporter group.
We'd also like to share details of a second, strategic fundraising deal. 
The first deal was made with the longevity of the project and the interests of ALCX token holders in mind. As part of the deal there are some interesting conditions that ALCX token holders should be aware of, so please read through to the end of this announcement.
The final list of investors is as follows (in order of size):
CMS holdings
Alameda Research
Immutable Capital
Nascent
Protoscale Capital
LedgerPrime
eGirl Capital
Fisher8 Capital
Orthogonal Trading
and 1 individual
We agreed to sell our team tokens at the price of $700 per token for the total value of $4.9m. The trading price at the time of the deal (11th of March) was ranging between $680-800. The proceeds of this round have been transferred to the founders to function as personal funding. This compensates us for the speculative and free work taken to progress the project to where it is today. 
It is also important to note that until now we have not received any funding whatsoever.
This is incredibly positive for the outlook of the project offering substantial benefits:
Frees up the founding team to commit to full time development - accelerating towards Alchemix V2
Facilitated our ability to generate funding via OTC, avoiding any sell pressure on the market
The deal also came with conditions for both sides:
The founding team will not sell any ALCX tokens for the remainder of the calendar year
The partners have agreed to a 3 month token lock-up period
We are also working on finalising a strategic sale with exciting partners. Whilst we are unable to go into specifics regarding it since this is still being finalised, we feel it's important to be as transparent as possible.
Unlike the first deal, this will be funding the Alchemix Treasury and will be used to fund business operations to include:
Auditing costs
Contractors and additional staff
Development and infrastructure costs
Marketing budget
Rewarding community members for valuable contributions
The partners are willing and able to provide invaluable support and expertise to the team, including:
Cross protocol facilitation
Legal expertise
Connecting us to auditing firms
Tokenomic analysis
We see both deals as a huge win, aligning the teams objectives and our ability to serve the DeFi Nation with upcoming innovations that will continue to make waves in the space. We hope you are as excited as we are about these developments.
You are invited to reach out in Discord and the forum to ask questions about our future plans.
For the Future of France!"

"[""Let's incentivize Uniswap LPs for mass adoption""]","Scoopy suggested that I write a proposal on whether we should incentivize Uniswap LPs. I believe this would bring a lot of adoption and attention to Alchemix. It would bring ALCX to Uniswap traders in general, where $1,250,000,000 in volume is traded every day.
I shared Alchemix with a few friends and they immediately questioned the legitimacy of the project after seeing the low liquidity on Uniswap, which remains the dominant DEX -- with 4X the volume of Sushiswap.
In this new DEX era, boosting ALCX liquidity on Uniswap would be akin to getting ALCX listed on Binance. Uniswap is where all the eyeballs are and is where most people go first to look into and invest in new projects.
Here is what ThetaRAX said on the topic:
“I’ve had to reply to tweets asking about low liq on Uni. Avg person doesn’t check CoinGecko to find out for themselves. I agree about Uni/DexTools as many find new tokens or liq that way”
Here is what Scoopy said:
“We have no plans to incentivize uniswap LPs at this point. We’ll have our snapshot up and in full action by the weekend though, so if there is enough support, maybe we could allocate a little there Write a proposal on the forums and let the community decide.”
Curious what you all think. Love what you guys are doing!
"
"[""Let's incentivize Uniswap LPs for mass adoption""]","Think initial reaction from people supplying LP on Sushi will be concern over their rewards. The % of rewards would need to be reallocated/split between them. But they can also LP on uniswap as well. BadgerDAO offers rewards for both UNI and Sushi stakers, and it's not uncommon to just split between them. Remember also that LPs get trading fees, so more trade volume = more money, in addition to rewards. I would seriously consider voting for this, but would be curious what the new farming distribution would be (current distribution maybe split with the Sush alcx/eth LPs? The new alcx/eth uni pair wouldn't be something the curv alUSD/3pool LPs could participate in so you would see No votes from them if you reallocated part of their reward)
Improving exchange listing should be the goal of any token, and thankfully we dont need to pay huge fees to exchanges anymore like the ICO days, just decide where to earn rewards."
"[""Let's incentivize Uniswap LPs for mass adoption""]","On one hand ""The DAO will focus on funding projects that will help the Alchemix ecosystem grow, as well as the greater Ethereum community."" sounds like we should vote yes on this because it will attract more users.
On the other hand the team did not plan for Uniswap so they do not see the need to do so. Also, I'd advocate on being selfish here to not split up rewards over 2 DEXs because the community (as is) that is fine with using Sushi does not see this as a farm and dump opportunity.
I'm not a fan of gate keeping but rather would like to see a community building budget before doing this kind of outreach."
"[""Let's incentivize Uniswap LPs for mass adoption""]","I see no need currently to incentivize uniswap pools. When v3 releases and it's hype, it's a different story, but so far it offers nothing more than the sushi LP and rewards would have to split."
"[""Let's incentivize Uniswap LPs for mass adoption""]","I would move to delay action on this until Uniswap v3 ships. Rumor is their layer 2 solution will go live this month or next, and it's likely that pools will need to be migrated over anyways, so what's the harm in waiting a few more weeks?"
"[""Let's incentivize Uniswap LPs for mass adoption""]","I like the discussion here so far. From what I gather the pros are:
-uniswap has higher volume, so a net win for LPs
-uniswap could bring an air of legitimacy for those who only use uniswap
And the cons are:
-it would split liquidity
-uniswap is upgrading to v3 soon(tm) and qould require yet another migration for users/farmers
-Sushi has been a firm supporter and diverting rewards and thus TVL/volume to Sushi wouldn't be the best show of loyalty
Keep up the discussion, especially if you have other points to bring up. Socratic style always leads to the best answer
"
"[""Let's incentivize Uniswap LPs for mass adoption""]","I'd support leaving Uniswap until V3 or whatever the next stage is and weighing pros/cons then, at least for the time being; Alchemix is still very young. Sushi have been really impressive lately imo and most defi users learned enough to be using Alchemix will already be familiar with it. "
"[""Let's incentivize Uniswap LPs for mass adoption""]",I agree that Uniswap is important -- but worth incentivizing post v3 and possibly via Optimism (if that becomes dominant)
"[""Let's incentivize Uniswap LPs for mass adoption""]","I'm in favour of splitting the distribution of rewards for Alcx/eth LPs, across both UNI and Sushi. More liquidity, transactions and visibility. It can only be good for the growth of Alchemix as a money lego. 
Potentially timing could be in a week or two. Not sure about waiting for V3 as a target date, as it could take weeks or months.
Are we sure the SUSHI team think this is a not so positive move going forward? Is it worth reaching out to them on it?"
"[""Let's incentivize Uniswap LPs for mass adoption""]","I’m not sure I love this idea. I do agree that down the line, being on Uniswap is something worth considering, but Alchemix is less than two weeks old, and not showing loyalty to SushiSwap this early on is disagreeable to me—especially since they were helpful to us at our very beginning. Along with this, splitting the rewards among pools would hurt the OGs who got in on the Sushi LP since day one and who have been reked with IL. Those rewards are making the IL worth it. Cutting their rewards and asking them to pay fees to migrate to get those rewards back also seems a bit disloyal.
I understand wanting to reach a wider audience, but this would split our liquidity. And if the only thing stopping someone from investing in ALCX is that it’s not on Uniswap, or that they didn’t do enough research to realize that we do have a very liquid token, then I’m not sure that’s an audience worth being disloyal for. Especially with a protocol that is built on top of so many others and relies on many others, I think loyalty and making friends/partnerships (as cliché as that sounds) is worth its weight in gold. I’m sure Sushi knows that at some point they won’t be our only DEX, but until that’s closer to a necessity or something that would bring a substantial amount of value that would otherwise be missing, I don’t see this as being worth it. To be honest, I’m not sold on it having many tangible benefits. If you are a serious DeFi investor, a token not being on Uniswap isn’t going to deter you from buying into something you believe in. I’m actually in favor of being ignored by people who are just looking for the hot new token."

['[AIP-3] Increasing share of emissions going to ALCX holders'],"Alchemix follows the emissions schedule described here : 
https://alchemix-finance.gitbook.io/alchemix-finance/token-distribution/alcx-monetary-policy
The split of where those emissions go, however, is up to the ALCX community to decide and vote on.
The current split looks like this:
ALCX-ETH sushi pool: 45% 
ALCX-only staking : 5% 
3crv-alUSD pool: 45%
alUSD-only staking : 5%
The emissions for 3CRV rewards have been very useful at boostraping the curve pool, and we are now looking at a curve pool with 283M staked in it, earning an APR of 111.5%.
Personally, I think we could significantly reduce the rewards going to the curve pool while still maintaining the same amount of liquidity in the pool. Stablecoin farmers are used to APRs of 10-40%, so I think the APY itself could be reduced by 50% and stablecoin farmers would mostly stay in the pool. This means we have some flexibility around reducing curve ALCX rewards while still maintain a deeply liquid curve pool.
A reduction in curve rewards would mean that more money can go to ALCX-ETH LP staking and ALCX-only staking, redirecting more of the emissions rewards directly to ALCX holders. This could also have good effects on the price, which could even out the reduction of ALCX rewards on the stablecoin pools.
Overall, the curve alUSD pool is more than deep enough at this point in terms of liquidity (20M alUSD to DAI swaps with almost no slippage!), so this means ALCX holders should probably consider redirecting more rewards towards ALCX-ETH LPing and ALCX-only staking. This could strongly reduce dilution for ALCX holders, granted they are actively engaged in the system by staking their ALCX or ALCX-ETH LP tokens.
To that effect, I would propose this new rewards split: 
ALCX-ETH sushi pool: 65% 
ALCX-only staking : 7.5% 
3crv-alUSD pool: 25%
alUSD-only staking : 2.5%

There are also more details on existing buy back discussion in these conversation notes
"
['Future AIP - Buy Back Program'],"travisformayor 
Just to recap, it was suggested in AIP-2 that a buy back of ALCX should occur using the yield earned on transmuter excess, where bought back ALCX could be stored in the treasury and used to fund development salaries, bug bounties, etc.
Concerns:
A buy back of ALCX to fund dev salaries, in addition to continued supply increase via farming, creates negative pressures on the price of ALCX on two fronts. 
Without positive pressures on ALCX price to counteract the above, the price of ALCX can be expected to decrease over time, which is worse for devs and the protocol as a whole, since it disencentivizes participation in governance.
ALCX bought back that is used to pay devs could increase centralization of governance if used by devs to vote
Possible Solutions:
Forget the buy backs entirely and pay the treasury, (and devs) directly using the transmuter yield in the form of DAI. 
Replace some or all of the supply inflation that is currently used to fund farming rewards with a portion of the bought back ALCX. This would probably require some thought as to how to sufficiently pay devs and the treasury while providing enough yield to encourage farming/usage
Introduce a burn on a portion of the bought back ALCX to create a positive pressure on price.  Upsides would be that it ideally counteracts sell pressures mentioned previously, while also increasing dev salaries if the burn is significant. The down side is that it rewards all holders without requiring any participation in governance, which may be undesirable. Some people also don’t believe in burns as a price driver.
Introduce a hybrid buy back + dividend approach, where a portion of yield goes to the treasury for ALCX buy backs and a portion goes to ALCX stakers that serve as a backstop in the case of a loss of transmuter excess due to a hack or problem with the underlying yield source. Could also allow for more aggressive yield farming of transmuter excess and a looser definition of “excess”
Feel free to argue against any of these points or throw out other suggestions

I would love if ALCX started a trend here of making governance tokens revenue tokens, making the value of holding the token akin to stacking dividends on a blue chip. If we can market around this concept, essentially showing people how much they can earn in alUSD or DAI simply by holding the token it will become extremely valuable.  I'd also consider beyond simple transmuter farming we could use our own tech here, take some of the funds in the transmuter and mint alUSD, swap it back to DAI and farm it again. Adds a hair of risk but if we stay within smart parameters (10-20% of funds available) it will juice further rewards for the DAO."
['Future AIP - Buy Back Program'],"Weinstein  the idea of using transmuter excess to open up one or more debt positions recursively is super interesting and could be a great way to boost the market cap of alUSD, but also sounds complicated and worth additional considerations on the implications, risk, etc.
In any event we should probably direct that  discussion to the AIP-2 thread: https://forum.alchemix.fi/public/d/12-aip-2-transmuter-farming/25 which talks about using transmuter funds for farming and how that should be done. This thread is more about buy backs "
['Future AIP - Buy Back Program'],"Some recommended reading on buy backs for anyone interested https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2020/9/17/stop-burning-tokens-buyback-and-make-instead
I would support the idea of a 'buy back and reward' where the bought back tokens were used for farming rewards. Then you are rewarding the holders of alcx and alusd that are adding the most value to the ecosystem (by supplying liquidity) vs a burn which it was pointed out also rewards idle holders. With the expected expansion into new assets + the long term goals of the project, additional ongoing supplies of ALCX for rewarding current and new LPs sounds like a good thing. And rewards can mean many things, for example you could reward people who vote on proposals (regardless of how they vote obviously) since there is a cost of time to do so."
['Future AIP - Buy Back Program'],"travisformayor Good article, and I think the critiques of burns have some merit. I think both of us and RogueItachi are relatively  on the same page.
I like the idea of paying the devs directly with a portion of the transmuter yield in the form of DAI. The rest of the transmuter yield could be used for ALCX buy backs which would be held in the treasury and used for incentives such as bug bounties, farming rewards, etc.
I also like the idea of changing the ratio of farming rewards over time. At the start the majority could come from supply inflation and a small portion treasury ALCX. As the treasury grows over time perhaps we move those levers in the opposite direction, so that the majority or all of the rewards come from treasury ALCX that has been built up from buy backs and little or none from inflation. I would be interested in hearing opinions on whether ALCX should have a permanent inflation vs a fixed cap. If it becomes possible in the future to sustain farming rewards entirely with treasury ALCX is there a reason for inflation?
I’m also not opposed to the dividend mentioned, but I realize this probably adds a lot of complexity, and @scoopy might have a better idea on how the token should accrue value and be used. In the short term I think buy backs as they’ve been described above, without sell pressure caused by paying devs in ALCX, could be enough to offset the negative pressure of supply inflation. Even moreso if we transition to using some of that ALCX to fund farming in the future "
['Future AIP - Buy Back Program'],"@ButlerAndTheThirdStringers In my initial post, I proposed that all the yield earned farming with the transmuter’s funds would be paid to the treasury in DAI. The percentage of this yield used for the salaries of devs would be paid to them in DAI, along with their current farming rewards. This would allow them to earn a salary without havig to sell their ALCX. We would also use this DAI for DAO ALCX buybacks. This would not be ALCX sent to devs but to the treasury itself to grow it. This would create upward pressure on the price of the token as there is less ALCX on the market. In the beginning, it might not be much pressure, but over time, and as the protocol grows, it can have a significant impact. These buybacks would also grow the treasury, which can be really beneficial for the safety and strength of the protocol in the long run. The bigger the treasury, the more ammo we have if something goes wrong, or to reward people when things go right.
	I do like @travisformayor idea of using some of the ALCX bought back for farming rewards. This would allow us to reward users for taking actions beneficial to the protocol without us having to perpetually mint tokens. It could also allow us to reduce emissions, which would create additional positive pressure on the price of the token and the dollar value of the treasury. The higher the price of ALCX gets, the less of it that needs to be distributed for farming to be worthwhile. "
['Future AIP - Buy Back Program'],"ButlerAndTheThirdStringers The problem I have with dividends is its not clear to people on the outside what is happening and does make adoption harder.

['Reward voting and making it easier'],"Low priority, just sharing thoughts.
Voting costs time, to read everything and stay informed, to show up when a vote is happening, and generally keeping an eye on the proposals board. It's both a job to be a responsible shareholder, and of great value to the project when performed by as many people as possible.
If the goal is to use rewards to incentivize useful actions for the project, why not reward voters as well? What are the technical challenges of getting alcx rewards to snapshot voters, given thats all done off-chain? Has another project implemented something like this before we can lean on?"
['ETH 2.0 Staking Idea'],"Shared this in the Discord and was encouraged to repost in here for official discussion.
When the world migrates to Ethereum 2.0, ETH is going to transform as an asset. Not only will it be a store of value (hopefully deflationary after EIP-1559) and a commodity (to run the EVM), but it will become a capital asset because it can generate yield as a staked asset. As long as the Ethereum platform continues to run, this provides a low risk way to earn with ETH.
When I think about the possibilities with Alchemix, it comes down to the question of where can we get the most reliable yield to pay off the loans? Aside from slashing risk or the risk of Ethereum shutting down completely, I can't really think of a way this wouldn't be reliable in perpetuity. I think this would be attractive for a user because it provides them a very low risk way to both earn interest on their ETH while getting a loan against it.
Interested to see what direction we could take this."
['Reducing emissions to ensure a vibrant community'],"Current emission levels of ALCX tokens are very high.  We have the highest stablecoin yield anywhere currently.  We are earning 900% per year on DAI.  While this will hopefully be good for ensuring a fair distribution, I believe the current inflation schedule outlined here is too high and similar to that of Curve.  The Curve emissions have been quite detrimental to their community because they have a constant downward pressure on price.  I feel like this is what will happen to the Alchemix community as well.  Whether we like it or not price is significantly correlated to quality of community around a project.
I am hoping to start a discussion around reducing emissions to their final level of 2200 ALCX per week faster than initially planned. I am proposing decreasing the amount of ALCX emitted each week by 1300 instead of 130.  This will reduce emissions to 2200 ALCX/week over a period of 18 weeks.  I also understand the values held by the treasury DAO and bug bounty program will need to be altered to account for this reduce in emissions."
['Reducing emissions to ensure a vibrant community'],Why is everyone trying to change emissions? This is not a priority.
['Reducing emissions to ensure a vibrant community'],"Simply because incentives are not strong to hold the token, people will see this as a quick entry and exit if we do not change emissions.  In my opinion it is the highest priority.  Everyone farming on any pool are incentivised to dump their tokens quickly if they look at the emissions schedule.  It will create very negative price action over the next few weeks/months where initial believers get diluted and dumped on instead of rewarded for being here and being a part of this project.  If those people can see the large part of the emissions coming to an end over a period of weeks/months instead of years, then we can probably keep those people around.  Otherwise they will probably leave."
['Reducing emissions to ensure a vibrant community'],Hey sorry I did a fucky wucky; the AIP section should only be open to moderators/admins to post new entries and for members to discuss them. I moved this into open talk so y'all can continue discussing this freely 😀 
['Reducing emissions to ensure a vibrant community'],I don't think we should change the emissions schedule.  It's actually quite low when you scale it out over the next 3y as designed.  Emissions are front loaded so it seems like they're high now but over the next 3y it averages out to about 2185 tokens per day. By the end it's down to about 285 tokens per day.
['Reducing emissions to ensure a vibrant community'],"The reason why we designed this emission schedule is to support the issuance of several al-Tokens in the future (alETH, alBTC, etc). If the rewards drop off a cliff now, we will be hamstrung going into the future.
Furthermore, such a rapid reduction will concentrate the ALCX holders to the early farmers. We'd rather have a strong distribution of holders, and believe the current emissions rate is the best course of action to achieving these goals. "
['Reducing emissions to ensure a vibrant community'],"I get where noah is coming from. Bigger emission does anchor the price towards bottom. Thing is bull market wont last forever and it should be priority for project to get highest possible Mcap as this also leads to higher usage, more credibility more awarness etc, Project that is under 100Mcap is not really popular and to be top project you need at least 1B now.  Curve has big emission and it is struggling to get into top tier although it should be there by mcap. On the other hand you have projects like Cardano that still dont do much but beacuse of the high mcap last bull run and some good community building and marketing got even higher in this one and that does help the project in many ways. You got to play the game and develop good projects, that is  road to success, leaving one out is often fatal.
It also looks to me emission is too big and because everyone know this people farming sell the tokens right away, that is what we do with curve, that is what we do with barnbridge and that is what is anchoring those projects to lower prices. People knowing this will also tend to not invest in token as they know this is the case and in the end it all plays out in a circle hindering growth of token value.

['[AIP-1]  Raise the alUSD debt ceiling from 50m to 100m'],"The Alchemix protocol is rapidly approaching the 50m alUSD debt ceiling. In order to raise this, the governance multisig has initiated a transaction to raise the cap to 100m. However, the decision whether to execute this transaction and the timing of it is something worth discussing and debating.
Pros for raising the cap:
Allows more people to mint alUSD
Increases protocol TVL
Allows alUSD to meet market demand, preventing a premium for alUSD from forming
Cons for raising the cap:
The yearn yvDAI vault has a current cap of 100m (which is being raised soon to meet this demand). Flushing of deposited DAI to yearn would not be allowed in the meantime, leaving DAI to sit idle not earning yield.
With less DAI earning yield, less debt would be paid down and sent to the transmuter.
The Alchemix protocol is very young and experimental, and more TVL means more potential risk for users of the platform.
If too much alUSD gets minted before the official AMM pool is live, then alUSD might experience an increased degree of volatility as it tries to find it's market determined price.
The team's thoughts on this matter are that we should wait to raise the cap until the following conditions are met:
yearn increases the cap for the yvDAI vault
the AMM pool is live and yield farming has been turned on for it
In the interest of not becoming victims of our own success - taking a more conservative approach now will safeguard the future prospects of the Alchemix protocol.
"
['[AIP-1]  Raise the alUSD debt ceiling from 50m to 100m'],scoopy opposed to raising the ceiling. I believe the conservative approach is best. 
['[AIP-1]  Raise the alUSD debt ceiling from 50m to 100m'],I support this. I think having alUSD minting available is essential to prevent a premium on alUSD. A tight alUSD peg is good for the long-term credibility of the protocol

['[AIP-1]  Raise the alUSD debt ceiling from 50m to 100m'],"I agree with the team as well. We lose nothing in the short term by waiting, yet things could be disastrous if we mint too much and there ends up being any sort of problem when the AMM pool is live. We don't want to kill the project before it begins. The pool is an aspect of this project that has yet to be tested. Let's keep everyone's funds as safe as possible for now, ensuring the long term survival of the project. Flash loans can create monsters that are hard to foresee, so why not do our due diligence in this important piece of the protocol? It won't be a long wait either, and everything else will remain fully functional until then as well. Safe vaults, a tight peg, and people itching to get in will only help the token price if that's what anyone is worried about."

['3/5/21 Discord Discussion Notes'],"Several people requested notes on the big brain conversation today (3/5/21 starting around 4pm PST), so here we go.
A significant amount of Dai is in the transmuter, what if it was farmed for project revenue?
    Some needs to be available for transmuting, but not all of it
Example: 85% farmed in yDai, 15% left as Dai for the transmuter on-demand supply. When Dai supply drops to low, single replenish action pulls from the yDai to get Dai back up the the correct level
Similar to the Balancer <> Aave partnership, where unused swap liquidity is placed into aTokens until needed
Transmuter yDai revenue goes to Alchemix treasury
        Revenue can be used for a ALCX Buy Back and Make/Reward program to fund project and ongoing farm rewards(more info)
Adds buy pressure to ALCX, gives the treasury ongoing supply for farms and team vesting/project funding
Discussion around future vaults:
    Rogueltachi’s heart as collateral -> alWaifu loan
        Self explanatory. Critical vault, wen v2
Eth collateral -> alEth loan
        Strategies: short eth (swap alEth for different asset), or long eth’s yield (hold and speedy loan payback)
New pegged asset increases transmuter asset pool with liquidations and yield 
Eth collateral -> alUSD loan
        Strategies: long eth (Buy more eth), or eth exposure + stables for anything
Enables Alchemix to do loans similar to Aave, Compound, Maker, etc. Big market.
Needs to handle for forced liquidation based on LTV
            Classic solution with liquidation bots having gas wars, and all the value going to MEV, is bad
New MEV fighting and friendlier to user options exist
Alchemix could have unique solution based on current liquidation system / mint-to-lend token
Larger discussion around forced liquidation options/solutions needed
Eth + Dai collateral -> alUSD loan
        Mixed collateral, 50% eth and 50% dai, taking out an alUSD loan up to 100% of the Dai value
Eth collateral prevents recursion of Dai->alUSD->Dai->alUSD minting
User retains eth exposure and yeild, and alUSD stays backed by equivalent amount of Dai
Detailed summary here
Bullish takeaways:
Alchemix demonstrates better model than whats used by the largest DeFi projects like Maker, Aave, Compound (airhorn sounds)
Alchemix creating its own alTokens for loan withdrawals solves lender supply issues. Instead of lendable assets shortage and high interest rates, pushes token demand to the pair’s swap pool LPs"

['Feature Question - Dai/USDC/USDT Loan Withdrawals'],"The Dai/alUSD vault is an absolutely amazing and clever option for users. I am new here so apologies if this idea is already being discussed elsewhere.
My question is around giving users the option to withdraw loans directly into one of the other 3pool stablecoins, in addition to the existing alUSD option, by swapping the alUSD for the desired stablecoin in the same transaction. That would put more demand on the alUSD3CRV-f pool, but you could also help that pool at the same time. It's likely users would accept a slightly less ideal negative interest rate on the loan in exchange for convenience of withdrawing to these stablecoins. That extra revenue could then go towards a 'buy back and reward' program that could further incentivize the alUSD3CRV-f pool with additional ongoing $ALCX rewards. I don't know if a buyback and reward style idea is already being discussed, something like this.
This seems like a big usability bonus, and I can see tools like zapper.fi eventually adding it as a wrapper (auto swapping the withdrawal token) on Alchemix loans in their UI. By instead implementing it directly in Alchemix you can capture the value from those users seeking the convenience, and potentially find gas saving opportunities"
['Feature Question - Dai/USDC/USDT Loan Withdrawals'],This would be a cool feature to add. We however cannot implement it because we have locked out smart contracts from interacting with the core alchemist contract. It is a fantastic suggestion and we can contemplate adding it in v2.
