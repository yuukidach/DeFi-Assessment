['New Asset Proposal: pBTC (pNetwork)'],"
Summary
This proposal requests the listing of pBTC as collateral on Cream. pBTC is currently the second-largest non-custodial wrapped BTC on Ethereum (​​https://defipulse.com/btc) with more than 2.5k BTC bridged. It is integrated into major protocols (i.e. Curve) and is available on several chains including Ethereum, Arbitrum, Polygon and BSC.

For

List pBTC as a collateral asset

Against

Do not list pBTC as a collateral asset


Overview
pNetwork is a non-custodial cross-chain routing protocol. It enables the frictionless movement of assets across 11 and counting supported blockchains through pTokens. A pToken (i.e. pBTC) is a wrapped 1:1 pegged asset that can be minted/redeem for the underlying collateral. Collateral for pTokens is stored in a non-custodial fashion on-chain and managed by a network of independent nodes running on secure enclaves (TEE) that act as an additional layer of protection against malicious attack vectors. Thanks to its flexible design, the bridge supports metadata transactions, powering cross-chain interoperability between smart contracts. The project is completely open-sourced and community-oriented, in fact governed by the pNetworkDAO.

Motivation
There are three reasons why adding pBTC as collater on Cream would be beneficial for the Cream ecosystem:

Boost in Cream’s TVL

The most obvious and immediate outcome is the increase in TVL. There is about 150M worth of liquidity of pBTC on Ethereum alone, waiting for new productive ways to leverage capital to gain more exposure (i.e. through leverage) or potentially earn a yield through lending.

Availability on different ecosystems from day one

Thanks to the very nature of pNetwork, pBTC lives on different blockchains and is currently available on Ethereum, Arbitrum, Polygon and BSC. This is beneficial to Cream in that it helps the multi-chain expansion of the protocol with increase activity and liquidity on several chains altogether, provided there is an integration on said chains.

Users acquisition and media exposure

The pNetwork community is a strong and vibrant group of people interested in decentralised finance and keen on governance discussions. We think giving Cream exposure to our +70k Twitter followers and + 7k Telegram community could not only boost an increase in users but most importantly add a thoughtful pool of participants in the day-to-day discussion around governance-related topics.
Boosting TVL, increasing multi-chain availability and fostering users acquisition ultimately means more revenue-generating opportunities for the CREAM protocol.

Summary
The first epoch of Listing Committee is coming to an end, and I also have improvement suggestion for better practice. At the same time, it’s better to begin the nomination for the next epoch (#2) of Listing Committee.
Please nominate candidate and briefly explain why in the thread. Can do self-nomination.
Nomination ends in a week. All nominees will be voting options. Top 5 candidates win the seats. No quoram.

Background
As the decision made by governance, Listing Committee will make decisions for light proposals on behalf of the community.
Light proposals are:

Asset Listing
Reserve Factors
Collateral Factors
Collateral Caps

The Listing Committee is designed to reelect every three months. For more details and records, see C.R.E.A.M. Finance docs",13,61.8,2021-10-07
['Listing Committee Epoch #2 Nomination'],"I would like to nominate the following 4 people as candidates for the Listing Committee.

Max: 0x81f8CaBe89066d43EB4faFD8E4E5256C102E6E30

I have been working with Max for the last couple of weeks and it is clear he is organized, hard working, and has the best interests of C.R.E.A.M. in mind. He also votes every week.


Kiba: 0x6B1050C1C6B288C79Ac1db299Dc481048aBBBbcD

Kiba’s work for Index Coop has been very impressive (launching the Data Economy Index), which demonstrates that he is consistently exploring new themes. Historically he has been quite active in governance forums and he votes every week.


Rolf: 0xd662fA474C0A1346a26374bb4581D1F6D3Fb2d94

Am not too familiar with Rolf or his work, but I recently watched a video of him giving a talk at MCON 2021 and he came across as thoughtful and knowledgeable about this space and its developments. He also votes every week.


Calvin: 0xA619e118960A0ab71EEB410B662CABeC325a9cB0**

Due to his work in the ecosystem and the mission of Impossible Finance, I am not sure you could find a single better person for the listing of BSC projects. Despite the fact he has been less active recently, in this case I think the best thing for C.R.E.A.M. to do would be to make efforts to re-engage him.


5th Spot: Someone from the Fantom Ecosystem

Though I am not very familiar with Fantom, C.R.E.A.M is making a significant commitment to the ecosystem with Fantom Iron Bank. The listing committee is a great opportunity for us to bring some talent in with an advisory role. In addition to providing expertise on Fantom projects the relationship could end up having some upside through future partnerships.

['New Asset Proposal: BiLira Token (TRYB)'],"
Summary
**Project website: bilira.co/en/home
We propose to list BiLira (TRYB) on C.R.E.A.M. BiLira (TRYB), the first fiat-backed stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the Turkish Lira, issued and managed by BiLira organization. BiLira launched in April 2019 to ensure financial inclusion for all and to connect everyone with decentralized financial products. Adding BiLira to the CREAM Finance platform would be a great addition as it has a large number of active DeFi users.
For

Add Bilira (TRYB) as a collateral asset

Against

No Nothing


Motivation
Why is it important to be listed on C.R.E.A.M. money market
C.R.E.A.M. is a top lending protocol on Ethereum, and it has been deployed on BSC. It has a great influence on DeFi market with a great number of users.
Benefits for C.R.E.A.M
BiLira has a large active and vibrant community across multiple social media channels. Onboarding the BiLira (TRYB) token will provide a direct integration into the burgeoning Turkish crypto ecosystem, expand the TVL of the C.R.E.A.M. Finance lending platform and generate more usage.

Background

BiLira token (TRYB) is a fiat-backed stablecoin.
BiLira aims to bridge the gap between centralized and decentralized finance, to offer a convenient on-ramp and off-ramp solution for crypto traders to combat high volatility and to support the future applications of decentralized finance.

['New Collateral Factor Proposal: DPI on Polygon'],"
Summary
DPI is the largest index token made by Index  Coop. It aggregates the value of the top DeFi blue chips on Ethereum into one token so that investors can save time and gas while remaining exposed to the valuations of DeFi.
https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/defipulse-index
For

Change collateral factor of DPI on Polygon from 45% to 65%

Against

Do nothing


Motivation
Cream front-ran the larger money markets in listing DPI. This attracted 10% of all DPI to the platform on Ethereum. Given the current gas situation on ETH, incentivising Polygon use will maintain Cream’s advantage in retaining the small-money users that deposited DPI. Now that Aave listed DPI on ETH, Cream can frontrun the asset again on sidechains like Polygon with a CF ratio that is similar to the ratio on ETH v1.",5,20.8,2021-09-02

Summary
During the first epoch of Listing Committee, we found things that can be improved. So here we suggest a few improvements to make Listing Committee work better and more efficiently.
Details in Specification section.
For

Adopt all the changes, see Specification

Against

Do nothing


Motivation
During the first epoch of Listing Committee, we found something that can be improved:

Lack of transparency to community and potential partners who are interested in working with / or already actively using Cream
Compensation vesting schedule takes too long. 25 CREAM/month vesting in 12 months doesn’t make sense
Lack of standardized process
Lack of resources to get additional help when needed
No minimum commitment required for listing committee members


Background
As voted before, Listing Committee will take care of the light proposals for the whole protocol, including:

Asset Listing
Reserve Factors
Collateral Factors
Collateral Caps


Specification
New rules added:

A budget of $5,000 stables per epoch. This can be used at the Listing Committee’s discretion. We anticipate it being used for dashboards / interns
Listing Committee members must propose at least 1 vote per quarter — otherwise their spots are automatically put up for revote (they can be re-elected)

Existing rules modified:

Compensation vesting period: from vesting over 12 months to vesting over the epoch, meaning 25 CREAM to Listing Committee members at the end of every month.
Minimum voting time: from 72 hours to no minimum voting time


This might not be the final version for voting.
Opinions are welcome. Feel free to discuss in the thread.",7,31.4,2021-10-05
['Improvements for Listing Committee'],"Agree with the more general shortcomings of the listing committee with respect to transparency, communication, and commitment. However, I fail to see how the solution proposed above would succeed in making any lasting changes for the following reasons:


There is already a standardized process defined here, but is not being followed or updated.


Unclear how vesting monthly vs yearly would make disinterested members suddenly active.


1 vote per quarter is way too low a threshold for participation, why not bi-weekly or at least monthly? Considering this is a core business function it does not make sense for it to be treated like a quarterly board call.


meta-gov, rolf, max, vote on everything, while calvin and ben don’t. Have you spoken to them and asked what would make them more active? This isn’t a dig at them, Calvin for example is one of the hardest working and most talented builders in this space.


What you define here is an organizational problem, which needs a concrete plan developed in partnership with the existing listing committee. For example:

Who is accountable for the top of the funnel?
Who is accountable for the follow-up with the applicants?
Who is accountable for posting to the forum?
What specifically is the role of the intern(s)?

I understand that its also possible I’m out of the loop and the listing committee has already produced such a plan internally, but would appreciate if that was made clear in the proposal.",7,6.4,2021-10-05
['Improvements for Listing Committee'],"I don’t know how much of the listing team discussions are “confidential” since they sometimes include information about projects that are requesting listings that aren’t public info yet. Moving as much of the discussion to discord in a publicly viewable channel that only listing and core team members can send messages in would be a big boost for transparency.
For transparency, standardized process, and min requirement from committee members I have a suggestion but it’s not necessarily a good idea. Early on in the first listing committee epoch I suggested forking the Maker Collateral Onboarding Process (example). I think it was a bit too process heavy when we were just figuring out how to work together and coordinate overall. This would make it clear to teams wanting to list their asset what is still needed from them to get it through a vote and we can dedicate specific committee members to different parts of the process to ensure everyone is contributing. The docs @setninja linked about listing process are more about external parties not the listing committee directly so is non-exhaustive. Theres often many more considerations that take place not mentioned in the doc like DEX/CEX liquidity, smart contract risk, expected asset utilization, etc. which I think the Maker framework addresses.
Overall i think having more defined roles that individual members can own would be helpful

One big question I would like to know as a CREAM holder and member of the first epoch is how effective has the listing committee structure actually been?

Have the assets we listed generated higher revenue than assets pre-committee?
Have faster updates to collateral caps helped grow TVL?- Have we increased the servicable market of CREAM?
Is v1 growth and listing committee needed when Iron Bank has similar revenue, better risk/reward, and doesn’t go through listing committee?
Should we be more aggressive with adding new collateral types like LP tokens, synthetic assets, derivatives, ETFs, etc. if we are going to keep v1 active?

['[CEL Token] Collateral Factor Change 0% to 25% on Ethereum'],"
Summary


This proposal aims to increase the collateral factor of CEL token from 0% to 25% on Ethereum to the benefit of both the C.R.E.A.M. and Celsius communities.

For:

Increase the collateral factor of CEL from 0% to 25%.

Against:

Asset Details:
Coingecko: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/celsius-network-token

Collateral Factor Change: CEL 0% to 25% collateral factor on Ethereum

Motivation
CEL token was listed on C.R.E.A.M. in October 2020. At the time of writing this proposal there are approximately 34,900 tokens locked on the platform equal to ~$445K USD. The number of CEL locked on the platform have have fluctuated as low as 4,800 and as high as 446,000; indicating demand to lend/borrow from the Celsius community. See Exhibit A.

Source: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/celsius-network-token

How does increasing the CEL collateral factor benefit the C.R.E.A.M. protocol and community?

Additional Protocol Fees:
There is already $445K USD worth of CEL locked on C.R.E.A.M. and it would be reasonable to expect CEL lending/borrowing activity to increase if the collateral factor is increased. This would benefit iceCREAM holders because the additional lending/borrowing volume would result in additional protocol revenue.
First Mover Advantage:
Currently CEL token is not listed on other lending markets such as AAVE or COMPOUND. By being a first mover, iceCREAM holders would earn all the revenues from CEL lending/borrowing and not have to share them with other platforms.
We appreciate the C.R.E.A.M. community for taking the time to review our proposal and we look forward to reading your reply. We would be happy to answer any questions in the discussion field below!",27,2560.4,2021-10-05

Summary
As the lending arm of Yearn, C.R.E.A.M. Finance will transit the existing Fantom markets from app.cream.finance to Yearn frontend, and it will become the Fantom Iron Bank at launch.
The right of the listing decision will also be transferred from Listing Committee to the Iron Bank team, which is consistent with the current practice of Ethereum Iron Bank.

Motivation
Iron Bank on Ethereum has reached $1B total supply, and the credit limit / whitelisted borrowing has been proven capital efficient with our partners Yearn and Alpha Homora. With Iron Bank launching on Fantom, we can extend the same practice to Fantom, and work with Yearn for the greater market.

['Treasury: CRETH2 Buyback - Request for Comment'],"
Summary
As many of us know, C.R.E.A.M. Staked ETH (CRETH2) has been trading at a discount to 1 ETH of about 10-20% (at time of writing, the discount is ~13% on SushiSwap). More significantly, by sampling C.R.E.A.M validators, the vast majority have already accumulated between 1.9 - 2.2 ETH in rewards, implying a real value of 1.06-1.07eth per CRETH2. I am proposing a structured buyback of CRETH2 with up to 100 ETH from the C.R.E.A.M. treasury for as long as CRETH2 trades below 1 ETH.

Mechanics
C.R.E.A.M. has already proven to be very effective at managing its treasury at its own discretion, and I believe this could be handled in a similar fashion. This will benefit C.R.E.A.M. in an efficient and sustainable manner, and the protocol will be rewarded for providing a service beneficial to CRETH2 holders.
I offer two models for this buyback based on different assumptions about approach and how the market responds. Both scenarios represent approximately a 15% gain over simply staking idle ETH. Accounting for accrued staking rewards from holding CRETH2 over a year following this action, this strategy could outperform idle ETH by 15% + [Staking Reward APY], which would mean about 21% at current figures.
CRETH2 Naturally Trends Towards a Discount
This model consists of a number of purchases, with a slightly decreasing discount over time resulting from our purchases. It would outperform staking 100 ETH over 1 year by ~15.3%.

Market Sustainably Closes Gap
1 buyback of ~43 ETH. This scenario would represent a ~14.8% gain over staking 43 ETH.

Discord Feedback - Provide Liquidity
Upon sharing to Discord, I received many suggestions to model a plan where C.R.E.A.M. provides liquidity to a CRETH2/ETH Pool in addition to buying CRETH2. After review, my current take is that the following two options represent improvements from a profit standpoint, and are also much more effective at maintaining the peg: (1) adding liquidity to the CRETH2/ETH Pool on Sushi or (2) creating a pool on CRV similar to ankrETH/stETH.
(1) SushiSwap CRETH2/ETH
This involves buying a set amount of CRETH2 similar to the second buyback mechanism above, and then providing an equivalent amount of ETH to the already existing CRETH2/ETH pool. C.R.E.A.M. would profit from the initial purchase of tokens in the same manner as the second buyback mechanism, earn farming rewards on total LP deposit (~7% + swap fees), and by increasing the liquidity of the pool more effectively maintain the peg.
(2) CRV CRETH2/ETH
A more ambitious but higher upside plan would consist of the following steps:

C.R.E.A.M. to create a CRV pool for the CRETH2/ETH pair
C.R.E.A.M. to seed liquidity for that pool
C.R.E.A.M. to purchase CVX → votes to incentivize more liquidity to pool to keep peg
Bribe is net profitable if CVX retains value + CRV rewards from our pool.

Summary
Increase collateral factor for GNO from C1 (zero) to C3 (25%) according to the new CF levels. Level C3 was chosen with the expectation that we will submit further CF increases in the future, after “market seasoning” and some time in market passes at 25% CF.

Motivation
Collateralized lending is considered an important step in GNO token maturation as DeFi lego bricks of high utility.
GNO listing on CREAM was a crucial first step to enable collateralized lending for GNO holders.
At the time of writing $500k worth of GNO is already deposited to CREAM which indicate initial interest to provide liquidity and borrow against GNO.
GNO token holders are demonstrating continued interest in utilizing GNO in DeFi with $36M provided as liquidity in Balancer pools.

['Use Treasury Funds to buy Convex ($CVX) rather than buying CRV for Bribes'],"Summary:
Convex Finance is the synergistic flywheel of Curve Finance. It is composed of anonymous CRV developers, at least several of which are closely aligned with CRV, including Charlie Watkins, the chief dev at CRV.
CREAM is presently contributing to Andre Cronje’s bribe project on Curve. Essentially, this is resulting in a biweekly payment to any veCRV wallet addresses who vote for the CREAM v2 gauges.
The bribe protocol is currently able to be followed here: https://cur.vote/
Only 1,309,219.18 veCRV (or 0.49% of all veCRV at 267,394,811.02 total) participated this week in the Bribe protocol. Soon, the number of veCRV eligible to participate in Bribes will increase dramatically on 9/16/21 when Convex initiated voting rights for locked CVX.
Only locked CVX can vote for a gauge pool and carries a ratio of voting rights commiserate with the amount of CRV locked into the convex platform.
i.e. If 30% of the 21million circulating CVX are locked, then these 7 million CVX would control all presently locked cvxCRV (90.5m). As such, 1 CVX would carry the voting power of 12.9 veCRV.
Convex Finance controls 33% Curve Finance governance by virtue of perpetually locking 90.56 million veCRV as cvxCRV into its platform. Because of this, 1 CVX controls 4.6 veCRV at present. TVL on CVX is 7.7Billion, contributing to 54% of the TVL on Curve. Recently, CRV has announced its intention to expand to AVAX, Sol, Arbitrum, Celo. CRV is already on Polygon, Fantom, Ethereum and xDai. Essentially, our participation in gauge voting has supported our belief that CRV is the backbone of defi and likely to continue to outperform other, similar protocols.
By virtue of it’s flywheel, Convex finance is making a mean of 1million per day in protocol fees since its inception. Vote locked CVX will be eligible to vote from Sept 15th 2021 and onward. APY on vote locked CVX is expected to be 20%+. This would provide the treasury with a source of income from its investment as well as a guaranteed biweekly vote for the CREAM v2 related gauges.
Proposal:
I propose that the CREAM treasury allocate funds to CVX purchase and vote lock rather than paying for the Bribe Protocol. It is important to note that this proposal is NOT suggesting CREAM build on the Convex flywheel. That comes with complex tokenomics issues that are not applicable to this proposal.
VOTE FOR (PRO):
This proposal is strictly to suggest that the treasury allocate funds to buy CRV voting rights thru the purchase of CVX. This would benefit CREAM as follows:

Perpetual, weekly GUARANTEED voting rights for the CREAM v2 gauges by an expected ration of 1 CVX controls the vote of approximately 12.9CRV.
Buy the purchase of CVX, CREAM would be able to diversify its treasury and receive income from yield generating, vote locked CVX on the order of 20%+

VOTE AGAINST (CONS):
Risks associated with this proposal include the fact that CVX may not lock as much CRV in the future as predicted, essentially diluting future voting power for token holders. Based on their flywheel Tokenomics with high APY in CRV/CVX and 3CRV rewards, this is unlikely but a possibility.
Another risk is that this is a long-term commitment to CRV gauge voting and if CRV ever voted to stop gauge voting, the value of CVX to the platform would be diminished. I think this is unlikely since CRV’s plan all along has been to provide permissionless, v2 gauges with veCRV based governance…but its still a risk.",9,321.8,2021-09-13
['Use Treasury Funds to buy Convex ($CVX) rather than buying CRV for Bribes'],"I am very much in favor of this strategy. We have fairly substantial reserves we can use to buy CVX without even selling CREAM tokens directly. There are plenty of advantages to this proposal on top of buying cheap CRV votes we can get a high growth asset on our balance sheet, earn yield from staking CVX, and build a relationship with one of the biggest holders of crvIB pool tokens and the top asset management platform (sry YFI).
Disclosure: I bought CVX last week specifically because of @afirebrand 's proposal and i am a big believer in CRV + CREAM and want to make sure we implement this strategy, even if it’s not from directly from CREAM treasury (which we should do too)
Reposting my response to cream team from discord here:
We don’t have to use/sell CREAM we can buy with existing reserves which are in the millions of dollars i believe

How does this investment translate into the protocol fee → Ironbank is our biggest market and 2nd biggest revenue generator. Using CVX to boost crvIB pool will increase liquidity and TVL and therefore fees to CREAM stakers
For every $1 spent in CREAM, how much incremental fee will be generated? → right now locked CVX earns 16% APY [1] so at a minimum it earns $0.16 per $1 spent (until we get diluted by other DAOs). Then you have to account for additional fees from boosting crvIB pool, which increases TVL and protocol usage.
We already spent $100k to bribe CRV pool [2], I didn’t see any analysis on expected results nor a DAO vote before going forward. Why the double standard when he’s given more public/thoughtful discussion with community than cream team themselves? Bribing is purely a loss while buying CVX earns yield and can have price appreciation, its a no brainer if we are experimenting with new incentive mechanisms.
For the same spend efficiency of liquidity incentives, are there any other better alternatives? → Related to above, i haven’t seen data on effectiveness of CREAM’s CRV bribing, however there is data on the effectiveness on buying CVX. Right now 1 CVX = 14 CRV of voting power [3] so ~$1M of CVX has same voting power as all CRV currently voting on crvIB [4] which is valued at ~$35m, a 35x more effective expenditure than buying raw CRV and locking it up.
Can we quantify the impact of risk mentioned in the proposal? What happens if CVX price takes a nose-dive? → it doesnt matter. We still control the underlying CRV that votes to boost our crvIB pool, CVX price doesnt matter.
Is the reward worth the risk taken here? → absolutely. We just yeeted $100k into the air, why not spend $100k buying yield bearing assets that sit on our balance sheet?

['Use Treasury Funds to buy Convex ($CVX) rather than buying CRV for Bribes'],"To address a few of the points that @Eason brought up:
-A lot of protocols are doing this because CVX is a yield baring asset which has governance control of CREAM in order to incentivize the gauges of their native tokens. In this case, these protocols, like CREAM itself, have participated in the bribes.crv, and noted a commiserate increase in gauge APY secondary to bribe participation. For example, on 9/4/21, $SPELL increased their weekly bribe to $400k secondary to the fact that they saw such a marked increase in LP return based on their incentivized gauge weight
(Source: https://twitter.com/AndreCronjeTech/status/1433752882868805638?s=20)
-I would suggest we use the same amount of CREAM on a CVX investment that was previously used unilaterally for bribes. Only this time, the community is choosing to participate in this investment and supports the allocation of funds in anticipation of future treasury revenue from this yield baring asset as well as from token appreciation itself
-Is the risk worth the reward in this case? Well, I would argue yes since the protocol has already spent 1million on this exact same cause with nothing to show for it other than a few weeks gauge incentivization. By spending the same amount of money to buy our own gauge votes, we can incentivize gauges that prioritize CREAM LP pools in perpeteum.",7,1.4,2021-09-15
['Use Treasury Funds to buy Convex ($CVX) rather than buying CRV for Bribes'],"Hey Kiba, afirebrand,
Thank you for the proposal and response! One thing about the proposal that’s not clear to me is: How much CVX do you propose to purchase and what is the lock-up duration for it?
Essentially, this proposal is equivalent to committing a supply-only liquidity incentive for a certain period of time. The key(or a fairly easily overlooked thing) I want to point out here is that Liquidity & TVL aren’t equal to fees. Fees come from borrows. By locking into CVX long-term meaning that your assumption is the borrow will always go up proportionally with the TVL growth. In general, for a double-sided marketplace, locking resources into 1 side of it is a quite risky thing to do, especially in such a dynamic environment. The lack of flexibility here will potentially make us fall into situations where borrow isn’t growing while we continue to spend incentives on supply. We will also get stuck when the spend efficiency drops, i.e. there’s nothing we can do when the marginal cost of CRV incentive gets too high as our resources have already bought the vote.
In terms of CVX APY, the opportunity cost should also be taken into consideration if the idea is to use treasury to buy it. Currently, the asset in treasury is already earning yields so the real additional yield from CVX APY would be the difference in yields plus the variance in CVX values(which would bring additional risk to the balance sheet value). If the goal is to have yield-bearing assets on our balance sheet then I believe there are other options with better risk-adjusted returns.
Again, I want to thank both of you to initiate the discussion here. Please do understand that I am not trying to get people to vote against the proposal. I am simply just raising questions/concerns and requesting more data to ensure that we have all angles covered before making decisions.
How much do you propose to invest and for how long → what is the expected impact in terms of both supply & borrow → how does that compare to having an equal amount of liquid asset at hand → what’s the loss/risk when the marginal cost gets too high.",6,206.2,2021-09-15
['Use Treasury Funds to buy Convex ($CVX) rather than buying CRV for Bribes'],"Appreciate the response. I would propose the treasury purchase up to $500k of $CVX and lock the funds for the duration of 4 months. This is the minimum mandatory locking period for vote locked CVX and would result in a minimal impact on treasury liquidity at hand.
At the present valuation, $500k of $CVX (presently trading at $12.40) would purchase CREAM the right to approximately 40,000 CVX. This is equivalent to the voting rights of 520,000 veCRV as noted by the present ratio of 1 vote locked CVX controlling 13 veCRV votes.
Reference: Dune Analytics
Although your points on liquidity and TVL are well noted, I would note that CREAM’s own TVL is significantly less than Convex’s 8billion TVL and Curve’s 12.5billion TVL. I think most individuals in DeFI are very well aware that TVL can be liquid and that this number is necessarily correlated to fees.  That said, the growth of Convex and Curve in TVL is undeniable. In the space of 4 months (121 days as of today), the Convex protocol has:

Locked 8B in TVL
Achieved protocol revenue of 130million +
Locked 100m CRV into the Convex platform as cvxCRV

I think we can all agree that short and midterm growth of the Curve and Convex ecosystems is likely to be positive as multiple near-term catalysts exist, including:

Launch of Curve on Arbitrum
Launch of Curve on Fantom
Launch of vote incentives/bribes for vote locked CVX on 9/16/21
Curve v2 Pools launch

By purchase of CVX, we gain the opportunity to obtain an appreciating asset with exposure to both CRV and CVX tokens thru protocol revenue rewards paid at 13% APY (paid as cvxCRV) which can then be re-staked for 69% APY. As previously noted, the point of purchasing CVX is NOT strictly for yield baring income. Yes, there are definitely better assets with a higher APY. However, there are NO other assets with as much power to control the Curve gauge weight as much as the vote locked Convex governance token has. This is the reason why MIM and Alchemix have both passed proposals to purchase CVX for their own balance sheets. This is also why Yearn has stopped dumping their yield harvested CVX and why Synthetix, FRAX, and others are also considering proposals to do the exact same thing…just like we are.
I’d leave you with a final thought to consider. Adam Cochrane, a well known crypto influencer and venture capitalist noted Monday that Convex Finance is a “Kingmaker” because of its vote locked control over Curve gauge weights.

As such, if we believe that promotion and incentivization of our Iron Bank LP pools is important for CREAM growth, then I think that CVX + CREAM is a natural progression of CRV bribes + CREAM.",6,51.2,2021-09-15
['Use Treasury Funds to buy Convex ($CVX) rather than buying CRV for Bribes'],"Thanks for the response @eason. It would be very helpful if the CREAM team could provide the report/analysis they used for bribing to further this conversation. From the community’s perspective we have no idea what went behind that initial decision nor the results of the bribing program which should already be available since it only lasted one week and happened a month ago. All we have is the information available to us, none of which is from the cream team. Transparency helps us work better together 



 JCFL:

How much CVX do you propose to purchase and what is the lock-up duration for it?


Speaking for myself, I’m still evaluating if it is a good idea so haven’t proposed specific numbers yet.



 JCFL:

The key(or a fairly easily overlooked thing) I want to point out here is that Liquidity & TVL aren’t equal to fees


Agreed. It would be great to hear how this factored into the CREAM teams decision when they did bribing because the same argument could be made against that.
I sent a proposal directly to CREAM team to start doing DAO to DAO loans a week or two before the Pleasr deal and proposed using IronBank for a DAO loan at Index Coop 7 months ago. This is a huge area for demand, we could be issuing millions of dollars of loans to high quality DAOs driving up utilization. PoolTogether and IndexCoop are two notable DAOs that are ready to pull the trigger once they have a finalized offer they can bring to their DAOs for voting.
I didn’t get much of a response from the CREAM team so we’re developing this on other lending protocols. A proposal for a dedicated Fuse pool is going up soon and im working on getting an Aave grant to build a market for DAO loans. We already have two specialized DAOs to contract out credit rating analysis and accounting reports on loans. I would love to do it through IronBank but I don’t feel we’ve been given the opportunity to do so. Huge opportunity to grow borrow side passing right by CREAM.
There are plenty of other ways to increase usage on CREAM like integrating with wallets like Zapper, Zerion, InstaDapp, Furucombo, etc. That takes a lot of dev work and we have a massive treasury to fund that through bounties/grants if we want to.  Getting direct integrations from other DeFi protocols to build on top is another way, IronBank also provides a great opportunity for that with p2p undercollateralized lending.
Basically my response is “do all the things” and I’m here to help you guys if you ever want it <3



 JCFL:

In terms of CVX APY, the opportunity cost should also be taken into consideration if the idea is to use treasury to buy it. Currently, the asset in treasury is already earning yields so the real additional yield from CVX APY would be the difference in yields plus the variance in CVX values(which would bring additional risk to the balance sheet value). If the goal is to have yield-bearing assets on our balance sheet then I believe there are other options with better risk-adjusted returns.


I mentioned yield but as @afirebrand mentioned, this as an investment in protocol growth not a treasury diversification play. We were asked what the expected ROI is and that’s unknowable until we do it, same as with the bribing scheme. The main difference is we have the ability to recover funds if our CVX experiment fails and we have some baseline returns from farming where as we are guaranteed complete loss of funds from bribing. Risk/reward profile for bribing, from the info available to me, is definitely worse than buying CVX since you can’t even guarantee you get any CRV votes for the money you spend. If you can justify the bribing scheme to yourselves I don’t see how CVX is any different or worse.
We do have $100m of CREAM in the treasury so even a substantial investment would be a fraction of our treasury value,. Market selling is an issue unless we find an OTC buyer. Preferably we borrow against our CREAM and take a loan on IB to fund this but that reduces overall yield and has some risk of liquidation. IronBank has 5,500 CREAM left in the collateral cap which is ~$1m and stables have 5% APY borrow rate which seems like a pretty reasonable bet to make given the potential. Basically 0 change of getting liquidated since we could post $20m in collateral making liquidation price  $16(?) and the CRV APY alone would cover interest payments with CVX APY being profit. Then factor in our actual CREAM protocol growth/fees from using CVX to vote for crvIB incentives and the risk/reward is dramatically in our favor.


Side Comment
At the moment I think we’ve lost the lending protocol game on mainnet and all L2s. We have less capital, less integrations, less reputation, less community, and less liquidity than the majority of our competitors. What that does give us is more potential to experiment and push the boundaries. We HAVE to innovate and be first movers in order to stay competitive whether thats at the product level with IronBank undercollateralized loans or the economic level with schemes like bribing/CVX. Are there risks to doing this CVX deal? Definitely. But there is a much bigger risk if we don’t do anything and lose the edge we do have. Thats a big reason why I proposed the Listing Committee, our v1 edge was long tail assets and we were falling behind on that. In my opinion, IronBank has the most potential and pushing on that as hard as possible is the best way forward for CREAM. CVX is a very reasonable bet to ensure our best product can succeed in a hyper competitive market.",5,1.0,2021-09-15
['Use Treasury Funds to buy Convex ($CVX) rather than buying CRV for Bribes'],"


 afirebrand:

I would propose the treasury purchase up to $500k of $CVX and lock the funds for the duration of 4 months.


Thanks! Can you update this into your proposal post? Having the numbers is really helpful. I think then here I can run some math to help the community project/estimate the additional fee that would be generated from the incremental crvIB pool over the 4 month period:

Currently, the borrow APY of Iron Bank DAI/USDC/USDT are around 5%. Reserve factors are 10% for all of them.
Assuming that the borrow volume will increase at the same rate as growth rate of the supply(as the result of additional reward because now we get to vote for it)
In order to generate an additional $500K protocol fees over the 4 month period, we will then need
`$500K / 10% Reserve Factor / 5% Borrow APY * (12 months / 4 months)
= average $300M increase in supply for the whole 4 month period to just break even.

This means that with the $500K purchase of CVX, the votes we get will need to boost the crvIB pool growth by ~80% AND the borrow volume will need to grow by 80%(or roughly another $120M) just to not have a negative return on this investment. So my remaining question will be:

How much reward APY boost do you think these additional votes will get us?
Does that look like it can increase the volume by 80% for the whole period of time?

Update - should've also taken CVX price into consideration here. The net cost should be the (CVX value after 4 months lock up ends) - $500K. I think then this would've made our expectation on the return more reasonable. We can see the $300M number above as the maximum TVL increase required to break even.
Meanwhile, I do agree that we need to innovate, experiment and push the boundaries. However, from the information presented here, this doesn’t feel like an innovation per se as other protocols are already doing this. Also, I think that the fact you mentioned that we are a protocol with less capital is exactly the reason why we should be extremely cautious about going into a play that favors parties with more capital.",5,6.0,2021-09-16
['Use Treasury Funds to buy Convex ($CVX) rather than buying CRV for Bribes'],"Thanks, the forum does not permit me to edit the original proposal or I would add the proposed amount.
As I’m sure you are aware, there is no way to guarantee that a consistent APY boost can be achieved for the whole 4 months of locking because the amount of tokens locked is variable from day to day. At present, 8 million CVX, or 32.5% of all circulating CVX tokens are locked for the first voting epoch. If more tokens are locked, then the amount of APY achievable would indeed decrease.
Yearn has consistently been using their yveCRV votes to boost the IB LP pools. As such, any CREAM APY that is generated by CVX voting would only serve to augment the yveCRV in a synergistic capacity. I’m not sure why you think that the entire $500k needs to be ROI’ed within the duration of the CVX 4 months lock period. Locking can and would be renewed to continue to generate yield and voting rights for the protocol. With respect, that’s ridiculous and absurd.
This is a long term investment in CREAM’s future. If we did not believe in the CRV + CREAM story, or the CVX + CREAM synergy…then why did we participate (unilaterally I might add) in the first place??",5,6.0,2021-09-16
['Use Treasury Funds to buy Convex ($CVX) rather than buying CRV for Bribes'],"Got it. I see your point now - I guess this is more of a philosophical difference between you and I about investment. For me, it’s much more ridiculous and absurd not to think clearly about potential return(or at least how to measure it) for any significant amount of investment. Even if we don’t want to drill down to fees generated, we should at least have some expectations around:

How much reward APY boost do you think these additional votes will get us?
How much TVL boost do you think it can generate?

That way, we will know how to asses the result and decide whether to continue the investment(assuming that the proposal is passed for the $500K / 4-month period) after the first epoch ends.",5,6.0,2021-09-16
['Use Treasury Funds to buy Convex ($CVX) rather than buying CRV for Bribes'],"Absolutely agree that return on investment MUST be considered for the good of the protocol. That said, if you find ANY investment that can pay 500k back in 4 months, please feel free to let me know because i need to switch over my 401k! Seriously though, 13% APY in interest baring CRV yield will be able to pay back the loan to ourselves in a rapid manner.
500k at 13% APY will more than cover the 5% cost of our loan terms even if we just farmed and dumped the CRV we harvested (which I would not recommend as this too is an appreciating asset which could then be restaked for 70% APY to net more CVX and CRV).
Furthermore, the voting right we would achieve for owning CVX would permit us to achieve an approximately 2.5% increase in CRV for IB pools ontop of any additional boost that yveCRV voting would give us thanks to our control of $ Bought / CVX price * CRV per CVX (see @Kiba’s most excellent calculations from the CURVE discord governance posts).
Lastly, I’m not proposing that we buy $500k/4month period. I’m proposing a 1 time $500k buy of CVX. As you previously noted, we have to mitigate risk and a one time buy would allow us to assess the investment over a defined period of time and then consider if future buys would be viable and profitable to the protocol.",5,16.0,2021-09-16

Summary
We propose to list DODO as a collateral asset for lending and borrowing on Cream Finance on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain and Polygon.
For

Add DODO as a collateral asset

Against

Do not list DODO as a collateral asset


Overview
DODO is focused on building an ecosystem of innovative DeFi products, including SmartTrade trading and aggregation, Crowdpooling, IDO, and an upcoming NFT marketplace. DODO is also a cross-chain protocol and is deployed on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Huobi Eco Chain, Polygon, and soon, Solana.
Currently, DODO is not listed on any money market, yet it is among the top, if not the top aggregator on Binance Smart Chain. It has also attracted the attention of industry professional partners with capital efficient liquidity pools. For instance, Wootrade has already created a series of private pools in DODO and is using their professional market making strategies to provide liquidity.
The DODO founders have extensive experience in smart contract development and were part of the first DeFi community in China. The team is backed by top VCs including Pantera Capital, Framework Ventures, Defiance Capital, Three Arrows Capital, Coinbase Ventures and Binance Labs.

DODO Token Utility
The DODO token has been given several important utilities in addition to its governance function. Token holders currently enjoy the following benefits:

Governance rights: DODO holders can create and vote on proposals
Crowdpooling and IDO allocations
DODO holders may stake vDODO which entitles them to a portion of protocol trading fees


Motivation
#1. Increased TVL
Listing the DODO token would bring a flow of liquidity and TVL in the form of DODO tokens as collateral to borrow against it (current market cap for DODO according to CoinGecko at time of writing is ~$180m). Ultimately, this will generate more revenue for CREAM as the demand for borrowing assets increases and a portion of interest that borrowers pay will be collected by the platform.
#2 Access to DODO community
Listing DODO as collateral would cause a stream of marketing activities that will bring new users to Cream. DODO’s community includes over 21k members of Telegram Group, over 15.8k members on Discord and ~98.3k Twitter followers

"['iceCREAM, proposed CREAM tokenomics']","
Summary (Phase I)
iceCREAM turns CREAM into a productive asset which earns protocol fees.
iceCREAM tokens will have the same three main use cases as CRV - voting, staking, and boosting.

How iceCREAM works:

Lock CREAM between 1 week to 4 years to receive iceCREAM.
iceCREAM becomes non-transferable and non-tradeable.
50%+ of Protocol Reserves going forward will be distributed as ycrvIB tokens to iceCREAM stakers.
1 iceCREAM = 1 vote in the future of C.R.E.A.M. Finance governance.
iceCREAM staked translates to voting power which can be used to determine allocation of CREAM token liquidity mining by chain and market (e.g.- Ethereum, ETH).

If liquidity mining is enabled on borrow markets (more on this as part of phase II)

Once you vote, your vote will remain directed at pools unless modified.
Users will have the ability to change their votes every week and will be able to allocate their iceCREAM to different pools.
iceCREAM allows the user to control CREAM emissions across all C.R.E.A.M. markets in the future.
iceCREAM increases emission from a base factor of 0.4 to a max of 2.5x, the more iceCREAM you stake, the more CREAM you earn.


Minting iceCREAM
Assuming 1000 CREAM vote-locked:




minted
vote-locked




1000

250
1 year


127.4
6 month


63.7

Long-Term Staking CREAM can vote
For the early supporters of C.R.E.A.M. Finance who locked their CREAM in the long-term staking program, these token holders should be entitled to governance alongside iceCREAM holders, but will not be eligible for emission boosts.

Phased Implementation
We propose to implement this new tokenomics in a phased approach, where Phase 1 implements locking CREAM into iceCREAM, migration of voting from CREAM to iceCREAM, and distribution of protocol fees to iceCREAM stakers.

I believe in Cryptocurrency, and recently DeFi in that they will be better currency and financial systems for everyone. I know enough to be dangerous. I’ve been behind the game from the beginning. Discovered mining too late to afford it. Was there when Binance was creating a token yet did not buy even one. Those are a couple examples.

I want to learn yield farming, staking, get lucky and run a few profitable masternodes from the beginning and more. Since I’m a network Tech I like the Masternodes concept for sure.
I need to start somewhere. Im hoping the CREAM platform and also getting involved with SWAG governance earning Squirts and more SWAG by voting being involved would be a good start. I could begin to learn and earn.
I did not like reading about the SWAG token situation. The possibility of a huge scam and theft. Seems to be part of crypto that’s here to stay and that’s too bad.

app.cream.finance/iceCream

image1419×639 37.7 KB

TLDR
Stake/Vest CREAM tokens for iceCREAM (vested CREAM), iceCREAM allows users to earn protocol fees and participate in governance.
Changes
BEFORE: Prior to the new tokenomics, the governance token was CREAM.
AFTER: Vested CREAM (or iceCREAM) becomes the new governance token.
Differences between CREAM and iceCREAM tokens
BEFORE: CREAM tokens are normal ERC20 tokens, and fully transferable and tradeable.
AFTER: There is no change in the CREAM token’s ability to be transferred or traded. However, the new iceCREAM tokens are non-transferable and non-tradeable.
BEFORE: The original use case for the CREAM token was 2-fold: Staking and Governance
AFTER: CREAM tokens can still be staked, however, voting rights now belong to iceCREAM token holders. Additionally, iceCREAM token holders will earn ycrvIB tokens based on protocol fees. As per the proposal, a separate Phase 2 is anticipated where - if successfully voted in by the community - iceCREAM tokens will also be eligible for emissions boosting. This is the same main use case as veCRV.
BEFORE: CREAM token holders voted on protocol proposals. 1 CREAM = 1 vote.
AFTER: Only iceCREAM holders hold voting rights. 1 iceCREAM = 1 vote.
EXCEPTION: Early supporters of C.R.E.A.M. Finance who locked their CREAM in the long-term staking program are still entitled to governance alongside iceCREAM holders, but will not be eligible for emission boosts, should phase 2 pass.

"['New Collateral Factor Proposal: Raise collateral factor of AMP on ETH v1 from 45% (C4) to 60% (C5) and collateral cap from 1,000,000,000 crAMP to 3,000,000,000 crAMP']","Summary
This proposal would increase the collateral factor of AMP on ETH v1 from 45% (C4) to 60% (C5) and the collateral cap from 1,000,000,000 crAMP to 3,000,000,000 crAMP.
AMP is a platform for collateralizing asset transfers and is used as collateral to facilitate payments on the Flexa network.
AMP is ranked in the top 30-50 tokens by market capitalization on
[Coingecko] (Amp price, chart, market cap and info | CoinGecko) and
[Coinmarketcap] (Amp price today, AMP live marketcap, chart, and info | CoinMarketCap) and has between $50-100M daily trading volume (AMP/USD on Coinbase is the most active pair).
Additionally, AMP is one of the top traded tokens on
[Uniswap] (Uniswap Info) (top 50 volume),
[Sushiswap] (SushiSwap Vision) (top 50 volume), and
[Balancer] (Pool management - Balancer) v1 (top 10 volume).
Voting options:
For: Raise the collateral factor of AMP from 45% (C4) to 60% (C5) and the collateral cap from 1,000,000,000 crAMP to 3,000,000,000 crAMP.
Against: Do not make any changes to AMP market
Motivation
The C.R.E.A.M. community first made AMP available as a collateral asset in February 2021. In April 2021, the AMP collateral factor was increased from 0% (C0) to 45% (C4). Since then, AMP has been listed on Coinbase, Binance.us and many global exchanges. AMP staked to the Flexa network has grown to over $1.4 billion and is ranked #1 in TVL for Payments on DeFi Pulse.
The AMP community would like to expand its partnership with C.R.E.A.M. by allowing users to collateralize a larger percentage of their AMP tokens for borrowing other assets. Increasing the collateral cap to 3,000,000,000 crAMP would allow approximately $2.1M total borrowing against $3.6M of AMP (60% LTV). This maximum value is less than 5% of daily average volume on Coinbase AMP/USD alone, and less than 50% of the existing liquidity on either Uniswap or Sushiswap. The AMP community believes that increasing the collateral factor to 60% and the collateral cap to 3,000,000,000 crAMP does not pose any risk to C.R.E.A.M. lenders, borrowers, or the protocol itself.
Background
Amp is an extensible platform for collateralizing asset transfers. More information about AMP can be found at https://amptoken.org/, https://flexa.network/, and the original listing proposal.",11,257.2,2021-08-12

5.*
6.* Version 1 First half 2021 / Staking dashboard released


AXS holders can stake their tokens through the staking dashboard and participate in governance votes brought forward by the Sky Mavis team.
These votes will revolve around which teams should receive funding from the ecosystem fund, and how the Community treasury should be distributed.
Version 2 - Early 2022
More on-chain votes about smaller issues.
Potentially changing the way votes are being counted from 1 token 1 vote to Quadratic voting.
Version 3 - September 2023 / Decentralized Organization
AXS holders determine which governance framework should be used and how much should be voted on. Some decisions will not be up for debate such as token supply which is iron-clad in smart contracts.
Potential things that can be voted on:

Should Axie Infinity Limited continue to pay Sky Mavis to develop Axie Infinity?
Should Axie Infinity use the marketplace created by Sky Mavis?
How should the Community Treasury be used to reward AXS holders and the broader Axie community?
Should the Community Treasury funds be attached to any yield farming/staking services such as Yearn.finance or Rari.Capital?


How is the asset currently used?

*. In early 2021, the Community Treasury went live. The Community Treasury began to receive revenues generated by Axie Infinity as well as a portion of staking rewards. This treasury is by AXS stakers eventually, once the network has become sufficiently decentralized. A more detailed overview of the Treasury can be found here .
The token has been designed in collaboration with Delphi Digital.
6. Emission schedule
AXS will be unlocked in a pre-determined schedule which lasts for 65 months from the public sale. The initial circulating supply is set to 59,985,000 AXS - 22.22% of the total supply.

The above chart illustrates the maximum possible issuance of AXS over the coming years, and the total supply will never exceed 270,000,000

Summary
Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS) is a Protocol for blockchain based notifications that are platform agnostic and incentivized!
With CREAM leveraging EPNS for decentralized notifications, we are looking to achieve the following:

Sending notifications to users with information about important events regarding their active loans.
Initiating notifications when new rewards and Incentive pools are added.
Notifying users about swap pool events.

This represents a big step forward for User Experience, and will have an immediate impact in user engagement and user retention.
For

CREAM will leverage the Ethereum Push Notification Service for decentralized notifications.

Against

“Do nothing”


Motivation
In decentralized finance, innovation is the name of the game. It’s not only about what can be invented, but also how to make the best use of the tools available to improve user experience and create a one-stop-shop for a unique market segment.
As of today, many protocols have to rely either on communicating with their users via email or through social networks such as Twitter, Telegram, etc.
Implementing EPNS decentralized notifications establishes a direct channel (C.R.E.A.M. <=> User) that will allow users to receive important notifications directly to their wallet addresses and earn from it!.
Users will receive a notifications and immediately react to them. For instance: if a loan is coming due; users will receive a notification with a Call To Action link that will take them directly to their loan and take action.

['Proposal: Add wCELO as a collateral asset on Cream'],"
Summary
This is a proposal to list wCELO  (“Wrapped Celo”) on Cream. Wrapped Celo is a 1:1 representation of Celo  on Ethereum (like WBTC for BTC) issued by a qualified custodian (Anchorage Digital Bank)
For

List wCELO (wrapped Celo) as collateral asset starting with 0% collateral factor.

Against

Do nothing.


Celo: the L1
Celo is a mobile-first blockchain that’s EVM compatible. It has implemented a number of important technological innovations. You can find out more about Celo on their Website or on Github.

Motivation: wCELO on Cream
The Celo DeFi ecosystem is gaining momentum. We think that this will translate into a strong demand for derivatives in the asset over the next year or so.
Adopting wCELO would be a net positive for everyone. On one hand, it will grow the utility of the token and its value-proposition on Ethereum. On the other, it will be excellent for Cream as it will make it the de facto goto place to borrow/lend the asset. This also allow us (Wrapped) to introduce ourselves to the Cream community and start a relationship to integrate more assets in the future.

wCELO: Celo on Ethereum
wCELO (“Wrapped Celo”) is an asset backed token representing a Celo deposited in an Anchorage vault. The tokens are a 1:1 representation of Celo on Ethereum.

The Custodian: Anchorage

wCELO is an ERC-1404 token. The ERC-1404 standard augments ERC-20 tokens to make them compatible with asset issuance, whether they are securities or asset-backed tokens. In practice this means that, just like USDT, USDC, or WBTC, the issuer (Anchorage) has the power to restrict an address from transferring the asset.  This is a potential risk to the protocol.

wCELO on-chain
Both contracts (Proxy and Logic) are verified on Etherscan:
Contract (Proxy): Wrapped: wCELO Token | 0xe452e6ea2ddeb012e20db73bf5d3863a3ac8d77a

['Proposal: Add $MASK as a collateral asset on CREAM'],"
Summary
We propose to the CREAM community to list $MASK as a collateral asset.
For

Add $MASK as a collateral asset.

Against

Do nothing.


Motivation


As of July 26 2021, according to Coingecko $MASK market cap is $70,015,066 and average 24hrs trading volume YTD is $53,710,369 with nearly 63 thousand holders. By adding $MASK as a collateral asset, C.R.E.A.M will potentially increase TVL and generate more usage.


MASK Network has an active community with more than 37 thousand followers on Twitter that will be happy to support CREAM Protocol by promoting and marketing the utility of $MASK as a collateral on CREAM on social media.


Through Mask Network, users can directly view the price trend of tokens on CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko on Twitter and conduct transactions on Uniswap and Sushiswap by connecting their wallets. It is possible to seek the similar pattern of ecosystem cooperation between CREAM and MASK.


MASK Network is also starting a Social Defi Aliance that aims to help Defi get mass adoption from regular social network users. From the Wall Street Bet Revolution to Tik Tok investors to the ultra addictive Crypto Twitter, social and finance has proven to be more than a natural fit as we’ve seen from numerous examples. Mask hopes to do this along with CREAM and the rest of the Defi community.



Background
What is MASK?
Mask Network creates a decentralized application ecosystem that bridges the gap between Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 for users, helping them make a seamless transition. It provides the main function of encrypting and decrypting information transmission and evolves around this function, integrating de-private social, borderless payment network, decentralized file storage and sharing, decentralized finance, and governance (DAO) to help users protect their privacy, data, assets and rights on traditional social networks such as Twitter, Facebook, etc.
$MASK is the native token of MaskDAO. The DAO is the owner of the Mask Ecosystem. $MASK holders are members of MaskDAO and possess ownership of the Mask Ecosystem through the DAO. As the native token, $MASK serves as incentives to facilitate governance. Each $MASK represents one vote. Overtime, Mask Network team and ecosystem members will develop more products and services that would accrue value to $MASK. Mask Network will continue to actively engage with top Web 3.0 and DeFi projects as we have done with MetaMask, Mirror, UniSwap, Pancakeswap, Transak, Coinmarketcap etc to expand use cases for $MASK.

['New Collateral Factor Proposal: MLN on ETH Chain'],"Summary:
MLN is the token of Enzyme, the leading on-chain asset management protocol on Ethereum.
Asset Details:
Coingecko token link - Enzyme price, MLN chart, market cap, and info | CoinGecko
Sushiswap liquidity pool - $72.14 | MLN | SushiSwap Analytics
For

Change collateral factor of MLN on ETH from 25% to 45%.

Against

Do nothing.

Motivation:
The Enzyme team is developing the protocol, including giving the MLN token a mature tokenomics where it yields protocol fees. As the frontrunner in public fund management on Ethereum, the protocol’s TVL and token market cap is quickly growing. If Cream gives tokenholders an attractive collateral factor, it will gain unique access to token liquidity. This may be similar to the DPI listing bringing 15% (as of 7/24/21) of all DPI tokens onto Cream.
The MLN token has DEX liquidity and market cap valuation comparable to other tokens listed on Cream with a 45% collateral factor.
Background:
Enzyme allows any user to create their own public/private fund, where they can trade on DEXes and deposit into various yield-producing protocols. It is an aggregator of aggregators. Hopefully the Enzyme team will consider integrating Cream as a protocol, giving the Cream protocol access to more borrowing liquidity.",4,0.8,2021-07-24
['De-Risk Cream From A Tether USDT Collapse'],"Things are not looking good for Tether. It’s not so much a matter of if as it is a matter of when Tether will collapse.
And because we dont really know what a tether collapse would look like, it’s hard to predict how this will play out in the market.

['Proposal: Increase SWAP token collateral from 0% to 25%'],"
Summary
This proposal aims to increase the collateral factor of SWAP from 0% to 25%

Motivation
TrustSwap and the SWAP token had an incredible traction on the Cream platform. The proposal had nearly 2k views and nearly 200 messages. The proposal was passed easily and after a few weeks nearly 2M USD in SWAP were locked on the Cream platform. There is a really high demand from the TrustSwap community to use SWAP as a collateral.

Background
TrustSwap has showed an incredible growth in the last couple of weeks despite the drop in the Crypto Space. Some of the recently achieved Milestones:

More than 1000 new projects started using their Team.Finance platform for team token locks in the last 30 days.
The Crypto App that was aquired by TrustSwap experienced more than 2M downloads in total just on the Android app.
TrustSwap launched great partnerships with companies like Algorand, Avalanche, Decentraland, Digitalbits, etc. to create some of their infrastructure products for their ecosystem
TrustSwap partnered with top VCs like JRR, LD Capital, etc. that are constantly investing in the different Launchpads
TrustSwap partnered with exchanges like Gate.io, MXC and many more that are listing the projects of TrustSwap
The Launchpad total amount raised surpassed 25M USD in July 2021.
TrustSwap launched Mint, a platform where users can easily launch their own token fully audited without the need of any technical background

1400_4201400×420 30.9 KB


Summary
We propose to list LON on C.R.E.A.M. for lending and borrowing.
Token address: 0x0000000000095413afc295d19edeb1ad7b71c952

Action Item
For

Add LON as a collateral asset

Against

Do nothing


Motivation

Why is it important to be listed on C.R.E.A.M. market

C.R.E.A.M. is a Top5 lending protocol on Ethereum, and it has been deployed on BSC, Fantom, Polygon and Arbitrum. It has a great influence on DeFi market with an impressive number of users.
Nearly 50k LON holders currently don’t have a lending & borrowing platform to support them in lending out their LON or borrowing more LON to participate in staking and liquidity mining to gain more income.


Benefits for C.R.E.A.M.

Tokenlon has a very large community (180k+ existing traders and 10m+ users of imToken wallet) and a good amount of token holders (49k addresses holding LON token). LON lending and borrowing market is very large and the demand has a great potential.
Being the first lending platform to add LON as a collateral asset will introduce C.R.E.A.M. to a large number of users and become the first place for them to lend LON.



In short, adding LON on C.R.E.A.M. can introduce C.R.E.A.M. to millions of potential users and increase C.R.E.A.M.’s TVL by a very good amount.

Background

Tokenlon
Tokenlon is a decentralized exchange and payment protocol. It was incubated by imToken in 2017 and currently runs as a separate product and team. imToken is one of the largest decentralized digital asset wallets in the world trusted by millions of users.

900-383900×383 19.3 KB

As one of the first teams building decentralized exchanges in the space, Tokenlon launched its first decentralized exchange in March 2018 and has gone through five major iterations.
Tokenlon Highlights

So far, 180k users have traded more than $17B volume on Tokenlon
Tokenlon is in a unique position to bring imToken’s ten million users to its conversion funnel


LON
The LON token is the utility token of Tokenlon protocol. Token holders can participate in the community governance and enjoy privileges like receiving trading fees discounts while using Tokenlon protocol. Holders can also stake their LON to win a stable income.

For: Allocate 6,666 CREAM for liquidity mining program on Polygon


Against: Do nothing


Background
Liquidity Mining program is definitely a powerful means to expedite the development and strengthen our partnership with Polygon. Besides, with more CREAM we put into the program, Polygon team will provide MATIC to incentivize the community.
It’s a great opportunity that we can work closer with Polygon and grow the ecosystems altogether.

['Proposal: Add Bancor Network Token (BNT) as Collateral Asset with 60% Collateral Factor'],"
Summary
Project website: Bancor
BNT token contract address: 0x1f573d6fb3f13d689ff844b4ce37794d79a7ff1c
Bancor is a Decentralized Exchange protocol on Ethereum and the inventor of automated-market makers (AMMs) on the blockchain. Bancor launched in 2017 and is one of the oldest and more established DeFi platforms. Adding Bancor to the CREAM Finance platform would be a great addition as it has a large number of active DeFi users. As a DEX that offers single sided staking and impermanent loss protection, Bancor integrates with many other DeFi projects and communities.
For

Add Bancor Network Token (BNT) as a collateral asset with 60% Collateral Factor

Against

Do not list Bancor Network Token (BNT) as a collateral asset


Motivation

Access to Bancor’s Growing User Base
Bancor has a large active and vibrant community across multiple social media channels. The largest of these is twitter with 121.9K followers and followed by Telegram with 11.4K members. The Bancor community is very active in governance and has high engagement in weekly community calls.
As users learn about the features (Impermanent Loss Protection and Single Sided Staking) that Bancor provides, the number of unique protected wallets has been incrementing steadily:

image1880×479 34.9 KB


Increased TVL and Revenue for CREAM
Onboarding the Bancor Network Token (BNT) will expand the TVL of CREAM Finance lending platform and allow the Bancor Community to borrow against $BNT.
A collateral factor of 60% for $BNT will help drive liquidity and TVL to the protocol. This will allow BNT holders to lend through CREAM and drive up demand for borrowing assets. Ultimately, this will generate more revenue for CREAM as the demand for borrowing assets increases and a portion of  interest that borrowers pay will be collected by the platform

Protecting CREAM Liquidity Providers
Bancor has two key features that differentiates it from other DEXes:

Single-Sided Exposure: LPs can provide liquidity to a pool with single-sided exposure, either in an ERC20 token (“TKN”) or in BNT.
Impermanent Loss Insurance: Impermanent Loss Insurance accrues over time, by 1% each day, until 100% protection is achieved after 100 days in the pool. There is a 30-day cliff, which means that if a liquidity provider decides to withdraw their position before 30 days passes, they’d incur the same IL loss experienced in a normal, unprotected AMM. If an LP withdraws any time after 100 days, they receive 100% compensation for any loss that occurred in the first 100 days, or anytime thereafter.

The Bancor DAO recently whitelisted CREAM with overwhelming support (95% Majority Support with over 60% Quorum). This allows CREAM LPs to deposit single sided and be protected from any IL that they may experience.
Going forward, with the release of V3 on the horizon, Bancor is looking to once again reinvent AMMs and dramatically increase the capital efficiency of Bancor pools without sacrificing usability by passive liquidity providers. The Bancor community is looking forward to the CREAM community joining us in this journey.

Background
Bancor is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Ethereum and EOS blockchains. The Bancor protocol employs an automated market maker (AMM) smart contract to facilitate token trades against token liquidity pools without matching buyers and sellers. It has a built-in token called BNT that serves as the common price token to fulfill trades among other smart contract tokens. A portion of total trading fees are distributed to Liquidity Providers, or LPs, that deposit tokens into Liquidity Pools. Trading fees also protect user deposits from Impermanent Loss while minted and burned BNT supply maintains the constant market function for continuous token pricing. While Bancor already exists on Ethereum and EOS, it can be integrated into any smart contract-enabled blockchain to provide cross-chain liquidity.

Also the Bancor community has long asked for something like this and the amount of people that want to use lending can clearly be seen by the interest in our vortex which is essentially a non-liquidation loan with some cool capital efficiency mechanics built in to further lock up BNT in the system.

['Q2 Targeted Liquidity Mining Program for C.R.E.A.M. Finance'],"Submitted by Mechanism Capital
Summary
We propose to distribute 90,000 CREAM tokens in the protocol treasury to users that provide liquidity to CREAM’s capital markets across Ethereum (60,000 CREAM) and Binance Smart Chain (30,000 CREAM). The rewards will be vesting with a cliff, such that new CREAM would only begin to enter the market months after the start of the Liquidity Mining Program and will be released to LPs in a linear fashion.
For: Allocate 90k CREAM tokens from the treasury for a targeted liquidity mining program with a duration of 90 days
Against: Nothing changed
Impetus
CREAM has a warchest of tokens, and much of these have already been earmarked by governance for Liquidity Mining purposes. Other competing platforms (like Aave) are beginning to consider offering LM incentives in order to attract TVL, meaning that the battle for liquidity in lending/borrowing markets is heating up. Additionally, CREAM lost a good amount of TVL after the Alpha Hack, which many mistakenly believe to have affected CREAM lenders.
A targeted Liquidity Mining program can boost utilized liquidity and efficient use of the protocol, while also helping to bootstrap the BSC arm of the protocol.
Specifics
936×470 88.3 KB
From the above, we see that the CREAM has over 773k unallocated tokens, some of which can be put to use as part of liquidity mining programs. For this specific program, we propose using 90k CREAM tokens to be distributed over a period of 90 days. Here is a table of how this proposed program stacks up against Aave’s and Compound’s respective LM programs (note that “annualized rate” for CREAM assumes zero LM inflation apart from this 90-day proposed program).
1260×142 51 KB
Although the dollar amount of CREAM distributed daily is lower than the dollar amount of AAVE and COMP distributed, the CREAM platform currently has significantly less liquidity than Aave and Compound, so the rewards are actually proportionally higher (on a TVL basis) than these other LM programs.
In addition to restricting rewards to a brief (i.e. three month) incentive period, the CREAM LM program will also target specific assets. Instead of attempting to grow liquidity on the platform by distributing rewards evenly across assets and chains, we believe that LM should optimize to grow liquidity in the most effective and productive ways possible.
Targeting stablecoin lending
In general, stablecoin lending is less common and less attractive to crypto native lenders, who would rather deposit non-stablecoin assets and borrow stablecoins against them as a form of leverage. In part for this reason, borrow APYs tend to be quite high (upwards of 20% on CREAM) and utilization rates for stablecoin deposits are much higher than they are for other assets like ETH, wBTC, and DeFi governance tokens.
CREAM can help defray the opportunity cost of lending stablecoins by offering CREAM token rewards specifically to stablecoin (i.e. USDT and USDC) depositors. This will create a virtuous fly wheel effect, as more stablecoin deposits will free up more stablecoin borrow liquidity, initially driving down borrow APYs until the additional stablecoin loans are met with borrowers flowing in from other platforms. Moreover, users that prefer to gain extra leverage on their crypto assets will provide more liquidity to non-stablecoin pairs in order to take advantage of additional stablecoin borrow liquidity. In short, incentivizing stablecoin deposits over all other asset deposits (or borrows) will give the CREAM platform the most “bang for the buck.”
Why asset utilization matters
Non-productive deposits—i.e. deposits that sit idle on the platform and are not actually loaned out to willing borrowers—do not produce as much revenue to CREAM holders (in fees). Although revenue declined sharply after the Alpha attack, as a large supplier of FTT removed their collateral, CREAM revenues have since recovered to what they were before the hack, even though TVL remains lower.
As Luciano has pointed out, this is due to the fact that the collateral that was removed was mostly idle collateral that was not being met with equivalent borrow demand, and thus not creating meaningful revenue for the protocol. In fact, although CREAM has less than $200 million (in v1), it is generating over one quarter of what Aave generates in revenue despite Aave having over 20x the TVL. The goal of any liquidity mining program should not be simply to increase TVL, but to increase productive TVL—and targeting stablecoin lending should accomplish just that.
Token distribution
As mentioned above, CREAM tokens will be distributed to liquidity providers in a delayed fashion. The liquidity bootstrapping program will last 90 days, during which no rewards will be distributed. Afterward, there will be an additional 30 day cliff, after which rewards will begin vesting on a weekly basis to be claimed by liquidity providers. Although the tokens will be earmarked for distribution within 90 days, they will be distributed (after the cliff) over a period of 180 days.
The purpose of this distribution schedule is to ensure that the market will be able to absorb any additional sell pressure that results from this bootstrapping program. Liquidity is fickle and mercenary, so we should not delude ourselves about the farm-and-dump potential that programs like these hold. To mitigate some of the worst of the selling effects, this program inflates circulating supply very slowly and over an extended period of time, much like the way Synthetix allows stakers to claim new rewards 52 weeks after their initial deposit.
Why 90k tokens?
Our recommendation of 90k CREAM tokens (or 1k distributed per day for 90 days) is an intentional one. If there are 2.925m CREAM tokens in total, the CREAM from this program represents only 3% of total supply, but of circulating supply it constitutes 14%. Rather than distributing a larger number over a longer period of time, we believe that this aggressive, short-term plan will not set in motion a permanent mechanism that contributes to sell-side pressure (e.g. such as Curve’s token distribution through near-perpetual liquidity mining), but it also provides a substantial amount of new issuance to be claimed by liquidity providers.
On a more granular level, we can map out—using a method we have called liquidity targeting—why this amount of new CREAM is squarely within the optimal range for a liquidity mining distribution like this one. Above, we explored why TVL is a flawed indicator of the health of a lending/borrowing platform (given the large discrepancy between proportional revenue for CREAM and Aave). Instead of starting with TVL as a target metric, it makes sense to target a certain revenue number that would make CREAM even more robust relative to its competitors. Here, we believe that CREAM should aim to close the gap between its and Aave’s daily revenues. CREAM is already undervalued on a revenue basis relative to its competitors, but achieving something closer to revenue parity with Aave would not only increase liquidity on the network but would help to cement CREAM as one of the tier-1 lending/borrowing protocols and would, ceteris paribus, drive substantial value to the CREAM token—potentially even offsetting sell-side pressure that results from liquidity mining inflation.
To achieve revenue parity with Aave, CREAM would need an increase in productive deposits, as mentioned above. An additional $200 million of stablecoin deposits—assuming maximum utilization—would generate an additional 8k in revenue per day. Will 90k CREAM over 90 days bring in this additional $200 million?
A distribution of 1k CREAM per day at a price of $125 per cream means $125k in daily token rewards, or $45 million annualized. If the total assets earning yield were $200 million, that would be 22.5% APR purely on the CREAM inflation alone (i.e. not even factoring in the organic interest); if there were $500 million, that would be 10% APR, etc. Our estimate, given alternatives that are available elsewhere on the market, is that yield has to be above 20% during this period (at static CREAM prices) to be attractive to LPs, meaning that we can expect total yield-earning assets to be around $200 - $400 million. Excluding the Iron Bank, there is less than $50 million in stablecoin liquidity on CREAM across v1 and BSC, so if these rewards were to target only stablecoin deposits on these parts of the platform, we can anticipate additional stablecoin inflows of at least $100-200 million, perhaps even closer to $300 million.
Stablecoin deposits across CREAM v1 and BSC have approximately a 75% utilization rate, which is paralleled on other lending/borrowing platforms like Aave and Compound, so we can further anticipate that whatever additional stablecoin lending liquidity enters CREAM will be utilized at a similar rate (75% is the maximum utilization rate for stablecoin lending on CREAM). If we assume an 75% utilization rate on inflows of $200 million, and we assume that borrowers are paying 20% APR in interest, then that would be an additional $30 million in annualized interest, or $82,000 per day. With a reserve factor of 10% for stablecoins,* that comes out to an additional $8.2k per day in revenue (over $2 million annualized) to the CREAM reserve (and by extension to CREAM holders).
The split between CREAM v1 and Binance Smart Chain
The purpose of this liquidity mining program is to bootstrap protocol liquidity across v1 and BSC, so the question becomes: how much CREAM should be allocated to each?
We believe that bringing more liquidity to CREAM’s BSC arm should be a priority for the protocol. With Ethereum gas fees reaching record levels, BSC recently penetrated through to the crypto mainstream, with leading projects accruing billions of dollars of volume and value locked. Although the migration over to BSC has slowed of late, there remains a great deal of liquidity on this chain, and CREAM should make an effort to establish itself as the leading lending/borrowing protocol on BSC. To that end, we propose allocating one third of LM tokens (30k) to BSC stablecoin lending (with 60k allocated to v1).
This distribution of LM tokens to v1 (Ethereum) vs. BSC is proportional to the current distribution of liquidity across the platforms, since incentivizing liquidity on Ethereum and BSC is the core goal of this program.
*Note that the current reserve factor for stablecoins is 5%. However, this is below the market average (Aave’s reserve factor for stablecoins, for example, is 10%). There is already work being done to revise the reserve factors for the Iron Bank, and we propose that a similar revision in the reserve factors (at least for stablecoins) for v1 and BSC is also in order. However, a revision of the reserve factor may require a separate governance proposal.",38,1127.6,2021-03-19
['Q2 Targeted Liquidity Mining Program for C.R.E.A.M. Finance'],"I have been thinking about LM for CREAM lately too since we have such a massive warchest. I would support this proposal as is but i do have some questions.
Why not provide LP rewards on Iron Bank? - IB is probably the biggest advantage CREAM has in the lending market. With Yearn v2 ramping up, they represent a large (and secure!) customer for IB loans. Proto2proto lending is much more sustainable and will drive further integrations both directly with IB and through Yv2. I’ve even suggested to other DAOs that they use IB for liquidity minting instead of dealing with all the hassle of liquidity mining which is a billion dollar market we can conquer.
Why on BSC? - All the biggest tokens on BSC are also available on mainnet with more liquidity inside and outside of Cream so it has a smaller addressable market and there is less opportunity for integrations which is long term, low effort growth. Binance has the most $ value of liquidations on futures, which applied to lending market makes it a risky bet although we do make more $ from liquidations so maybe thats your plan.
Did you consider providing rewards in CREAM Sushi LP tokens? - From personal experience and what I’ve seen in other projects, if you give people the rewards in LP tokens or get them to deposit their rewards into LP tokens soon after receiving them, that capital tends to be very sticky. Since you are proposing a 1 month cliff and didn’t provide and distribution mechanism I will throw this idea out there: After 90 day program, we calculate all LP rewards based on onchain data and an algorithm we publish before the program starts.Then during 1 month cliff period, we take 90k CREAM, add them to CREAM/ETH or CREAM/YFI pool on SushiSwap on each chain and do a merkle drop to LPs.
Why would I want to LM? - If we hit your target of $200M additional stable coins thats 20% APR in CREAM + 10% APY on real interest (hypothetical). I can already earn 10-20% APY on major stables in AAVE without taking any of the perceived risks of CREAM platform. Do you think that extra 10% is enough to bring LPs to our platform? And especially if they have to wait almost a full year to receive their rewards?
On the topic of growth
I’ve talked to @penguin about this a bit and there are some much cheaper and boring ways we can improve CREAM’s standing in the market. Public perception is the biggest blocker to us leading the market, not financial liquidity although thats important as well. Paying for top notch designer or design agency to update branding (one of the biggest detractors to CREAM), create an actual marketing website at cream.finance, and completely redesign UI/UX of app.cream.finance would have a huge impact on revenue and integrations. For example we lost FTT our biggest client because of ALPHA’s hack and they have not returned despite it being clear there was nothing wrong with CREAM’s contracts.
I’d estimate this would cost $100-200k to get the best possible designers out there and another $100k for RaidGuild or someone to implement. So about 2% of the total cost of this LM program for top tier makeover. This is evergreen content that affects every interaction people have with CREAM which is a much bigger factor than liquidity.
I personally withdrew all my capital from CREAM because of FTT and SWAG and have not put back in because those issues were never resolved to my satisfaction. At one point in DeFi summer I was something like 0.1% of all TVL in CREAM and I’ve heard similar things from other heavy DeFi users. The 3 separate hacks (alpha, furucombo, DNS) in the last month or two isn’t helping with this perception at all. A visual transformation is needed to show that CREAM isn’t the shitcoin farm it was last year and is a serious tier 1 platform like we want it to be.",36,347.2,2021-03-19
['Q2 Targeted Liquidity Mining Program for C.R.E.A.M. Finance'],"Thanks Ben, this is an excellent idea.
I agree USD depositors should get the most rewards, but also think other depositors ought to get at least something, and perhaps Uni LP/SLP suppliers ought to get a decent cut of rewards too as those deposits are quite productive.
I have also wondered about whether locked rewards-earning CREAM should be able to become collateralized, which I believe would help to grow the protocol as well.",28,70.6,2021-03-19
['Q2 Targeted Liquidity Mining Program for C.R.E.A.M. Finance'],Nah stablecoins are definitely the right target. Right now your only low interest options on CREAM are either DeFi tokens or LP tokens.

['Q2 Targeted Liquidity Mining Program for C.R.E.A.M. Finance'],"Yes I know you guys are working hard because I follow the project. My point is it’s about public perception across entire crypto community, not just cream users. My perception is that cream can achieve more with qualitative fixes (better branding/ui, crypto-twitter relations) than quantitative fixes (stablecoin liquidity, asset caps). If you guys dont feel that way, im sure you’ve done more user research than i have on how to improve the platform and are targeting the most effective things.",26,95.2,2021-03-23
['Q2 Targeted Liquidity Mining Program for C.R.E.A.M. Finance'],"Another thought I had. Can’t we leverage our partnership with Yearn to create a strategy that specifically only deposits in CREAM on top of the general lending strategy? We consistently have the highest APY on stables + our revenue is Yearn’s revenue so makes sense to target our platform for yield options which also increases Yearn ecosystem’s moat
Separate thought: When calculating CREAM rewards for LPs, we should take their net total amount borrowed instead of absolute total. Meaning if I deposit $100k USDC, borrow $80k USDC, then deposit $80k USDC, my rewards would only be for $100k USDC not $180k USDC. As an expert farmer I guarantee people will do this and it provides little value to the platform.",24,9.8,2021-03-21
['Q2 Targeted Liquidity Mining Program for C.R.E.A.M. Finance'],"This is a well thought out proposal and definitely needed to keep CREAM competitive for LP’s
I also think that this has to be tied with some of the marketing changes that @Kiba laid out - otherwise this capital will leave the platform as fast as it joins",20,104.0,2021-03-22
['Q2 Targeted Liquidity Mining Program for C.R.E.A.M. Finance'],"To be dead honest, until recently, with my deeper looking, I always considered CREAM, a second choice. On etherum, why not use aave or comp. On bsc, Venus incentives are the best anywhere.
I used cream for it’s niche uses, crETH2 lending, Yfi lending on BSC . Thing like this. But it is very true that I hesitated to borrow USD because of the higher apy costs.
So I support the idea of incentivings stable coins, bit not them all.
On BSC BUSD is priority, on ETH perhaps someone else can speak, there is a lot of options for the 3pool 3
If cream emits cream tokens, you can be sure that vaults are going to leverage up deposits and farm. Is there some way to avoid this? Does this even matter?
I’d love to select a few of my hodl tokens and say incentivise borrowing these, but people borrow not for rewards, but for opportunities for that coin elsewhere. Vaults are the only ones that tend to borrow anything with yield.
I like the idea of a cliff, it’s simple and to the point…it’s not a sweep in and grab your cream and skip town plan.

Motivation
There is no coverage of the for USDT on FTM, and the BSC version is unofficially minted
Background
Let’s start with the easy one.
FTM (Opera)
This is straightforward. There is no support for the USDT token. fUSDT
Total Supply: 453,355.291722 fUSDT
There has been a lot of fUSDT migrated up to Fantom in anticipation of the Popsicle Airdrop of ICE and the farming opportunity there. This farming opp will last for 4 weeks, and it would be great if there was a place to park that fUSDT after that time.
Now, for the tricky one.
BSC Binance Smart Chain
The current USDT found all over BSC is actually Binance Pegged USDT
Total Supply: 880,000,000 BUSD-T
however, the official USDT minter produces fUSDT via the multichain.xyz bridge.
Total Supply: 238,851.183809 fUSDT
This same opportunity mention above on Opera (FTM) will also start on BSC, but this will only accept the fUSDT and not BUSD-T. Furthermore, LPs for fUSDT/BUSD-T are right around the corner.

['Proposal: Add WOO as a collateral asset'],"
Summary
We think $WOO would be a great addition to the Cream Finance platform. Wootrade is a liquidity solution and trading network used by 20+ institutions. The community is rapidly growing and as of now, the token isn’t listed on any other lending platforms in the DeFi space. This would be a good opportunity to introduce Cream Finance to an active community of DeFi users. Wootrade is also very vocal and eager to integrate and support other DeFi platforms.

Additional Details
CoinGecko ranking: 143
Market cap: ~600m USD
Token holders: ~7000 (Ethereum)
Current markets: Huobi (spot and futures), Gate, MXC, AscendEx (Formerly BitMax), WOO X Beta, Uniswap (ETH and USDC), SushiSwap (USDC), Bancor, Hoo
Wootrade can be simplified into three main parts:


A B2B institutional trading network


WOO X Beta, an exchange for active traders


DeFi liquidity solution with on-chain capital


All three are related to Wootrade’s key strength, which is providing the cheapest liquidity in the space. Wootrade does this by using a zero-fee method, which they are able to provide due to their background as institutional quantitative market makers (Kronos Research). The founders have extensive experience at top traditional finance firms like BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, etc. They are backed by top VCs including Dragonfly Capital, Three Arrows Capital, and Fenbushi Capital.

Integrations in DeFi to date:
WOO/ETH on Uniswap - TVL: $17.2 m
WOO/USDC on Uniswap
WOO/USDC on SushiSwap
WOO/BNT on Bancor
WOO/USDT on Mdex

Token Security:
WOO does not have an elastic supply, or rebase mechanism. The Wootrade ERC-20 contracts do not have permissions that grant administrators unrestricted mint/burn capabilities. WOO is a capped-supply token with a total supply of 3 billion tokens and circulating supply of 432,413,779.00 WOO. The contracts and addresses with the highest concentration (top 10 and >1% of circulating supply) of WOO tokens are the token vesting contracts, one Huobi wallet, one Bitmax wallet, team wallets and a wallet with 1.86%.

Community and Communication
Wootrade is active on Reddit and Telegram. The Wootrade team also operates official Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn and Medium accounts. Github activity is limited to the Wootrade documentation, with activity since 27th August, 2019. The development team is presented on the Wootrade website. The team integrates Kronos Research co-founders Jack Tan and Mark Pimentel.
The team’s official e-mail contact is admin@woo.network.

['Proposal: Whitelist ibBTC as a collateral asset'],"
Summary
We propose to add $ibBTC to CREAM for lending and borrowing.
ibBTC is well on its way to becoming the easiest onramp for any user holding bitcoin to put it to work through DeFi. ibBTC was developed jointly by BadgerDAO & DefiDollar and went live on May 8, 2021.
ibBTC has completed a 3 phase guarded launch and is now open for all to mint. The TVL currently stands at  633 BTC (~ $24 Million) .
Should this proposal be accepted, CREAM would be the first lending protocol to accept ibBTC tokens as collateral across DeFi…
For

Add ibBTC as a collateral asset

Against

Do nothing


Motivation

Why ibBTC?
Liquidity of tokenized BTC on Ethereum is spread across different flavors namely wBTC, renBTC, tBTC & sBTC. ibBTC bundles them together to build a yUSD equivalent for BTC that would become the default BTC denominated asset on Ethereum while enabling users to stack more sats, the DeFi way!
For Badgers and the broader community it opens up a whole new world of opportunities. No longer will your deposits in the Badger Bitcoin vaults be illiquid, as users can now use their vault positions to mint ibBTC and leverage that asset across DeFi. Think lending, borrowing, farming, providing liquidity and bringing it cross-chain.
Currently, the tokens utility comes from the new Sushiswap ibBTC/WBTC pool where users deposit their LP token into a Badger vault for boosted APY and little impermanent loss.

Benefits for CREAM
Increased TVL for Cream: This proposal will allow the CREAM TVL to expand and will allow the community to borrow other assets against their $ibBTC.
$ibBTC is an interest bearing asset that continuously gets stronger with time. This is great for users borrowing against it as it will effectively offset the borrowing rate to a degree.
This will spur interest from both the Badger and DefiDollar community. Combined together we bring along a vibrant community of 46,000+ followers, on Twitter.

Background

What Is Badger?
BadgerDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) focused on building the products and infrastructure necessary to accelerate Bitcoin as collateral across other blockchains. Badger is a community-led initiative that prioritizes collaboration over competition and operates on fairness, transparency, and high collective engagement.

What is DefiDollar?
DefiDollar is a multi-chain DeFi Protocol Lab. We are building a range of products for the open finance ecosystem enabling yield generation, diversification and capital efficiency.

['Proposal: Whitelist ibBTC as a collateral asset'],"I support this proposal.
An oracle for ibBTC has already been developed. It takes into account the interest-bearing-ness of the asset via ibBTC.pricePerShare() - which continually increases when harvest strategies are run on the underlying badger sett vaults. It will be very interesting to see the dynamics of borrowing against such an asset as it offsets the borrow APY.
It will bring in much more borrow demand on Cream, because there are a huge number of users who like to borrow against Bitcoin, while their collateral auto-compounds for them.",30,611.0,2021-05-28
['Proposal: Whitelist ibBTC as a collateral asset'],I support this proposal to add ibBTC as collateral to Cream.  ibBTC is clearly ahead of the curve in recognizing that people want a composable bitcoin asset that collects yield.

['Provide Grant To Coordinape'],"co-authored: Max (farmerdefi) & @lumberg

Summary
Coordinape is a product for DAOs first built for Yearn Finance – and is now growing to service other DAOs. Coordinape enables DAOs to scale communities with tools to reward contributors, incentivize participation, and manage resources.
Today, C.R.E.A.M. Finance uses Coordinape to allocate payments to all non-core team members.
We propose that Coordinape receives a grant of $50,000 $USDC from the CREAM Treasury.
For: Grant Coordinape $50,000 $USDC to help them scale their offerings and continue working closely to fulfill the needs of C.R.E.A.M. Finance.
Against: Do Nothing.

Motivation
C.R.E.A.M. Finance uses Coordinape and we want to see them succeed.

Background
How does Coordinape work: Each Coordinape member will have a set quantity of “allocation points” – which they can distribute to other members whom they have worked with during a given month. Members with the most interactions and allocations will receive weighted portions of the grants budget.
As described by Tracheopteryx of Yearn Finance, the ultimate goal is to “move more decision-making powers off of the multisig’s shoulders and onto a network of autonomous and self-managed teams.”
We want to ensure all community members get paid for work they are doing to benefit C.R.E.A.M. Finance … and want to provide a grant to Coordinape to see this become a reality.",16,463.2,2021-06-16
['Provide Grant To Coordinape'],"+1. Coordinape has the potential to provide a long-term history of value flows that is vetted by third parties, all of which is transparent. It’s both a reward and incentive mechanism for providing value, and has the potential to systematically spread out the provision of rewards in a decentralized yet fair way.",13,17.6,2021-06-18

['CREAM Developer Grant: Reward Key Contributor'],"co-authored: Max (farmerdefi) & @lumberg

Summary
In January, a grant was proposed and passed to reward non-core developers for contributing to C.R.E.A.M. Finance. Two Yearn Strategists, Sam and Carlos, received 700 $CREAM each for their work.
We propose that dudesahn receives a grant of 700 $CREAM from the CREAM Treasury.
For: Grant @dudesahn 700 CREAM tokens for his contributions to C.R.E.A.M. Finance / Iron Bank.
Against: Do Nothing.

Motivation
Dudesahn’s work has been critical to the recent success of C.R.E.A.M. Finance. Dudesahn built the Iron Bank yearn vault (yvcrvIB) – which has accumulated $356,279,499.
Additionally, dudesahn’s proposal (on the CREAM forum) to list v2 yVault tokens has led to the growth of C.R.E.A.M. v1, and deeper collaboration on the protocol level with Yearn Finance.

Background
Dudesahn has worked alongside Andre and the CREAM developer team since the inception of the Iron Bank, without any promise of compensation. He is a passionate developer and a DeFi subject matter expert. The Iron Bank would not be where it is today without his contributions.
We would like to recognize Dudesahn’s contribution to C.R.E.A.M., and encourage Dudesahn to keep up the great work!",15,638.0,2021-06-16

['Proposal: Add $IDLE as collateral asset on CREAM'],"Hi everyone!
I’m Emiliano, member of Idle DAO and Project Manager for its Treasury League, and I would like to propose to the CREAM community to list IDLE as collateral asset.

What is IDLE?
Idle is a decentralized yield aggregator and rebalancing protocol, allowing users to use two different strategies to earn the yield they are looking for:

The Best-Yield allocation strategy allows to maximize the interest rate returns by detecting the interest rate changes on other lending protocols;
The Risk-Adjusted allocation strategy provides a way to earn the best rate at the lowest risk level.

Learn more about Idle strategies here.
Idle has integrated many lending providers (such as Compound, AAVE) and currently supports the following underlying tokens: DAI, USDC, USDT, SUSD, TUSD, WBTC, WETH, and *RAI (you can lend RAI on the beta dashboard).

For: Add IDLE as collateral asset


Against: Do nothing


Market Statistics & Info

IDLE is currently launched on:

Sushiswap (date listed: Dec-11-2020)
Uniswap (date listed: Nov-26-2020)
Balancer (creation date: Feb-3-2021)
Hotbit (date listed: Dec-3-2020)


Market cap: ~$12,000,000
Token holders: 3,071
Circulating supply: 1,742,607 / 13,000,000
Token distribution: Token Distribution - Idle



Why IDLE

Since November 2020 the TVL increased from $2M to $255M;
Idle enabled LP Staking and, after the community approved the proposal, is going to release in the next weeks single $IDLE staking with lockup and fee-sharing;
Idle is currently deploying into CREAM part of the $3M deposited in the idleRAI strategy;
The proposal to have CREAM listed on USDT passed the snapshot and will move to integration phase, with millions of $ that could come into CREAM, potentially increasing its TVL;
Idle is collaborating with various integration partners for yield optimization (e.g. Yearn, Enzyme, PoolTogether, Harvest) and asset integration (e.g. RAI);
We are discussing and planning the next steps regarding Treasury diversification; thus, having IDLE as collateral on CREAM would allow the governance to consider stablecoin loans.


Security
Idle takes security seriously:


$500k Bug Bounty Program;

Integration Standard Requirement for protocols that want to be integrated into Idle;

Benefits to CREAM

By adding IDLE as a collateral asset, C.R.E.A.M will increase TVL and generate more usage;
The Idle League Treasury Team is committed to publicly marketing and promoting the additional utility of IDLE as collateral in CREAM with ~10k Twitter followers;

"['Proposal: Increase VSP, VVSP collateral factor to C2']","
Summary
Increase collateral factor for VSP, VVSP from C1 (zero) to C2 (10%) according to the new CF levels.   Level C2 was chosen with the expectation that we will submit further CF increases in the future, after “market seasoning”, after some time in market passes at 10% CF.
For
Collateral factor of VSP, VVSP is increased to C2 level.
Against
Do nothing.

Motivation
We are trying out the new C-levels system.  Please give us your feedback!
For CREAM:   CREAM is already proving popular within the Vesper community, based on the recent listing and community chatter.  This is introducing CREAM to a blue chip retail/institutional DeFi audience, as well as the usual increases-CREAM-TVL rationale.
For Vesper, this opens the power of “AxB” DeFi lending, which opens a large array of new possibilities for Vesper users, in particular the VVSP token (similar to XSUSHI) token.

self-disclosure of the downside

Collateralized lending is considered an important step in VSP and VVSP token maturation as DeFi lego bricks of high utility.   It would slow down Vesper.

['Proposal: add TrueFi (tfTUSD & tfUSDC) as collateral assets'],"
Summary
Hey C.R.E.A.M community!
This is a proposal to request the addition of Trufi’s tfTokens as a collateral asset on C.R.E.A.M Ethereum, starting with a collateral factor of 0%
The tfToken represents the value of funds a user deposits into TrueFi lending pools. In the simplest terms, tfTokens are tokenized deposit receipts that naturally grow in value as the lending pools generate yield.
For


Add $tfTokens (tfTUSD & tfUSDC)


Against


Do nothing



Background
TrueFi provides uncollateralized lending to creditworthy borrowers including Almeda Research, Invictus Capital, and more. With $105.5M in loans originated, TrueFi’s community base has been steadily growing with a mix of new users in defi and OG’s from the TrustToken base community.

Additional Detail
Within the TrueFi ecosystem, there are two tfTokens to date:

tfUSDC Token (0xA991356d261fbaF194463aF6DF8f0464F8f1c742)

Dune analytics
Price: $1.00
TVL: $89M
Total lenders: 78
Note: The USDC pool launched on 05/20/21

tfTUSD Token (0xa1e72267084192Db7387c8CC1328fadE470e4149)

Price: $1.067
Current supply/max supply: 92,641,223
Token holders: 147

Token Mechanics
Today when a user deposits TUSD or USDC into the pool, they receive tfTokens. For example, If you were to deposit 100 TUSD you would receive ~93.72 tfTUSD tokens (100/1.067).
The pool tokens represent a claim on:

TUSD or USDC
yCRV (where idle TUSD or USDC is put to work to generate interest)
CRV (farming)
90% of interest generated from each matured loan (as 10% goes to stakers)

At the moment, there is little utility for tfTokens so many users will swap for TUSD on Uniswap if they have a need for collateral.

Motivation:
A listing on C.R.E.A.M. would allow users to take advantage of a natural interest bearing tfToken, but still access the borrowing potential of these assets as collateral on C.R.E.A.M. This would naturally incentive deposits into C.R.E.A.M. as total yield economics would be much higher compared to the base asset.
As of now the tokens are not listed as a collateral asset on any other lending platforms. This would provide a great opportunity to introduce new users to the C.R.E.A.M community.
In short this would increase tfToken utility while increasing C.R.E.A.M. TVL and drive borrower demand.

In practice, they work similarly to something like cTokens where they start at 1.00 and as they accrue interest, the value increases. In the case of tfTUSD, it’s been live for just over 6 months and the fact that it’s priced at $1.067 means that it’s earned an annualized (unboosted) interest rate of roughly 13%.
Right now, most people who deposit into our lending pools take their tfTokens and stake them in our farms to earn $TRU, but we’d love to give our users other ways to use their tokens and having them as a form of collateral on CREAM would be our #1 choice to suggest to our community.

Q1: What is Collateral Factor?

Collateral Factor is the maximum limited amount users can borrow from the asset they have supplied.
For example, the Collateral Factor of ETH is 75%. If the user supplied 1 ETH worth $2500 and enabled the supplied ETH as collateral, the borrow limit of the user would be $1875 (1ETH * 75%) worth of borrowing asset on C.R.E.A.M.

Q2: What is Used as Collateral ?

This is the state if the user uses the asset as collateral.

Yes means ‘This asset is used as collateral’*
No means ‘This asset is not used as collateral.’*


Q3: What is Collateral Balance?

Collateral Balance represents the amount of the asset which is enabled as collateral.
Collateral Balance will be equal or less than Supply Balance. For some specific assets having a Collateral Cap limit, the user may not have their total supplied asset as collateral, but part of them will be accepted as collateral.


About Collateral Cap
The Collateral Cap feature specifies a market’s maximum effective collateral, measured in units of the market’s token. If a market’s collateral cap is set to 1M, it means only 1M of the token can be used as collateral. Details  here.


Q4: What is Collateral Remain and how does the Register button work?

Collateral Remain is showing the buffer between Collateral Cap and the current Total Collateral Balance.   If a collateral buffer remains on the market and the user’s collateral balance is lower than his supply balance, more collateral may be registered. The user can click on the Register button to send the transaction for enabling more collateral and the protocol will allow as much collateral as possible.


Total Collateral Balance: The total sum of the Collateral Balance for each user.

Register action is equal to enabling collateral again.

['Proposal to add SPIRIT to CREAM as a collateral asset'],"
Summary

The Spirit community (19,300 addresses strong) would like to propose adding $SPIRIT to the Cream Finance platform as a collateral asset. SPIRIT is the native protocol token to the SPIRITSWAP DEX (on Fantom). “Spirit is earnt by staking or providing liquidity to our DEX and farming either directly through our farming portal within our DApp or auto compounding vaults like supra.finance and frankenstein.finance”.
SpiritSwap is a prominent, high ranking DEX, native to the Fantom ecosystem. Since launch, we have had over 400 million in volume traded through our exchange, which we see as a respectable figure considering we are less than two months old.
Our community is rapidly growing, as does Fantom network usage and we only expect this to continue as Fantom is adopted as the preferred chain by the DeFi community due to its high TX throughput and immensely cheap transaction cost. Fantom chain is currently averaging half a million transactions per day. What we are proposing is an immense opportunity for the Cream Finance community to bridge and connect with a well engaged and extremely active community of DeFi enthusiasts on an ever growing network. The SpiritSwap team is extremely focused, resourceful, driven and eager to connect, partner and support other DeFi platforms on Fantom (and other chains as we integrate).

Vote action items
For: Add Spirit as collateral asset
Against: Do nothing

Additional details
Market cap: ~10m USD (70m USD prior to recent market downturn)
Token holders: ~19,335 unique addresses (FTM)

Token burn mechanism
On the 16th of May, SpiritSwap’s Team announced that a burn mechanism would be added to the Spirit protocol. The “0.05% fee” on every swap is currently used to buyback and burn SPIRIT. https://layer3.gitbook.io/spirit-swap//contracts
SpiritMaker buys back SPIRIT and sends it to the burn address (anyone can call the convert function to trigger a buy back burn).

inSPIRIT
inSPIRIT is the governance token of SpiritSwap that is based on a vote locking model. The main benefits for inSPIRIT users include:

A share in protocol profits
Boosted SPIRIT farming rewards
Voting power.

This model is based off veCRV from Curve Finance and DILL from Pickle Finance.
To get inSPIRIT, users must lock SPIRIT tokens for a user-defined timeframe. Users can lock their SPIRIT for any timeframe between 1 week to 4 years. Locking SPIRIT for a longer timeframe yields a larger amount of inSPIRIT. For example:

Locking 10 SPIRIT for 1 year yields 2.5 inSPIRIT.
Whereas, locking 10 SPIRIT for 4 years yields 10 inSPIRIT.

The amount of inSPIRIT slowly decreases in the users wallet until it reaches 0. This signifies that the lock period has ended and the user can withdraw their SPIRIT.
inSPIRIT is a non-transferrable token.
inSPIRIT Income
Protocol income is distributed to inSPIRIT holders. Protocol income comes from transaction fees (0.05% swap fee) on SpiritSwap. The protocol fees are used to buy-back SPIRIT and distribute it to inSPIRIT holders once a week.
inSPIRIT Boost
Users holding inSPIRIT get boosted SPIRIT farming rewards. Farmers that hold inSPIRIT can receive a max boost of up to 2.5x in farming rewards. For example, a farmer with no inSPIRIT could farm FTM-SPIRIT for 100% APR, while a farmer with sufficient inSPIRIT could reach an APR of 250%”.
inSPIRIT Vote
inSPIRIT holders vote on farm emission allocations and protocol governance.
1 inSPIRIT = 1 Vote
inSPIRIT holders can vote once a week on farm emission allocations. inSPIRIT holders can vote on protocol improvement proposals through snapshot governance.
Emissions

SPIRIT for farming and dev fund are emitted on a curve (4 years)
Airdrop and ecosystem fund will be emitted overtime (team will be conscious of supply dilution)
Dev fund has quarterly unlock for remaining tokens (team will be conscious of downward pressure)

Integrations, partnerships and collaborations in DeFi :
Partnership with the Fantom Foundation. Granted an audit to be carried our on SpiritSwap.
Coingeko - listing of both token and DEX.
CoinMarketCap - listing of both token and DEX.
DefiLima -  listing of both token and DEX.
Vfat -  integration with Vfat to give users a birds eye view of their DeFi activities and interactions across the SpiritSwap protocol.
Anyswap -  collaboration with Anyswap to offer cross chain support of SPIRIT token to BSC. This widens our reach to other chains, users and communities.
**There are a handful of other larger partnerships/integrations we have in store, however for preservation of IP and due to NDA’s these can not be disclosed at this time.

Community and Communication
SpiritSwap is active across Telegram and Discord for community management. The marketing team also operate on Medium and Twitter for outreach, marketing and PR. GitHub is up to date and can be found in resources links below.

Token Distribution
98,718,160 / 1,000,000,000 SPIRIT are currently in circulation. There is a further 74,171,475 SPIRIT minted (in reserve) for further airdrop allocation. However, once DAO is launched alongside inSPIRIT, we expect the community is going to vote to have this allocation burnt.


600,000,000 SPIRIT is to be farmed over a 4 year period (see emissions for more details).


200,000,000 SPIRIT will be reserved for the ecosystem, these tokens will primarily serve as grants to support the development and growth of both the SPIRIT and Fantom ecosystem.


100,000,000 SPIRIT reserved for airdrops (currently 26% of this has been distributed with potential for the remaining 74% to be burnt subject to DAO vote).


100,000,000 SPIRIT for team development funds (see emission schedule link).

['We need to list more tokens on BSC Cream'],"I’ve seen all the Proposal category and there has been no proposal for token listing on BSC yet. I use Cream BSC a lot. BSC defi is unique because you can lend and borrow coins like XRP, BCH, LTC, XTZ, ADA vs.
There are some other coins which we can list on cream like ONT, BAT,  MKR. These are very popular coins and available on BSC. It would be very beneficial for Cream.
Today ONTO wallet announced that they integrated Cream finance in their wallet. We can start with listing ONT token on the platform.

['We need to list more tokens on BSC Cream'],"When we list BAT and MKR, Cream will be the only platform on BSC where you can lend and borrow these coins. I think this will bring good amount of liquidity and attention to Cream.
You can lend ONT only on Fortube-BSC but I can’t trust that site.
I’m an arbitrage trader and I borrow all these coins to trade. Now I pay %18 interest on binance to borrow ONT. When we list ONT here, I’ll repay on Binance and borrow on Cream.
Like I said on my first post BSC defi is unique because you can lend and borrow non erc-20 tokens.
Cream is the only platform on BSC that I can trust and provide thousands of dollars of liquidity.

['Calling for CREAM Listing Committee Members'],"Now that that proposal to create a listing committee to deal with “light” proposals has passed, we need to elect Listing Committee Members.
For reference, this is my original proposal and this is the Snapshot vote for it. The original post goes into detail on the responsibilities of the listing committee
I briefly described in the post what I thought an ideal council would look like:

The 5 Nominees must have a diversified background to foster discussion while remaining flexible and agile to move fast. We believe that the ideal committee looks something like this:

2 C.R.E.A.M. Core Team members
2 active community members
1 lending protocol (other than C.R.E.A.M.) active contributor

This design was inspired by the Synthetix Spartan Council .

Ultimately this is just a suggestion and it’s up to the C.R.E.A.M. community who they think should serve on the Listing Committee.
I’m proposing that the initial election go like this:


Anyone who wants to be considered post a response to this thread with a candidacy statement, which should include a brief background, why they’re qualified, and why they want to serve. Totally fine if people want to remain anonymous, but they should still describe why they’re qualified.


One week from today - so May 28 - we initiate snapshot votes for each candidate. The five candidates with the most votes will serve on the initial committee.

“Uses the product” – actually uses CREAM, and will observe how the product behaves over time

Purely technical evaluation:   will token XYZ work with the smart contracts?   are there fee-with-transfer or balance-can-go-down issues that break the contracts?  do they comply with ERC20?

['Calling for CREAM Listing Committee Members'],"So guys, i just deleted my previous post cause i wanted to add more information:
I would like to nominate myself. Just that you know, im Michel Vaillant, very prominent Race Driver and known from many comics and an awesome TV Show from the 90ies.
But jokes aside, im an ETH and DEFI maximalist and truely believe, like most of us hopefully, that we are just creating the future of finance. I joined my crypto journey during the peak of 2017/2018 and was full invested in ETH until Defi Summer where i also invested in cream before the previous Liquidity Mining program started.
Now im a big yearn ecosystem enthusiast and around 60% of my portfolio is invested in the cream token and above 90% of my portfolio is sitting in cream as collateral. Wasnt the best decision cause the last drawdown hurt me quite much, but it is as it is. But what i can tell is that im very bullish on cream as a protocol and that we are extremly undervalued right now. Why?


1,5 billion TVL


around 100m MC


working product also during the last huge crash


Lending/Borrowing + staking + awesome partnerships (yearn, perp, bond, etc.)


very silent team which is shipping non stop, we have protocol updates every week (flash loans, collateral cap, new UI and hopefully some awesome tokenomics very soon)


we are on multiple chains already and im hoping that one day you can supply eth on eth’s L1 and borrow Stables or any other token on FTM or some L2 if you wish.


much more in the pipeline i hope 


This listing commitee is extremly important because right now we are lacking behind. As i mentioned in discord for quite some time, we need to move faster with token listings and determining collateral factors.
We are still the only lending/borrowing platform on FTM so we would have a first mover advantage, but sadly we dont have many coins there that you can supply or borrow and that is the first thing we have to do. Add Spirit, Boo, Link, Crv, woofy, any, etc and give them a suitable Collateral Cap and Factor.
Then we have to change some collateral factors on ETH and BSC aswell. We have some project listed with 0 collateral factor for quite some time. Just look at FTM, RAI, Ocean, RARI, SFI, ARMOR, MLN, UST, AKRO, SUSD etc. Thats TVL and fees we are missing cause we move so slow.
Best would be if the council could work on some guidelines. Like if the MC of a token is <10 Million, then x% collateral factor, from 10-50 Million x%, and so on.
So if you include or exclude me, i dont mind. But please go ahead and fix those simple things.
And what i hope the most is that we can find some kind of community. The discord server and gov forum is quite empty, i feel like im arguing alone and i hardly get any response to any topic. We need to get active community members and hopefully a more communicative team so we can get closer together and bring more people to this fantastic project and hard working team. If i can help with any task, please just write me im willing to help as good as possible ",20,68.8,2021-06-04

The Armor ecosystem: DeFi cover, reimagined.
Project Website: http://armor.fi/
Project Documentation: https://armorfi.gitbook.io/armor/
Armor is a coverage broker for DeFi, that offers PAYG coverage for smart contract bugs and attacks. All Armor coverage is underwritten by Nexus Mutual.

The benefit to the DeFi ecosystem and its users is that Armor coverage is:


Permissionless (Nexus requires KYC), and


Flexible with regard to coverage amounts and policy duration (“Pay as you Grow”).


The arCore Smart Cover System tracks user funds and allows cover that is based on the exact holdings, while being billed per second with no cancellation period.
The upcoming arShield product offers LP/Staking coverage that is paid directly from the LP/Staking rewards, offering secure staking for liquidity providers without any upfront costs.
arNXM and Armor Tokens
There are two tokens associated with the Armor project, ARMOR and arNXM

Armor is the governance token. A total of 1 billion ARMOR tokens are being distributed over two years 1: 65% to community members (including liquidity incentives, see note below), 35% to early team members with a 2-year vesting period.

The responsibilities for governance include:


Voting on updates to smart contract code


Voting on changes to constants used in the fee model (such as premium charge for buyers)


Voting on the exact time a hack took place


In addition, the token holders for the ArmorDAO may also vote to be given a share of the revenue made by the arCore Smart Cover and arShield systems.



arNXM is the yield bearing token for the arNXM vault.
The arNXM Vault accepts the Nexus Mutual wNXM/NXM tokens and puts it to work to produce yield. This is done by unwrapping and staking the wNXM (or NXM) tokens in the Nexus Mutual ecosystem.

Upon deposit of wNXM/NXM, users receive arNXM in return. arNXM can be traded freely, just like wNXM, but it also accrues staking rewards. arNXM produces yield in terms of the underlying token. Holders will arNXM will enjoy:


Additional yield from staking rewards (Currently ~40% APY)


Price appreciation as the price of underlying assets appreciates (wNXM/NXM)


Armor’s coverage for coverage providers’ for minimal risk staking

Benefits for Cream
Access to Armor’s User Base
Armor brings along with it a vibrant community of 7,000+ community members, across different social media platforms.
The community is highly engaged as in a little over a month, Armor already surpassed $1 billion USD in total cover amount, which has paid out premiums worth ~$5 million.
As of now, our ArCore smart cover system offers coverage in over 70 assets. As we increase our coverage purview, it will further drive up our ecosystem’s utility.
Increased TVL for Cream
This proposal will allow the CREAM TVL to expand and will allow the Armor community to borrow other assets against their $ARMOR/$arNXM tokens.
By setting the collateral factor of ARMOR and arNXM at 60% by default, it will help drive liquidity and TVL to the protocol. This will allow Armor and all its active users to lend through CREAM and drive up demand for borrowing assets.
As of writing, ~418,000 wNXM is locked up in the arNXM vault. The arNXM:NXM ratio has increased from 1.0 to 1.04. This translates to an APY of ~26.9% annualized over the underlying asset (NXM). arNXM has several times more liquidity than wNXM on most DEXes too, and will soon have even more when added to Bancor. The arNXM Vault also accounts for over 40% of staked NXM on Nexus Mutual.
CREAM: Combining Coverage and Lending
Besides developing an Armor and arNXM lending market, there are more interesting initiatives that we could develop with the CREAM community. We see an exciting future where we could potentially combine lending and coverage. This could be a huge win-win for both ARMOR and CREAM since it will enable CREAM users to leverage coverage on all tokens they borrow/lend from/to the protocol.
As Armor’s coverage purview grows, this collaboration could provide an easier bridge for newer protocols to enter Cream’s lending pool. Lenders and borrowers could safely interact with these tokens, knowing that they are backed by Armor coverage.
Another interesting collaboration prospect that might interest the Cream community is to mint ArNFTs (Armor’s non-fungible token wrapper for Nexus Mutual coverage) using the tokens they borrow → stake them in our ArNFT Staking Pools and earn yield through Armor’s Smart Cover System and Shield Vaults. In simple terms, earn yield through the tokens you borrow.
Armor and Cream are both uniquely positioned to capture this important niche and collaborating will be smart and efficient.

Increase Collateral Factor of arNXM to 60%
Summary
Increase collateral factor of arNXM to 60%
For

Increase collateral factor of arNXM to 60%

Against

Do nothing, which means stay at 0%

Motivation
It is important to raise collateral factor of newly listed assets with 0%. Both arNXM and ARMOR have very respectable liquidity across all Ethereum DEXes, plus recently passed a vote to add single sided liquidity listing on Bancor which will deepen liquidity even further to mitigate protocol downside risk.
With that considered, 60% is a reasonable collateral factor for arNXM and ARMOR. This provides great incentives for arNXM and ARMOR holders to supply in C.R.E.A.M. Finance, leading to higher TVL of the protocol and higher demand for borrowing assets.

Increase collateral factor of ARMOR to 60%
For

Increase collateral factor of ARMOR to 60%

Against

Do nothing, which means stay at 0%

Motivation
It is important to raise collateral factor of newly listed assets with 0%. Both arNXM and ARMOR have very respectable liquidity across all Ethereum DEXes, plus recently passed a vote to add single sided liquidity listing on Bancor which will deepen liquidity even further to mitigate protocol downside risk.
With that considered, 60% is a reasonable collateral factor for arNXM and ARMOR. This provides great incentives for arNXM and ARMOR holders to supply in C.R.E.A.M. Finance, leading to higher TVL of the protocol and higher demand for borrowing assets.

Motivation
It is important to raise collateral factor of newly listed assets with 0%. ARMOR has stable liquidity across Ethereum DEXes.
60% is a reasonable collateral factor for ARMOR. This provides great incentives for ARMOR holders to supply in C.R.E.A.M. Finance, leading to higher TVL of the protocol and higher demand for borrowing assets.
Memo on token distribution:

Currently 60% of supply is held by multisig. Soon a token holder led DAO will be implemented where approx 36.5% of supply is allocated to a dedicated gnosis safe wallet controlled via safesnap module governed by off-chain snapshot voting system. In addition a further 14.25% of the supply is allocated to token reward emissions. Armor currently runs the reward program via weekly distribution of tokens from the multisig (using synthetix contract). Armor is working on a new masterchef style reward distribution contract which works with already minted tokens (currently normal masterchef mints new tokens, doesn’t distributed already minted tokens). Once thats audited and live, Armor will also move all the reward emission token allocations to that special contract, as well as release the new masterchef contract as open source.

['Proposal: add aUSD as collateral asset (FTM)'],"Summary
We propose to list aUSD for lending and borrowing.
Token address: 0x41e3df7f716ab5af28c1497b354d79342923196a
For: Add aUSD to Cream listing/borroring
Against: Do nothing
Background
aUSD is a fully decentralized stablecoin backed by FTM as collateral. It is generated when users open a Trove in the Aquarius system and borrow against their FTM (akin to MakerDAO). All Troves must maintain a minimum collateral ratio of 110%, ensuring that aUSD is sufficiently backed by collateral.
Aquarius Key Facts

Top 10 DeFi project according to CoinGecko with $250M+ market cap on FTM network.
Aquarius has attracted an >$5M TVL, while aUSD has grown to a supply of >2.80M.
aUSD Token has $0.2M+ in trading volume
6k+ followers on Twitter & 1k+ on Telegram

Benefits to CREAM
Aquarius community has a big need to borrow and lend tokens. This almost guarantees a big trading volume. Aquarius also agreed to make a marketing campaign around that which Aquarius will take on with the Cream marketing team directly. There is an incentive program planned for people depositing or lending aUSD tokens on Cream which will be directly coordinated with the Cream team after listing.
Aquarius will get at least one of the 3 influencers talk (or write) about how Aquarius users can  maximize the utilization of Cream. This will be a great marketing for the Cream ecosystem as well.
Specification:
● aUSD is a fully decentralized stablecoin backed by FTM as collateral.
● aUSD maintains its peg through direct arbitrage opportunities. aUSD’s price floor of $1.00 is protected through a redemption mechanism. At any time, an aUSD holder can redeem aUSD against the system such that 1 aUSD = $1 of FTM. When aUSD is redeemed, it is used to pay off the debt of the riskiest Troves in the system in return for their collateral. When aUSD <$1, this is a profitable opportunity. Its price ceiling is protected by low collateral requirements, since a borrower can take out a loan at the 110% minimum and sell their aUSD on the market.",8,46.6,2021-06-07
['CREAM Staking on Bancor'],"Hello CREAM Community,
I am a long time user of the platform (lending collateral and borrowing against it) and even participated in some of the early liquidity mining campaigns. I wanted to create a topic in the forums to share a proposal Proposal: Whitelist C.R.E.A.M Finance Plus 400K BNT Co-Investment Limit that I put forth in the Bancor DAO to whitelist CREAM with a 400K BNT co-investment. This will allow CREAM holders to stake in the CREAM-BNT pool (if the proposal passes) single sided and also receive impermanent loss protection. The proposal is set to go live for voting in the Bancor DAO on Monday (5/3/21). It would be great for any BNT holders in the CREAN community (if you have voting power in the Bancor DAO) to show their support by voting on snapshot when this goes live next week.
For anyone not familiar with Bancor, there are two key features that differentiate it from other DEXes:

Single-Sided Exposure: LPs can provide liquidity to a pool with single-sided exposure, either in an ERC20 token (“TKN”) or in BNT.
Impermanent Loss Insurance: Impermanent Loss Insurance accrues over time, by 1% each day, until 100% protection is achieved after 100 days in the pool. There is a 30-day cliff, which means that if a liquidity provider decides to withdraw their position before 30 days passes, they’d incur the same IL loss experienced in a normal, unprotected AMM. If an LP withdraws any time after 100 days, they receive 100% compensation for any loss that occurred in the first 100 days, or anytime thereafter.

['Proposal: Add $FEI as a collateral asset'],"
Summary
FEI is a partially reserve-based algorithmic and scalable stablecoin. FEI has launched a new DeFi primitive in the form of protocol governed liquidity to create a new form of stablecoin asset. FEI is looking to create a new stablecoin that seeks to stabilize itself not via IOU-based debt commitments, rather through a monetary peg-based policy on the basis of protocol controlled reserves. FEI currently has $736 million in protocol controlled value. As a collateral asset, C.R.E.A.M could be one of the first lending protocols where much of the $595 million circulating FEI supply can be supplied or borrowed against it, and the opportunity to use the protocol-controlled value (736 million dollars) as liquidity.
Options for the proposal:
For: List FEI as a collateral asset on C.R.E.A.M.
FEI Token address: 0x956F47F50A910163D8BF957Cf5846D573E7f87CA
Against: Do nothing

Benefits to CREAM:
FEI holders have a need to lend/borrow, and the Fei DAO has the ability to provide liquidity to these pools using the Protocol Controlled Value of currently $736 million(~260k ETH). Fei plans to use PCV funds to enable the FEI DAO to set and manage interest rates in a lending market, and C.R.E.A.M could be the first to take advantage of this opportunity.
By adding FEI as a collateral asset, C.R.E.A.M will increase TVL and generate more usage.
The Fei team has committed to publicly marketing and promoting the CREAM suite of products (27k+ followers).

DeFi Integrations:
Uni V2: FEI-ETH and FEI-TRIBE have been the largest liquidity pairs on Uni V2 since its launch, with a 7-day volume of $581 million and $73 million.
Uni V3: FEI/USDC pools currently have $305 million 7 day volume
FEI circulating supply: $593 million

Token address: 0xcc4304a31d09258b0029ea7fe63d032f52e44efe
For: Add SWAP to Cream listing/borroring
Against: Do nothing
Background
TrustSwap is a full-service digital asset ecosystem focused on smart contract applications. The company’s flagship products are LaunchPads and Tokenlocks. The average performance of projects launching on TrustSwap is 1000% ROI making the token economics run very well. The main difference which TrustSwap has in comparison to other Launchpads is that its users have guaranteed allocations. The more tokens its user hold the bigger the allocation per user is. This gives users the incentive to take profits from their investments and buy more Swap.
There is a community push from TrustSwap users to be able to borrow more tokens to increase their Swapscore.
TrustSwap Key Facts

['Segment governance votes and create listing committee'],"
Summary
Written by Regan Bozman and Pierre Chuzeville from Dove Mountain Partners
C.R.E.A.M. should separate Critical Proposals from Light Proposals, and create a Committee that handles decision making for Light Proposals.
These two types of proposals would have different parameters which affect the length and execution of a proposal:

Critical proposals that affect would require more voting time and a higher vote differential.
Light proposals that affect asset listings and collateral requirements would require less voting time, can be quickly implemented - they should be delegated to a Listing Committee

As part of this change, we should also adopt Kiba’s proposal to create a Listing Committee and move all decisions around listing new assets and changing collateral requirements to this Listing Committee.
The Listing Committee will consist of 5 Nominees who are voted in by the CREAM token holders. Nominees should decide on Listings, Collateral Cap, Collateral Factors and Reserve Factors. This will enable much quicker governance decisions and also allow CREAM to avoid listing all new tokens as 0% collateral.
For

Create two types of proposals with different parameters which affect the length and execution of a proposal.
Create a C.R.E.A.M. Listing Committee

Against

Do nothing


Motivation
C.R.E.A.M. community members have voting fatigue because they need to approve small changes to the protocol. Currently, the governance forum is overloaded with requests related to assets listing and Collateral Factors. Consequently, critical proposals are lost among others.
The C.R.E.A.M. protocol development process is slowed down, participation rates are relatively low, and discussion is not encouraged enough. This is mainly due to a lack of structure, order and clarity, leading to a messy governance process.
Currently, the community votes on every Collateral Factor and new asset. This has a number of issues:

Creates voting fatigue for token holders because they’re asked to vote so frequently
Dilutes bigger governance changes

Creating a listing committee will make speed up new listings. The community can still make proposals for new assets to be added to C.R.E.A.M. platform. The proposal above attempts to balance speed of iteration with avoiding a descent into plutocracy. This will onboard more collateral to increase TVL and fees.

Specification
Light Proposals
Light proposals would include:

Asset Listing
Reserve Factors
Collateral Factors
Collateral Caps

What is included in governance proposals labeled as Light Proposals could evolve over time, and anyone is free to make suggestions.
Light proposals would be handled by a Listing Committee, who must make a binary decision. If YES wins (at least 3 positive votes), they have to reach an agreement on Reserve & Collateral Factors as well as Collateral Cap, within 2 days.
Critical proposals
They require more voting time, a higher vote differential, and are not handled by a specific Committee.
This is where the main strength of decentralized governance comes into play: community members should be able to express their opinion directly or at worst delegate their voting rights to trusted actors. Critical Proposals are the ones which must go through the full governance proposal lifecycle (we are planning to propose some updates here soon).
Listing Committee
The 5 Nominees must have a diversified background to foster discussion while remaining flexible and agile to move fast. We believe that the ideal committee looks something like this:

2 C.R.E.A.M. Core Team members
2 active community members
1 lending protocol (other than C.R.E.A.M.) active contributor

This design was inspired by the Synthetix Spartan Council.
Voting
Each Nominee would receive an NFT that gives him or her 1 vote. If enough voters amend their votes such that someone who is not a council member ranks higher than a council member, then the the DAO will manually retrieve the NFT from the departing Nominee and issue it to the new Nominee, giving them Nominee voting rights.
C.R.E.A.M. DAO will need to create a modified version (or custom contract) of an NFT which can be revoked and issued to EOA’s (Externally Owned Addresses), signifying a wallet is part of the Listing Committee.
Each parameter - Collateral Cap, Collateral Factor, and Reserve Factor - requires a minimum of three positive votes, in order to be listed. Nominees can also make proposals on new assets to list, and should discuss asset listing related community proposals in the forum.
Minimum proposal length is 24 hours and maximum is set to 5 days.
Election
Nominees election period would last 7 days, and would be renewed every 3 months. Existing Nominees from the current Listing Committee Epoch can remain on the Committee but will still be able to be voted out via people changing their votes in the poll.
In case of emergency, token holders can vote out a Nominee if the decisions made are not considered as aligned with the interests of C.R.E.A.M. Finance. The number of seats can be modified via an Improvements Proposal.
Limited Powers & DAO Discretion
The C.R.E.A.M. DAO has a veto power and can require a revote at its discretion, but this should happen only in emergency situations - the processes should all be optimized to minimize this potential occurrence.
Rewards
Assets listing, Collateral Cap, Reserve Factors and Collateral Factors are strategic parameters to ensure the longevity of the protocol. Such changes are highly related to downside risk of the whole protocol.
Therefore, Nominees need to be incentivized: they will get 25 CREAM tokens per month as rewards, which would vest over a 12-month period.",26,670.2,2021-05-12
['Segment governance votes and create listing committee'],"As protocol team member, I’m glad to see a proposal like that. This is the proposal that would bring a great improvement to our governance.
However, I have to point out the infeasibility before we move it to voting. As a matter of fact, Interest Rates are not decided by admin key directly. Borrow APY and Supply APY are decided by Interest Rate Model dynamically along with utilization rate on a block basis.
It is technically impossible to empower the Listing Committee to decide Interest Rates.
Thus, if we are going to empower Listing Committee the right to decide Interest Rate Model, the committee must be capable of building one, or be capable of understanding / deciphering the math model at least.
Also, as discussed with @Kiba, I suggest that the committee decide Reserve Factors by setting Reserve Factor for each token category (Major, Stable, Governance token), rather than setting Reserve Factor to new asset one by one. Of course the committee could make exception for any asset with a good reason, but it makes more sense to provide a consistent and predictable Reserve Factor basis in the protocol.",17,73.4,2021-05-07
['Segment governance votes and create listing committee'],"Hi @eason, I like that way you have proposed for the Reserve Factor for each token category and would like to add to it in terms of collateral factor for assets.
When a particular asset gets listed in a particular token category, we can start with a certain percentage per category by allocation certain rules(Number of token holders, marketcap etc…)
For example: Governance tokens of projects with over 4000 holders and 300M marketcap starts with 15% Collateral factor.
I could be wrong in my approach, looking forward to feedbacks.",16,53.2,2021-05-07

['Proposal: Add WSCRT as a collateral asset on CREAM Ethereum'],"Summary :
Proposal by Secret Network community member SCRTisland
This proposal would add WSCRT (Wrapped Secret) as a collateral asset on CREAM Ethereum.
Motivation :
Wrapped Secret (WSCRT) allows ethereum users to bridge between the world of ERC20 tokens into the privacy-preserving Secret Network tokens and back at a 1:1 rate. This allows bi-directional flow of many assets to take advantage of Secret Network’s privacy tokens, including adding CREAM as a secret version to our network as secretCREAM.
Background:
Secret Network is the first blockchain with privacy-preserving smart contracts. That means applications built on Secret can utilize encrypted data without revealing it to anyone, even the nodes in the network. For the first time, Secret Network allows developers to build powerful, permissionless, privacy-preserving applications - Secret Apps.
Secret is the native coin of the Secret Network, a decentralized network for private / secure computation. Nodes on the network (known as secret nodes) can perform generalizable computations over encrypted data, which allows smart contracts (known as secret contracts) to use private and sensitive data as inputs. WSCRT is the wrapped version of SCRT which allows a 1:1 bridge from SCRT to WSCRT.
All assets bridged to the Secret Network are minted using SNIP-20 (ERC-20 like contract based token issuance) standard. All SNIP-20s are privacy tokens as secret contracts are full encrypted (input, state, output). These secretTokens can be swapped on SecretSwap with front-running and miner-extractable value (MEV) resistance. This is again possible given the encrypted nature of SNIP-20 tokens.

Benefits for CREAM:
First mover advantage - no competition on SCRT borrowing / lending

Yield opportunities for CREAM community through borrowing SCRT: CREAM users can participate in SCRT related yield opportunities (SCRT staking), SushiSwap Onsen without acquiring SCRT.
Access to SCRT community through SCRT lending: CREAM will become the first platform to offer borrowing and lending of SCRT. Secret Network community is extremely strong, vocal and eager to support related projects. This listing would bring a strong influx of new users, who would use SCRT as collateral to participate in ETH DeFi.
TVL potential: the total economic value available in SecretNetwork is approximately $600mn
Potential to add aToken to the Secret Bridge to create wrapped aTokens with privacy. aTokens can be added to the Secret Network bridge if needed by the CREAM community)

Benefits for Secret Network Community:

Ability to borrow / lend WSCRT and participate in leveraged ETH DeFi.
Awareness gain among Ethereum DeFi users for the front-running resistant DeFi ecosystem Secret Network is building.

Risk Mitigation:
Secret Network has been live on mainnet for more than 1 year. SecretTokens have been tested thoroughly in production since October 2020. There is ~$80mn worth of Secret Tokens minted, which was used by +6,000 unique users with more than 50K computations. Secret Network Ethereum bridge has been live since December 2020, used by 2,200 unique users. Currently the bridge provides privacy to $75mn worth of Ethereum assets.

I’m upvoting this because I bought Enigma some years ago because I firmly believe in privacy and think Secret (SCRT) would make a great adittion to CREAM. They’re bridging ETH and SNIP tokens, with future coming BSC bridges too.
FutureSwap is working pretty well running with low fees.It surely will help bridge assets to Cream ETH with as much privacy, permissionless contracts, as crypto users could ask.
I think the 2 projects (CREAM and SCRT) synergyze greatly.
But dont take it from me alone, DYOR and you could even get an airdrop for Secrets governance token (SEFI) if you go deep enought into the rabbit hole.

['Proposal: Add WSCRT as a collateral asset on CREAM Ethereum'],"Having access to WSCRT on CREAM would be a great opportunity to introduce the possibility of borrowing / lending to the Secret Network users. SCRT is used to pay all fees on the Secret Network and acts as it’s governance token.
The most interesting aspect of this project is ‘programmable privacy’, in short this means that you can create smart contracts that can be completely private (input, internal state, and output). This is possible because everything runs inside a Trusted Execution Environment, where everything is hidden, even from the validators hosting the node.
sTokens, the Secret Network version of ERC-20s, are by default private and account balances can only be viewed when you have set a viewing key. This enables you to share certain information with others, if you would wish to do so, without compromising control over your wallet while retaining general privacy. This is essential to a lot of different use cases on blockchains which require some form of privacy.
Regarding sustainability, the network is PoS so the electricity requirements are significantly lower than PoW. What keeps this project running though is SCRT’s community. They come together several times a week in public meetings that can be attended by anyone. In these meetings developers and enthusiasts alike discuss both short and long term goals, and ways to achieve them. It isn’t uncommon to see 40 to 50 attendees in the less technical meetings.
In the near future there are some interesting things coming up: a bridge to BSC, the launch of SEFI (Governance token of SecretSwap, a front-running resistant AMM running on the Secret Network), and the creation of secret NFTs.

['Proposal: Add WSCRT as a collateral asset on CREAM Ethereum'],"Privacy will be a big trend in the future, An example of this is the rise in OTC market operations that many large companies use, nobody wants all their movements on the Blockchain to be known, well Secret Network solves this problem, allowing programming of smart contracts with encrypted data, with its Secret Token it combines the programmability of the ERC20 with the privacy of Zcash or Monero. What are the advantages of interacting with Secret Network:

High commissions for using ERC-20 token: This is something that I particularly liked a lot, especially in the last time, using its bridge you can pass your erc-20 to the Snip-20 standard, with which to make the commissions for using Their platform equates to pennies on the dollar which helps retailers like me a lot.

Big costs of using AMM like Uniswap? Secret network has already launched SecretSwap, where you can interact with all the most popular secret tokens such as sLink, sEth, sOcean, among many others, making swaps, even providing liquidity. It is also something that I have taken advantage of lately to be a candidate for their $ GOV Governance Token Airdrop this March.
Today we can all see the NFT boom for which a new secret grant has been awarded to develop a non-fungible token (NFT) standard for the Secret Network, which unlocks new critical and unique use cases for NFT. with programmable privacy.

Summary
I think it’s a good idea to add Paxos Gold (PAXG) as collateral to CREAM finance platform. PAXG is issued by a reputable company (Paxos) and is backed 1-1 by physical gold. The usage and trading volumes have expoded over the past month. No lending platform has listed PAXG yet and CREAM could be the first one.
For

Add Paxos Gold (PAXG) as a collateral asset

Against

“Do nothing”


Motivation
No collateral on this planet is more stable than the physical gold.
PAXG is backed 1-1 by allocated physical gold in a vault. It is managed by Paxos. Paxos runs a big exchange - itBit. Paxos manages crypto stuff for PayPal’s. PAXG is widely considered safe. It can be priced to the liquid Binance market or global gold market because it’s backed 1-1 by physical gold. Maker DAO has already voted in PAXG as collateral but they are still waiting till it’s implemented. CREAM could be faster.
There are millions of dollars posted as collateral on CREAM while FED keeps destroying their value. Being able to post gold as collateral, with literally 0 fees for holding PAXG tokens backed by gold in the vaults, would be an attractive alternative. I am not aware of any other platform that holds gold in a vault for you and doesn’t charge yearly fees.

Background
contract address:
0x45804880de22913dafe09f4980848ece6ecbaf78
Current market cap: $249m
24 Hour Trading Vol reported by Coingecko: $24m

Specification
There is a small complication in the form of the 0.02% fee on each transfer (“fee on transfer” ERC20).

['Proposal: C.R.E.A.M. and UMA KPI Options'],"
Summary
This proposal explores a potential collaboration between CREAM and UMA to create a bespoke series of KPI options. The purpose of this early outreach is to assess potential interest from CREAM’s community. If there is interest, CREAM and the Super UMAns - a dedicated group within UMA’s community - can work further to refine which KPIs and adresses would be optimal for a KPI options drop.
For: Dedicate time to explore KPI options initiative, to identify which KPIs and addresses should be included in a potential KPI options drop
Against: Do not explore this opportunity

Motivation
Why would KPI options be a great fit for CREAM?
Growth. CREAM already has so many financial tools. UMA believes KPI options can be a natural next step for growing CREAM’s community and optimizing the KPIs you would like to focus most on.
In March UMA completed an airdrop of 1 million KPI options (uTVL-0621) to 7135 addresses that had participated in  UMA protocol in one way or another, as well as governance for other protocols. These options would gain some value based UMA’s TVL. Based on a linear scale, their minimum value would be 0.1 UMA, but if the goal of 2B TVL was hit by 06/21 each option could be worth up to 2 UMA - a significant payout for everyone involved.
The effects of UMA’s KPI options drop were relevant across 2 dimensions:

Birth of the SuperUMAn community with people from all over flocking in to get involved with UMA. This created an abundance of outside human resources with many talents to fill out a roster of probably the most diverse and talented team in DeFi today. These SuperUMAns with the help of UMAs core team members make quite a force in the DeFi community.
Growth in TVL. After an original 72m TVL upon launch in 2 months it reached 221m, with many new integrations and collaborations still in UMA’s pipeline.

Risks and concerns for CREAM and its community.
The Ecosystem fund would lock up CREAM tokens into UMA’s audited contracts to mint KPI option tokens; UMAs contracts have been Audited by Open Zeppelin. After expiry, tokens are redeemable for an amount decided on by the community. Any unused tokens will be refunded to CREAM’s treasury.

UMA’s Proposal
The UMA protocol proposes to the CREAM community the creation of KPI options to help with growth in key areas they would like to see grow. This is a highly tailored and flexible product where CREAM would be able to define all variables of the drop, particularly:

Decide which metrics will be used for KPI options
Choose a start and expiry date for the KPI options
Choose a name for KPI options, so it can be identified in an UMIP (UMA improvement proposal)
Decide amount to be distributed (and/or held back for later distribution)
Decide which wallets should receive the options.

To move forward, we propose that CREAM gets in touch with UMA when the community is ready. UMA has a group of UMIP coaches ready to help you every step along the way, as well as answer any questions that may arise. UMA is looking forward to working with CREAM.

Reminder: Borrow Limit Used including the value of your borrowed asset along with the borrow interest.



Q3: When will liquidation occur?

When a wallet’s Borrow limit is exceeded(Borrow Limit Used over 100%), anyone can permissionlessly repay loans at a discount in return for the underlying collateral assets. (=Liquidation)
This discount incentive for the liquidators ensures that debt remains fully collateralized, reducing systemic risk.
According to the Comptroller contract, the liquidation incentive is 1.08 and the close factor is 0.5. This means that each liquidation calls can liquidate half of the collateral and the bonus liquidator can get is 8%.

Summary
Define the C.R.E.A.M. governance process. From idea to implementation, including days per stage, key stakeholders, quorum, and thresholds.


C.R.E.A.M. Governance Request: someone posts an open question in governance forums. The forum post should include a link to the associated Snapshot poll. IF PASSES THEN:


C.R.E.A.M. Improvement Proposal: a CIP (C.R.E.A.M. Improvement Proposal) is then created. IF PASSES THEN:


Execution: a two-day Timelock period before proposed code is executed


As part of these changes, we also proposing lowering the C.R.E.A.M. balance needed to submit a Governance Request or Improvement Proposal to 250 CREAM.
For

Implement a 3-step governance proposal lifecycle from idea to implementation with specific parameters settings, while also lowering the C.R.E.A.M. balance needed to propose Governance Requests and Improvement Proposals.

Against

Do nothing


Motivation
Currently, there is no clearly defined governance proposal lifecycle. This decreases community participation in governance. Most other Tier 1 DeFi protocols have adopted a well thought governance process to foster innovation and community participation.
Additionally, the $CREAM required to propose a vote is too high – it’s currently well over $100,000, pricing out many active community members

Specification
Several governance venues are available to C.R.E.A.M. governance, each serving its own particular purpose.

forum.cream.finance is a Discourse-hosted forum for governance-related discussion.

Snapshot is a simple voting interface that allows users to signal sentiment. Votes on snapshot are weighted by the number of CREAM delegated to the address used to vote.

[1] C.R.E.A.M. Governance Request (CGR) — Discourse/Snapshot
The purpose of the CGR is to determine if there is sufficient will to make changes to the status quo.
To create a CGR:

Ask a general, non-biased question to the community in the CGR Discussion on forum.cream.finance about a potential change (example: ”Should C.R.E.A.M. implement EPNS decentralized notifications?”). Forum posts should be labeled as follows: ”First Check - [Your Title Here]”. The forum post should include a poll in it.
CGR posts should be labeled as follows: ”CGR - [Your Title Here]”
Voters use Snapshot to indicate their interest in bringing it forward to the next stage.

Snapshot poll lengths should be set to 2 days.
Quorum: At the end of the 2 days, a majority vote with a 15k CREAM yes-vote threshold wins.
If the First Check does not suggest a change from the status quo, the topic will be closed on the governance site.

[2] C.R.E.A.M. Improvement Proposal (CIP) — Discourse/Snapshot
The proposal should be based on the winning outcome from the CGR and can consist of one or multiple actions, up to a maximum of 10 actions per proposal.
To create a CIP:


Create a topic in the Proposal Discussion category on forum.cream.finance titled ”CIP — [Your Title Here]” and link to any relevant Snapshot polls/discussion threads as well as the code audit report. Topics that begin with ”CIP” that have not successfully passed through the First Check stages will be removed by moderators.


Use feedback from the First Check post and create a new Snapshot poll which covers the options which have gained support. This poll can either be binary or multiple choice but you are required to include the option ”Make no change” or its equivalent. Set the poll duration to 5 days.


Make sure that the discussion thread links to the new Snapshot poll and the First Check thread


Reach out to your network to build support for the proposal. Discuss the proposal and actively solicit delegates to vote on it. Be willing to respond to questions. Share your view point, although try to remain as impartial as possible.


Users must have 250 CREAM in their wallet in order to submit a vote.


The voting period should be coupled with communications of CIPs via Twitter and Discord.
Quorum: At the end of the 5 days, a majority vote with a 40k CREAM yes-vote threshold wins.
If the Snapshot vote does not meet a 50% majority approval then the vote is rejected and no changes will be enacted.
Authors of proposals that are rejected may resubmit their proposal, but should include significant changes that address issues that may have prevented the CIP from passing during the initial vote.

[3] Execution

If the proposal has passed successfully, a two day timelock will follow before the proposed code is executed.

Besides, since we have multisig already, I don’t see the benefit of putting time lock here. What’s the rationale behind? Time lock is more decentralized, but it also deprive protocol of the ability to react to emergent situation in a timely manner. I would say C.R.E.A.M.

1/ Two phase voting - you’re right that my proposed plan may complicate the governance process. The reason that I proposed it is that I think it’s useful to do a soft poll on people’s opinions before moving stuff to a formal vote.
So an alternative is to just have people include a poll in their proposals in the governance forums and people can indicate interest right within forum.cream.finance.
This is how we run governance in the Index Coop and it has worked well.

['Define and implement a 3-step governance'],"I’ve updated the specification based on helpful feedback from @eason and @Kiba. This was the original specification:

Specification
Several governance venues are available to C.R.E.A.M. governance, each serving its own particular purpose.

forum.cream.finance is a Discourse-hosted forum for governance-related discussion.

Snapshot is a simple voting interface that allows users to signal sentiment. Votes on snapshot are weighted by the number of CREAM delegated to the address used to vote.

[1] C.R.E.A.M. Governance Request (CGR) — Discourse/Snapshot
The purpose of the CGR is to determine if there is sufficient will to make changes to the status quo.
To create a CGR:

Ask a general, non-biased question to the community in the CGR Discussion on forum.cream.finance about a potential change (example: ”Should C.R.E.A.M. implement EPNS decentralized notifications?”). Forum posts should be labeled as follows: ”First Check - [Your Title Here]”. The forum post should include a poll in it.
CGR posts should be labeled as follows: ”CGR - [Your Title Here]”
Voters use Snapshot to indicate their interest in bringing it forward to the next stage.

Snapshot poll lengths should be set to 2 days.
Quorum: At the end of the 2 days, a majority vote with a 15k CREAM yes-vote threshold wins.
If the First Check does not suggest a change from the status quo, the topic will be closed on the governance site.
[2] C.R.E.A.M. Improvement Proposal (CIP) — Discourse/Snapshot
The proposal should be based on the winning outcome from the CGR and can consist of one or multiple actions, up to a maximum of 10 actions per proposal.
To create a CIP:

Create a topic in the Proposal Discussion category on forum.cream.finance titled ”CIP — [Your Title Here]” and link to any relevant Snapshot polls/discussion threads as well as the code audit report. Topics that begin with ”CIP” that have not successfully passed through the First Check stages will be removed by moderators.
Use feedback from the First Check post and create a new Snapshot poll which covers the options which have gained support. This poll can either be binary or multiple choice but you are required to include the option ”Make no change” or its equivalent. Set the poll duration to 5 days.
Make sure that the discussion thread links to the new Snapshot poll and the First Check thread
Reach out to your network to build support for the proposal. Discuss the proposal and actively solicit delegates to vote on it. Be willing to respond to questions. Share your view point, although try to remain as impartial as possible.
Users must have 250 CREAM in their wallet in order to submit a vote.

The voting period should be coupled with communications of CIPs via Twitter and Discord.
Quorum: At the end of the 5 days, a majority vote with a 40k CREAM yes-vote threshold wins.
If the Snapshot vote does not meet a 50% majority approval then the vote is rejected and no changes will be enacted.
Authors of proposals that are rejected may resubmit their proposal, but should include significant changes that address issues that may have prevented the CIP from passing during the initial vote.
[3] Execution

If the proposal has passed successfully, a two day timelock will follow before the proposed code is executed.

['Proposal: Add $COTI as a collateral asset on CREAM Ethereum'],"Hi CREAM community!
This is a proposal to request the addition of $COTI to CREAM as a collateral asset.
COTI is a fully encompassing “Finance on the blockchain” ecosystem, specifically designed to meet the challenges of both centralized finance (fees, latency, global inclusion and risk) and Decentralized Finance DeFi (fees, clogging and complexity) by introducing a new type of DAG based base protocol and infrastructure that is scalable, fast, private, inclusive, low cost and is optimized for finance.
For
$COTI token is added to CREAM as a collateral asset.
Against
$COTI token is not added.
Motivation
Strong demand for holding this token makes it an excellent choice as a collateral asset.
– CREAM Finance would become the first protocol to allow the collateral use of $COTI.
– Currently almost 10,000 holders just in ERC20, in addition to more than 10,000 native token holders, circulating supply is 670M of 2,000M total, market cap is $230M.
– Primarily traded on Binance, in addition to 16 other exchanges, large daily trading volume of nearly $150M (out of which $100M just in Binance).
Key highlights on COTI:

COTI has already been adopted by close to 200 merchants and big players: Dafabet, Kindred Group, Unibet, Microgaming, Jet Bingo, 10bet and many more.
The monthly volume of merchant processing has already reached over $23.1M USD in March 2021 and it’s growing.
COTI has partnered with Cardano to offer an ADA payment processing solution for merchants, AdaPay, which was recently launched on Shelley Mainnet
cFUND, the Cardano ecosystem venture fund made its first VC investment in COTI
COTI has partnered with Simplex, a principle partner of VISA, to allow COTI users access to bank accounts and debit cards to spend funds in crypto in physical or online stores
COTI developed the Crypto Volatility Index (CVI) a revolutionary and first-of-its-kind decentralized Crypto Volatility Index for the crypto market. The CVI allows users to hedge themselves against market volatility and impermanent loss.

$COTI token address is 0xddb3422497e61e13543bea06989c0789117555c5 on the Ethereum mainnet.",8,31.6,2021-05-13

['Proposal: Raise collateral factor of new yVault tokens to 75%'],"
Summary
This proposal would increase the collateral factor of yvCurve-IronBank, yvCurve-sETH, and yvCurve-stETH to 75%.

Motivation
As detailed in this proposal, there are plans to add several of Yearn’s v2 yVault tokens to C.R.E.A.M. v1. As the first three of these assets have now gone live for borrowing and lending, the next logical step is to allow users to collateralize their vault tokens and borrow against them. This will bring greater TVL to C.R.E.A.M. and also drive borrowing demand, increasing returns to depositors and to the protocol itself.

Background
C.R.E.A.M. currently has two v1 yVault tokens listed as collateral—yUSD and yETH, both listed at 75% collateral ratio. Thus, this proposal matches the current standard by allowing 75% collateral ratio, and also recognizes the stability of assets denominated in USD and ETH that are also yield-bearing. Furthermore, this proposal acts in continuation of the previously announced merger between C.R.E.A.M. and Yearn and the milestones that were outlined.
Yearn Finance is an aggregator service for decentralized finance (DeFi) investors, using automation to allow them to maximize profits from yield farming. Yearn is currently the 2nd largest yield protocol (in TVL ranking - source: Defi Llama) and the 15th largest DeFi protocol overall (in TVL ranking - source: Defi Llama).
For
Increase collateral factor of yvCurve-IronBank, yvCurve-sETH, and yvCurve-stETH to 75%.
Against

Difficulty in liquidation is directly linked to the protocol risk. Thus, we think 60% is a proper number.

['Increase Collateral Factor of DPI to 75% + List DPI/ETH LPs_'],"
Summary
Increase DPI collateral factor from C4 (45%) to C6 (75%)
List DPI/ETH liquidity pool tokens from Uniswap and Sushiswap

Motivation
Since listing DP its TVL has increased by 15x to over $200M and liquidity by 5x to $100M on Uniswap v2. CREAM currently has pretty good penetration into DPI market with $5M of DPI on the platform today. However there is a proposal on Aave to list DPI with 50% LTV (higher than current CREAM market) that is likely to pass because DPI controls 65k AAVE tokens to vote in governance. If we do nothing, we will lose our lead in the market for the biggest index in crypto.

Description
DPI has become a mainstay of DeFi ecosystem now being referenced by almost all publications as a reference for the entire market (see Bloomberg). Majority of it’s growth comes without token incentives unlike all of it’s competitors and it has very sticky users (retention analysis) which means once we get DPI users into CREAM they are likely to stay and keep using our platform. There is also a Chainlink oracle for DPI/USD which has been operational since end of last year.
On top of the $100M DPI/ETH liquidity, since DPI is a fully collateralized index token it can be redeemed for its underlying tokens (YFI, UNI, AAVE, etc.) which are all highly liquid themselves. So for the purposes of liquidations the effective liquidity of DPI is the sum of all underlying token liquidity + DPI/ETH liquidity.
For example on Matcha.xyz for a 200 ETH order, dumping DPI has less slippage than dumping YFI (before taking into account that you can redeem and dump individual tokens instead of DPI directly)

Screen Shot 2021-05-12 at 4.50.14 PM768×926 66.5 KB

(we are also working on getting sDPI from synthetix and listing on Curve for even deeper liquidity but that’s nowhere near done yet, just a heads up)
Because of it’s liquidity, price feed, and position leading the market as the biggest index in crypto I propose we upgrade its collateral ratio to C6 (75%) in the “Major and Stables” category.
About 25% of all DPI is locked up in Uniswap liquidity so we should also list LP tokens as well since Aave AMM market is now live and might list these tokens soon. So to capture the entire DPI market I propose we list DPI/ETH LP tokens from Uni and Sushi.
For

Increase DPI collateral factor to 75% and list DPI/ETH LPs

Against

Do nothing


P.S.
Not really important for this proposal but listing LPs should also drive DPI/ETH liquidity from Uni to our partner Sushi because if you aren’t using your Uni LP tokens to farm INDEX tokens you might as well migrate to SLP and earn SUSHI while you are lending/leveraging on CREAM.",11,182.2,2021-05-13
['Increase Collateral Factor of DPI to 75% + List DPI/ETH LPs_'],"Strongly in favor. DPI is on the roadmap for both AAVE, Maker, and others. It is incredibly liquid as are its components.

['Proposal: Add vBTC as a collateral asset on ETH and BSC'],"
Summary
Developed by Keno, now lead core developer at Sushiswap, and Johann Barbie, currently lead Strudel dev, the Strudel protocol is the first one-way, trustless bridge linking Bitcoin and other centralized assets to the Ethereum blockchain.
Our main competitor, wrapped BTC (wBTC), with a market cap of 8 billion USD, uses a multisig setup capped to around half a dozen signers. This means that that there is a real risk that signers could collude and remove the underlying value of the protocol.
Our other competitor is REN. However, REN uses a “trust-minimized” approach and is capital-inefficient since you need to put up more collateral than value you are wrapping. This means that you would need more value than the total value of bitcoins to be able to wrap them, making it un-scalable. REN relies on custodial control of multisig keys, whereas Strudel is trustless. Compared to other wrapping options in the market, Strudel’s trustless nature and low marketcap allows for considerable growth potential.
vBTC is currently traded on Sushiswap (primary) and Uniswap.
BarterTrade listing pending.
Top 10 CEX listing in negotiation.
For

The effect of “Add vBTC as a collateral asset”

Against

“Dont add vBTC as a collateral asset”


Motivation
vBTC is a bitcoin that you can collateralize, yield farm with, lend, etc. It is certainly possible that the protocol is never widely adopted. Which is a potential downside/negative.

['Increase Collateral Factor of RAI to 45%'],"
Summary
This proposal would increase the collateral factor of RAI to 45% (tier C4).

Motivation
RAI has been eligible for depositing into, and available for borrowing from Cream for two months. As one of the first partners that Reflexer had, Cream has been added to the rewards program meant to encourage RAI activity on secondary markets.
Currently, the Reflexer community is eagerly waiting to use RAI and borrow other assets against it while taking advantage of RAI’s embedded rate. This proposal is a first step in this direction as well as a way to further boost usage in the RAI Cream market.

Background
RAI is an asset backed only by ETH, governance-minimized, and programmed to maintain its own price stability without needing to peg to an external price reference like the USD. You can check RAI’s performance in the past months as well as the current integrations on Dune.

['Proposal: Add INV as a collateral asset on CREAM Ethereum'],"Summary
Hello CREAM community!
This is a proposal to request the addition of INV to CREAM as a collateral asset.
INV is the Inverse.Finance governance token.
For

The INV token is added to CREAM as a collateral asset.

Against

The INV token is not added.

Motivation

Strong demand for holding this token makes it an excellent choice as a collateral asset.
– CREAM Finance would become the first protocol to allow the collateral use of INV.
– Currently 2068 holders, circulating supply is 38,074 / 100,000, market cap is $43,000,000.
– Primarily trades on Uniswap. Large trading volume ~$6m in 24 hours (INV-ETH pool).
– Holders accumulating INV can participate in the governance of the Inverse.Finance DAO.

Background
INV is the governance token of Inverse.Finance, a growing ecosystem of financial protocols including:


DCA Vaults: passive no-loss investment in any token by following a Dollar-Cost Averaging strategy using stablecoin yield.

['Add BasketDAO DeFi Index ($BDI) as a collateral asset to CREAM market'],"Summary:
BDI is an index launched by BasketDAO that holds yield bearing blue chip tokens.
Adding BDI as collateral to CREAM will give us a lower volatility collateral asset, allow BDI holders to leverage their position, and allow CREAM holders to hedge bluechip DeFi exposure.
What is BDI:
Token address: https://etherscan.io/token/0x0309c98b1bffa350bcb3f9fb9780970ca32a5060
BDI is the first product by BasketDAO, a decentralised index provider. First launched as BDPI, and then later rebranded as BDI, BDI is a DeFi index that holds bluechip tokens. Its largest holdings are UNI, AAVE and MKR. Where possible, BDI farms yield safely to maximize capital efficiency and make the most out of the money legos it holds. BDI also does not charge management fees.
BDI aims to be the premier index for DeFi, and the aim is to build an entire suite of products around BDI.
BDI stats:

56M BDI AUM
52M BDI-ETH liquidity on sushiswap
3M daily trading volume

Why should BDI be added:
The majority of the assets in BDI are already on CREAM.
Long term BDI holders will use CREAM to borrow other assets against their BDI holdings. Traders will be able to use CREAM to put on leveraged or short BDI positions.
BDI is an index, so it has lower volatility than its constituent tokens, meaning it is theoretically a lower risk collateral.
This will also enable the creation of more new BDI related products in the future that can supply TVL and be built on top of the CREAM infrastructure.
Proposal:


For: Add BDI to CREAM at a collateral factor of 0% (Increase will go through a second proposal)


Against: Do nothing

['Proposal: Add support for mAssets from Mirror Protocol on CREAM Ethereum'],"Hello, I’m a community member from the Mirror Protocol ecosystem. I’m posting today regarding support for the following synthetic assets from Mirror (mAssets):

mTSLA: https://etherscan.io/token/0x21ca39943e91d704678f5d00b6616650f066fd63

mTWTR: https://etherscan.io/token/0xedb0414627e6f1e3f082de65cd4f9c693d78cca9

mVIXY: https://etherscan.io/token/0xf72fcd9dcf0190923fadd44811e240ef4533fc86

mIAU: https://etherscan.io/token/0x1d350417d9787e000cc1b95d70e9536dcd91f373

mMSFT: https://etherscan.io/token/0x41bbedd7286daab5910a1f15d12cbda839852bd7


I chose these specific mAssets to start with because these are the top 5 mAssets by liquidity on Ethereum (Source: https://info.uniswap.org/token/0xa47c8bf37f92abed4a126bda807a7b7498661acd). They also represent a mix of different asset types: US equities (TSLA, TWTR, MSFT), commodities (IAU), and ETF (VIXY).
Each of these assets have UST pairs on Uniswap with ~17M of liquidity, which I believe is more than sufficient.

Motivation

I believe creating borrow/lend markets for these equity synthetic assets would be extremely interesting; it would allow CREAM to “look outward” and provide a use case outside of pure crypto assets
These assets are the most liquid of all mAssets, and I believe sufficient time has passed for Mirror Protocol to prove its resilience (5 months)
Support of these assets will expand the TVL of CREAM
If this proves to be successful, it will open up the floodgates for borrowing/lending of synthetics, and would position CREAM as the leading protocol in this arena


Background
mAssets are synthetic assets from Mirror Protocol (https://mirror.finance/). Mirror is a DeFi protocol powered by smart contracts on the Terra network that enables the creation of synthetic assets called Mirrored Assets (mAssets). mAssets mimic the price behavior of real-world assets and give traders anywhere in the world open access to price exposure without the burdens of owning or transacting real assets.
At the time of this writing, Mirror has $2B in value locked within the protocol, and does ~$40M in daily volume. Mirror Assets are live on the Terra blockchain, Ethereum, and Binance Smart Chain.

How Price oracle works: Mirrored Assets (mAssets) - mirror",15,353.0,2021-04-18
['Proposal: Add support for mAssets from Mirror Protocol on CREAM Ethereum'],"Disclaimer: Before I begin, I must state that I am new to Cream Finance governance- I am an avid Mirror user and hold a lot of stocks on Mirror platform. So my views may be biased!
I believe that this partnership is a no-brainer, in-fact it’s a match made in heaven for variety of reasons:
Future of financial markets: I believe that addition of mAssets to a lending-borrowing protocol like Cream Finance is a natural progression of evolution of stock markets. Enabling lending and borrowing of stocks like Twitter and Tesla has potential to unlock value for global investors in a way that traditional finance has not seen till date.
Yield for holding stocks: Imagine holding Twitter stock (mTWTR) on Cream and lending it on Cream for 3% lending yield (getting yields higher than dividends on a fast growing stock would be mind-boggling for major investors)- that’s what blockchain can do.
Leverage trading on stocks: Imagine if someone had power to long TSLA (mTSLA) stocks with leverage at such a cheap cost - I know several retail and marquee investors who wanted to take a leveraged bet on Tesla in 2019/2020 but could never do it because of lack of avenues to do so. This low cost, low-barrier possibility could only happen when stocks come on blockchain. If you are not an Elon Musk, no bank today will accept your Tesla stock as collateral and give you capital on behalf of it (think about how huge this is!!)
New capital inflow and user base for Cream: Mirror has a TVL of over $2bn and its users are not just retail audience but also several funds in crypto and non-crypto space. Being the first protocol to enable lending and borrowing on mAssets (mirrored stocks), Cream would naturally attract a new unique user base and fresh capital resulting in a solid potential boost-up of TVL for Cream Finance.
First to market: I believe Cream Finance has a golden opportunity by being first in adopting Mirror Protocol and emerging as the pioneer in driving the frontier of modern finance before Aave or Compound does so.",14,52.8,2021-04-18

Im not sure how liquid and supported they are on Ethereum.",14,57.8,2021-04-19
['Proposal: Add support for mAssets from Mirror Protocol on CREAM Ethereum'],"Hm yeah I thought about this too. I think the benefit of supporting the straight tokens is that they theoretically will be used for both borrowing / lending. It’s probably interesting for some users to take both sides for price exposure.
For LP tokens, there is clearly a borrowing use case, but why would someone lend this out? A holder of an LP token would be forgoing the MIR yield they could receive by staking, so the opportunity cost is quite high. What do you think?",14,2.8,2021-04-19
['Proposal: Add support for mAssets from Mirror Protocol on CREAM Ethereum'],"I agree with concept.
How would liquidations be affected if UST fails or goes off peg or MIR price collapses? Would CREAM have to take custody of assets on Terra chain in order to completely gain control of liquidated mTokens and keep CREAM solvent?
Mirror uses Band Protocol as price oracles which is known to have outages, delayed updates, and unreliable data sources. I’d prefer using Synthetix assets sTSLA and sXAU which use ChainLink oracles like Cream platform itself. I’d add sBTC and sETH to the proposal which gives us >80% coverage of all their synths and we already have support for their sUSD. sNIKKEI and sKRW would be good to attract asian markets, maybe sDEFI too for another ETF produt.",14,122.8,2021-04-19
['Proposal: Add support for mAssets from Mirror Protocol on CREAM Ethereum'],"1/ Our stablecoins have been around for ~2.5 years (KRT) without breaking peg, so our tech has a long  history of stability
2/ MIR price doesn’t affect liquidations. If a minter utilizes UST for collateral and the price drops in half a day later, the amount of collateral in the position also halves
3/ if User A buys a minted mAsset from a minter, User A does not have to worry about liquidation/solvency issues. When a minter gets liquidated, ANOTHER user is burning his mAsset to in order to claim the collateral from the minter’s position (this is equivalent to the Maker liquidations). Thus CREAM is never in a position where it will need to take custody of these assets. The mAssets (regardless of chain) is always over-collateralized by UST",9,6.8,2021-05-04

Summary
Increase collateral factor of SFI to 45%
For

Increase collateral factor of SFI to 45%

Against

Do nothing (i.e. SFI remains with a collateral factor of 0%)


Motivation
It is important to raise collateral factors of those assets with 0%. 45% is a reasonable collateral factor for a governance token like SFI to begin. As a benchmark, in another CDO ecosystem (e.g. Unit Protocol), SFI began with an initial collateral ratio of 50%.
By enabling SFI as collateral, it provides a great incentive for SFI holders to supply in C.R.E.A.M. Finance, leading to higher TVL for the protocol.
SFI is already trading on multiple centralized exchanges (Poloniex, Gate.io, Indodax). As Saffron continues to build across chains, (e.g. exists on C.R.E.A.M Fantom, BSC, HECO), the exposure and number of holders has increased significantly (>12,000 wallets), diversifying distribution of SFI while mitigating downside price risk. Moreover, the team has locked a significant portion of their tokens for >1 year, further mitigating risk on a rug pull.",8,186.6,2021-04-27

['Increase Collateral Factor of BOND (BarnBridge) to 20%'],"Summary
BOND, the governance token of the BarnBridge risk tokenization protocol, has been eligible for depositing into, and available for borrowing from, Cream since the turn of the year. Since then, the project has successfully established its DAO and launched its SMART Yield application. SMART Yield currently has $80M in TVL, putting it in the top three projects within the DeFi Pulse “Derivatives” category.
This proposal seeks to raise its collateral factor from 0% to 20%. The updated collateral factor would reflect the significant progress the protocol has made since the initial onboarding of the BOND token, and stands to further strengthen ties between our two communities. Currently, no other platform supports collateralized borrowing against BOND.
For

Increase the collateral factor of BOND to 20%

Against

Maintain its current collateral factor of 0%

Motivation
This change is being proposed to reflect the progress the BarnBridge protocol has made since the initial onboarding of the BOND token. In that same vein, the proposed 20% collateral factor reflects that there is still much to be done: onboarding new originator markets beside cUSDC and cDAI, launching SMART Alpha, and achieving greater uptake of our senior SMART Yield tranches, primarily. We have positive outlooks on all three fronts, but recognize that the collateral factor can be raised via future vote as subsequent progress is made.
Further increasing ties between the Cream and BarnBridge communities could also help launch an integration with our SMART Yield application. SMART Yield allows for users to mint either fixed or levered variable rate products based off of underlying debt pools (e.g. Cream USDC would be one), and the BarnBridge DAO has the power to incentivize supported pools should the community vote accordingly.
Background
At the core of the BarnBridge thesis is the market need for diverse yield products. Two particular attributes we are focusing on are the ability to take fixed rate positions, and higher variable risk exposures from a single asset pool. We are taking an approach that’s tried and true in traditional financial markets called risk tranching.
Tranching risk allows investors to take targeted positions and exposure on yield producing assets. These financial assets are generally known as collateralized debt obligations, the most popular of which are mortgage backed securities.
Tranching is the process of subdivided a pool of assets into risk categories with different return profiles. Typically the more conservative and lower risk / lower return pools are called senior tranches and the more aggressive higher risk/ higher return pools are called junior tranches.

The end goal is to create derivatives that give liquidity providers a more diverse set of tradable products that meet their evolving needs. This should create more liquidity in the market for debt products and attract new capital into the DeFi space.

Furthermore, Since Cream is the only lending platform that MCDEX is intending to cooperate with at the moment, there will be a large number of MCB holders wanting to lend MCB on Cream to earn yield. This will bring considerable TVL growth for Cream.

Background
MCDEX V3 is a decentralized exchange that allows anyone to create a perpetual market permissionlessly. Now MCDEX V3 testnet has already launched, V3 mainnet will launch on L2 rollup(Arbitrum) and BSC soon.
Mai Protocol V3 designed by MCDEX is an AMM-based decentralized perpetual swap protocol. Perpetual swap is one of the most popular derivatives that has no expiration date, supports margin trading, and has its price soft pegged to index price.
MCB Tokenomics
According to the approved Proposal 19, the new Tokenomics states:
The total supply of MCB is 10,000,000;
MCDEX DAO is responsible for the specific usage of the newly issued MCB;
The speed of issuance will be under following restrictions:
It is plausible to issue 1 MCB for 1 USD captured by the MCDEX DAO vault
At least 0.2 MCB can be issued by one Ethereum block (approximately 1300MCB/day)
For every new issuance, 75% is for community incentive, and 25% belongs to the developers.

Specification
Information about MCB
Market cap: $57,168,855
Max Supply: 10,000,000
Total Supply: 2,134,738.96
Circulating Supply: 2,134,738

Summary:
Add $MET to the CREAM Finance Ethereum lending market as a supported collateral asset.
Contract: 0xa3d58c4e56fedcae3a7c43a725aee9a71f0ece4e

For

Add MET as collateral to CREAM Finance lending app.


Against

No Change Required.


Background
Launched in 2018, Metronome is known as the world’s first autonomous cryptocurrency. Metronome’s autonomous monetary policy has translated to over $50 million in permanently locked liquidity in its proprietary AMM (which predates Uniswap significantly).
The token offers additional nuanced features like cross-chain support (chain hops), masspay, and subscriptions. Metronome is designed as a new “smart currency” DeFi primitive.

Motivation
Due to the nature of its monetary policy and significant value permanently locked as liquidity, Metronome is a safe collateral token. The floor price of MET (meaning, if every single token holder sold 100% of their MET) is about $1.40 (current price = $3.68). (Calculations made using the CORE floor formula.)
It is impossible for MET to be liquidated at low collateral ratios. But beyond that, this price floor is an extreme, and more broadly reflects that MET is a highly liquid, quasi-stablecoin that makes sense as a better collateral. Token holders of MET are interested in its future as a DeFi currency and are enthusiastic about utilizing it across third-party DeFi platforms.

Background
Founded in 2017, SpaceChain is a community-based space platform that combines space and blockchain technologies to build the world’s first open-source blockchain-based satellite network, allowing users to develop and run decentralized applications in space.
The SpaceChain operating system will be available to anyone, anywhere in the world, all while remaining secure and immutable through proven blockchain cryptography. In doing so, SpaceChain’s vision is to remove barriers and allow a global community to access and collaborate in space.
Spacechain has launched multiple satellites to Low Earth Orbit (LEO), and produced multi-signature Bitcoin (BTC) transactions on the International Space Station (ISS).
Spacechain just released its Callisto development board with fully custom CPUs on FPGA.
Multiple satellite launches are also on the roadmap for 2021.

Motivation
Spacechain’s SPC token community needs borrowing and lending for a healthy token market.  Additionally, a listing on CREAM will enable yield generation from Vesper, where the Spacechain community is hoping for a Vesper + CREAM pool for SPC tokens.

Background
Vesper is dedicated to making DeFi easy-to-use, combining the benefits of a professional approach with the inherent advantages of DeFi. Vesper routes user deposits of major crypto-assets — currently ETH, WBTC, USDC, LINK, and Vesper’s own VSP token — across various DeFi protocols to generate yield. Over time, the project seeks to expand the number of strategies and platforms integrated as well as supported deposit assets — thus this proposal.
The market responded well to the Vesper launch, trusting Vesper with more than $1 billion in Total Value Locked within the first six weeks. (As of this writing, that number is over $1.5 billion.)
VSP is the native currency to the Vesper ecosystem. VVSP is the governance vault that votes on Vesper proposals and shares revenue in the form of VSP buybacks (similar to xSushi and stAAVE).

Motivation
A “yes” vote to Vesper’s proposal enables the following:

Introduces CREAM as a source of yield to the ever-growing Vesper ecosystem.
Establishes additional synergy between Vesper and CREAM to push more assets through the proposal process and create more strategies that route through CREAM.
Increases net deposits across both ecosystems, and more acutely, significant uptick in volume on both lending and borrowing.

['Proposal: Add Nerve as a collateral asset on BSC'],"SUMMARY
We propose to list Nerve for lending and borrowing

For: List NRV as a collateral asset on C.R.E.A.M. BSC


Against: Do nothing

Background
Nerve is an automated market maker (AMM) specifically designed for trading stablecoins and pegged assets on the Binance Smart Chain. Nerve’s first pool is launched with a basket of a dollar-pegged stablecoins consisting of BUSD, USDT & USDC. Nerve recently launched an integrated Anyswap bridge that is decentralized, more efficient, and without transfer limits.
There is a community push from Nerve users to be able to borrow more tokens to increase their ability to provide liquidity.
Abstract
Following its launch on Binance Smart Chain two months ago, Nerve has recently integrated several different mechanisms that allow its users to provide liquidity in stable pools, earn more nerve in LP pools, and earn competitive APY’s from staking the NRV token. The ensuing exponential growth has incentivized users to reinvest their profits, as well as push for lending mechanisms that allow them to increase their investment in the project.
Benefits to CREAM
As the fastest growing DeFi Automated market maker, combined with industry leading low rates of slippage and the added benefits of low gas costs on the Binance Smart Chain, Nerve is positioned well to exponentially capture substantial TVL as the project gains more traction. Combined with a quickly growing user base (Nerve was born 3/1/2021), Nerve is a smooth way to onboard a zealous community that will contribute to the larger CREAM ecosystem in the form of fees and synergies.

['Proposal: Add BIFI as collateral asset on BSC'],"Summary
We propose to add BIFI to Cream for lending and borrowing. BIFI is the governance token of beefy.finance, a cross-chain yield optimizer with over $340M in TVL.
Action Item
For

Add BIFI as collateral asset

Against

Do nothing

Motivation
Beefy Finance was the first yield optimizer on Binance Smart Chain, launching in September 2020 during the platform’s infancy. It has since expanded to HECO and AVAX, quickly accruing $5M in deposits on AVAX alone. Beefy currently has 180+ vaults and will continue to expand to new platforms.
BIFI Token
BIFI serves as a governance and revenue sharing token. A percentage of vault profits are shared with token stakers. The token supply is fixed and all distribution has been completed.
Benefits for Cream
Beefy Finance is one of the most popular yield optimizers on BSC and is considered one of the DeFi “blue chips” on the platform. BIFI’s presence on Cream would provide additional TVL to Cream and an opportunity to earn additional fees as BIFI holders would come to Cream to collateralize their assets.

Q2: What is crToken?

It’s the proof of your supplied asset on C.R.E.A.M. lending. You need to hold it in your wallet for withdrawing supplied assets. (ex: Supply CREAM, get crCREAM as IOU token)


Q3: What is  Net APY ?

截圖 2021-05-28 00.44.231392×470 36.2 KB


That is the sum of your supply APY and borrow APY. It can also be used to check the APY status of your current supplying and borrowing.

Q4: When the interest of supply/borrow accumulate?

Per Block(~15secs) on Ethereum.


Q5: What’s the difference between the Supply APY and Distribution APY on supply modal?

Supply APY is the current interest APY of the asset when you supply, the interest accumulates in the units of the asset. Distribution APY represents the additional reward APY for suppliers.

Q6: What’s the difference between the Borrow APY and Distribution APY on borrow modal?

Borrow APY  shows the interest APY that you have to pay when you’re borrowing, the interest accumulates in the units of the asset. Distribution APY represents the additional reward APY for borrowers.
Reminder: As the asset approaches at high utilization(80%+), borrowers will pay higher interest rates. Please check our document for the interest rate model details.

Myself and Max propose that the C.R.E.A.M. Treasury fund Community Mining, a program that distributes monthly rewards in order to incentivize community contributions to the protocol.
The C.R.E.A.M. team had previously experimented with the Creamery, a Trello board where they posted tasks that needed completing that the community could contribute to. However, this was never a big focus. We can leverage this same board - and make it public - and thereby make it easy for community members can view open tasks and start contributing to them.

['Proposal: Add $SFI as a collateral asset on CREAM Ethereum'],"SUMMARY
Saffron is a chain-agnostic, risk-adjustment protocol in DeFi. Saffron enables yield farmers to mitigate staking risks while simultaneously benefiting from the composability, transparency, and capital efficiency of smart contracts. $SFI is already a supported asset on C.R.E.A.M.'s Fantom chain.
$SFI is Saffron’s native governance token on Ethereum
For: List SFI as a collateral asset on C.R.E.A.M. Ethereum
Against: Do nothing
MOTIVATION
Abstract
Following its launch on Ethereum several months ago, Saffron has recently integrated with Binance Smart Chain and has plans to continue to develop cross-chain to be a critical risk-mitigation tool as part of the entire DeFi ecosystem.
Benefits to CREAM
As the first major DeFi money market protocol to integrate $SFI, CREAM would be well positioned to capture additional TVL as greater adoption of risk-adjusted protocols evolve
Potential for further synergies down the line. Risk-adjusted strategies could be built atop the Saffron protocol
Milestones


First risk-based tranche product deployed in DeFi across multiple chains (ETH, BSC, FTM)


Current TVL: $60M+

['List Yearn Finance v2 yVault tokens as collateral assets'],"Authors
@qosmonot, @dudesahn, @lehnberg
Summary
This is a proposal to list Yearn Finance’s yvYFI, yvDAI, yvUSDC, yvUSDT, yvWETH, yvWBTC, yvBOOST, yvCurve-IronBank, yvCurve-sETH, and yvCurve-stETH v2 yVault tokens as collateral assets. Starts with 0% collateral factor (C1).

Background
Yearn Finance is an aggregator service for decentralized finance (DeFi) investors, using automation to allow them to maximize profits from yield farming.
Yearn is currently the largest yield protocol (in TVL ranking - source: Defi Llama) and the 13th largest DeFi protocol overall (in TVL ranking - source: Defi Llama).

Motivation
In continuation of the previously announced merger between C.R.E.A.M. and Yearn and the milestones that were outlined, we are proposing the addition of the improved v2 yVault tokens as collateral on C.R.E.A.M.
This would allow users to earn interest on their assets via Yearn’s vaults, but still access the borrowing potential of these assets as collateral on C.R.E.A.M. Looking forward, the supplying of yTokens on C.R.E.A.M upon deposit of funds in a vault could be integrated natively on the yearn.finance UI.
Users:
Yearn Finance is:
over 30k YFI token holders
over 100k Twitter subscribers
over 15k Telegram members
over 10k Discord members
waiting to further deploy their combined $1.5 billion locked in Yearn products.
Update:
yUSD and yWETH v1 yVault tokens are already supported assets as collateral on C.R.E.A.M. At the time, these were some of the largest vaults on Yearn. However, we are in the process of replacing all v1 vaults with v2 versions for both improved security and profitability.
On Yearn, the yWETH vault (v1 WETH yVault) has been replaced by yvWETH (v2 WETH yVault) and a migration to the new version is ongoing, with $71 million in our v2 WETH vault compared to only $16 million in our v1 WETH vault. Thus, it makes sense for C.R.E.A.M. to undertake a similar migration toward v2 yvWETH as well.
Liquidity:
Although deposits in Yearn’s vaults earn considerable interest income, there are still relatively few ways to further collateralize these yield-bearing assets. This proposal would allow the Yearn community to borrow other assets against they yVault tokens, while expanding the C.R.E.A.M. TVL and driving borrowing demand.
Total Value Locked in Yearn Vaults = over $1.2 billion split between 40 different vaults (as of April 2021, source: yearn.vision)
Total Value Locked in proposed tokens to be listed = around $750 million (as of April 2021, source: yearn.vision)
Current vaults:
1. yvYFI (v2 YFI yVault)
This vault holds YFI, and utilizes several different strategies to earn yield.
Current TVL = $161 million (as of April 2021)
2. yvDAI (v2 DAI yVault)
This vault holds DAI, and utilizes several different strategies to earn yield.
Current TVL = $121 million (as of April 2021)
3. yvCurve-sETH (v2 Curve sETH Pool yvault)
This vault holds tokens from Curve’s sETH (Synthetix ETH) Pool, and locks in the gauge to earn CRV emissions.
Current TVL = $122 million (as of April 2021)
4. yvCurve-stETH (v2 Curve stETH Pool yVault)
This vault holds tokens from Curve’s stETH (Lido staked ETH) Pool, and locks in the gauge to earn CRV emissions.
Current TVL = $145 million (as of April 2021)
5. yvUSDC (v2 USDC yVault)
This vault holds USDC, and utilizes several different strategies to earn yield.
Current TVL = $74 million (as of April 2021)
6. yvWETH (v2 WETH yVault)
This vault holds WETH, and utilizes several different strategies to earn yield.
Current TVL = $71 million (as of April 2021)
7. yvCurve-IronBank (v2 Iron Bank Curve yVault)
This vault holds tokens from Curve’s Iron Bank Pool, and locks in the gauge to earn CRV emissions.
Current TVL = $62 million (as of April 2021)
Future additions:
8. yvBOOST
This vault holds Yearn’s yveCRV, and compounds harvested 3Crv rewards weekly for more yveCRV.
9. yvWBTC
This vault holds WBTC, and utilizes several different strategies to earn yield.
10. yvUSDT
This vault holds USDT, and utilizes several different strategies to earn yield.
Risk:
As a result of the value accrual nature of the Yearn yVault tokens, the collateral provided grows in value with time. This means the liquidation ratio / health factor grows over time, independently of the token volatility.
Yearn’s v2 vaults have been live for several months now, and have implemented various security improvements, including improved vault/strategy shutdown procedures and removal of public earn functions.

Benefits
C.R.E.A.M. benefits:

Allowing users to deposit the yield-generating version of assets (yVault tokens) rather than the base assets makes the total yield of deposits more attractive (ie. depositing USDT on C.R.E.A.M. or a competitior vs. depositing yield-generating yvUSDT on C.R.E.A.M.).
Yearn currently has a Total Value Locked (TVL) of $1.2 billion across all vaults. Listing the yVault tokens will provide a significant TVL increase locked into C.R.E.A.M. v1, as Yearn has the potential to 7x the C.R.E.A.M. v1’s current TVL of $240 million. This will translate in a significant increase in fees collected by C.R.E.A.M., as users seek to borrow against these assets.

Yearn benefits:

Allowing Yearn yVaults to be used as collateral would give an extra incentive for users to deposit funds on Yearn, increase Total Value Locked (TVL) and fees, and dramatically increase capital efficiency & composability.


Notes


Collateral Factor will start at 0% (C1) as per C.R.E.A.M.'s token listing requirements. A subsequent proposal to raise the Collateral Factor will be drafted following the tokens approval and listing.


Before listing on C.R.E.A.M., Yearn’s yvYFI, yvDAI, yvUSDC, and yvWETH will be migrated to an updated v2 version. yvUSDT, yvWBTC, and yvBOOST are upcoming vaults that are in testing and will be released in the coming weeks. yvCurve-IronBank, yvCurve-sETH, and yvCurve-stETH are existing v2 vaults that are ready to be added to C.R.E.A.M. as-is, and thus would be the first batch to go live.

['Proposal: Increase Collateral Factor of FTM to 45%'],"Summary
This proposal would increase the collateral factor of FTM (Fantom Token) to 45% on CREAM Ethereum.
Motivation
With the recent launch of CREAM on Fantom, and the increased cooperation and integration of the greater Yearn ecosystem on the Fantom Network, FTM was recently added to CREAM Ethereum in this vote. Following the addition of FTM, the next step is to increase its collateral factor to allow holders to borrow against it.
Background
Fantom is an EVM-based blockchain that enables high transaction throughput for low costs, and is currently being integrated by several components of the Yearn ecosystem to help enable cross-chain activity. FTM’s token address can be found here . For more about Fantom, see their website here .
Currently, the largest market that allows users to borrow against FTM is Unit Protocol (unit.xyz), but they have hit their debt limit for minting USDP against FTM. Thus, CREAM can capitalize on demand to borrow against FTM and bring holders of FTM to CREAM, driving revenues for lenders and the CREAM protocol.
I propose setting the collateral factor to 45% for FTM; this aligns well with most other alts on CREAM (source).

['Proposal: Add $DEFI5 as a collateral asset on CREAM'],"SUMMARY
Dear CREAM community, this proposal outlines the case for listing DEFI5 as collateral on CREAM. DEFI5 is a passively managed DeFi index product from indexed.finance, a decentralized protocol for passive portfolio management on Ethereum.
For: List DEFI5 as collateral
Against: Do nothing
BACKGROUND
DEFI5 was created to gives crypto users exposure to the top 5 DeFi projects by simply holding the index token, in addition, DEFI5 token holders earn around 25% APY via swap fees from AMM pools. Since launch DEFI5 has grown to around $20m in TVL.
Key facts:

DEFI5 is a passively managed index of the leading DeFI projects: Uniswap (UNI), Aave (AAVE), Compound (COMP), Synthetix Network Token (SNX) and Curve Dao Token (CRV)
DEFI5 is the top-performing index in DeFi since its inception at the end of December with over 400% growth.
Meta-governance for DEFI5 is enabled for COMP and UNI. This allows indexed.finance (NDX) governance token holders to vote on-chain with the tokens in the Index.

The indexed.finance team has built a strong community of 4,000 discord members and 9,500 Twitter followers. The team aims to push the DEFI5 index as a simple product for new users to Ethereum to gain exposure to the DeFi sector.
MOTIVATION & BENEFITS
DEFI5 is not listed as collateral on any platforms at the time of writing. However, it is regarded as a leading product with the second-highest TVL of any index on Ethereum. Even though the market cap is around $18m, the underlying tokens are prime collateral as they are considered DeFi blue-chips.
Benefits for CREAM:

Increased TVL for Cream: Listing DEFI5 token as the primary place would bring a flow of TVL in the form of DeFi backed collateral to borrow against it (current market cap of DEFI5 is $20m, however, there is significant growth potential as index products become mainstream).
Increased brand-awareness: indexed will fund a marketing campaign to drive awareness to CREAM and DEFI5 products.
Access to NDX token holders: 4,000 holders and the wider Indexed.finance community of 10,000+ people.

TOKEN

['Increase the Collateral Fator of Frax to 60%'],"Summary
To increase the collateral factor of FRAX to 60%.
For

Increase the collateral factor of FRAX to 60%

Against

Do nothing, remain at 0%.

Motivation
FRAX is a stablecoin that has maintained a tight band around $1.00 since launch.  To increase TVL on Cream and the utility of FRAX, the collateral factor of FRAX needs to be increased on Cream.  Over time, I expect that FRAX will be treated similarly to fully collateralized stablecoins for collateral purposes.  In the near term however, I believe that 60% is a reasonable starting point.  For reference, each FRAX token is currently collateralized by $0.88 of USDC and interest bearing equivalents.  This provides a significant margin of safety for Cream; in the event that the fractional algorithmic model suffers a crisis, there is more than enough collateral to fully cover Cream liabilities (88% collateral vs 60% CF on Cream).  Increasing the CF should allow Cream to become an early hub of FRAX lending and borrowing.
Frax is also working on new products that incorporate Cream directly.  Getting FRAX and FXS borrowing and lending on Cream is a first step towards realizing innovative products that could drive significant value to Cream.  If you would like to see this happen, please engage with my proposal to add FXS to Cream here.
Background
More information about Frax can be found at https://frax.finance/ and https://docs.frax.finance/.  The original proposal to list FRAX on Cream also has a lot of information, though FRAX has grown significantly since then.
FRAX had approximately $12.5m of volume in the past 24 hours on Uniswap.

['Proposal: Add TrueFi LP Token as a Collateral Asset'],"Hi, my name is Ryan and I work at TrustToken, Inc.
We are the original creators of the TUSD stablecoin and the recently launched TrueFi protocol.
Summary
I am proposing to add the TrueFi LP token as collateral on CREAM. TrueFi is a protocol for on-chain uncollateralized borrowing/lending. It bridges some DeFi and CeFi elements to make this all possible. When a user deposits TUSD into TrueFi, they receive a TrueFi LP token which represents their proportional holdings in the pool.
For: Adding the TrueFi LP token as collateral to CREAM w/ 0% CF
Against: Do nothing
Background
TrueFi is a protocol for on-chain uncollateralized lending. It bridges some DeFi and CeFi elements to make this all possible. When a user deposits TUSD into TrueFi, they receive a TrueFi LP token which represents their proportional holdings in the pool.
You can read more about what goes into reviewing each loan here. Over time, we will implement additional data points bringing off-chain data on-chain.
Within the TrueFi ecosystem, there are two tokens associated with the protocol.

TRU (0x4c19596f5aaff459fa38b0f7ed92f11ae6543784) - The governance and staking token
TrueFi LP Token (0xa1e72267084192Db7387c8CC1328fadE470e4149) - Lenders’ representation of their proportion of assets in the TrueFi lending pool.

As an example, if you were to deposit 100 TUSD right now and the price of TrueFi LP token is $1.011 you would receive 98.911968348 TFI-LP tokens (100/1.011).
The pool tokens represent a claim on:

TUSD (for now, the only asset that can be lent),
yCRV (where TUSD that isn’t lent out to a borrower sits so that its always earning interest)
CRV (earned because we keep funds in Curve)
A % of each of the active loans tokens

You can see an example image below.
1600×645 82.2 KB
When a user deposits TUSD into the pool, they receive TFI-LP tokens.
At the moment, there is not much that users can do with their TFI-LP tokens so many of them wind up swapping it for TUSD on Uniswap if they want to exit.
We’d like to change that by allowing for CREAM to be the first place they can use their tokens as a form of collateral.
Motivation
Something particularly interesting would be if CREAM also added support for TUSD (I can make another post for this).
Then, for example, a user could…
→ Deposit 100 TUSD into TrueFi, receive 99 TrueFi LP Tokens
→ Deposit 99 TrueFi LP Tokens on CREAM, receive 59 TUSD
→ Deposit 59 TUSD into TrueFi, receive 58 TrueFi LP tokens
→ Deposit 58 TrueFi LP tokens on Cream, receive 35 TUSD
Etc., etc.
A possibly better example is:
→ Users get TFI-LP tokens (which, as a reminder are interest-bearing)
→ Deposit in CREAM
→ Borrow stablecoin/Defi coins and go farm “riskier” XXX% yield elsewhere
That way, their stablecoin farming % + TFI-LP % will likely be greater than the borrowing rate.
Getting TFI-LP listed on CREAM is step one, how it becomes used will depend on market conditions and rates on CREAM + whatever farming opportunities there are
Specification
While TrueFi is, first and foremost, an uncollateralized lending protocol, the TrueFi LP token also acts as an interest-earning dollar-pegged coin. It’s certainly not a stablecoin in the way TUSD is, but it does track to roughly $1(+interest earned).
The total # of pool tokens in circulation is 29,591,442. You can view this one app dot truefi dot io / pool",13,277.6,2021-01-07

['Increase Collateral Factor of IOTX to 45%'],"Summary
To increase the collateral factor of (BSC peg) IOTX to 45%.
For

Increase collateral factor of (BSC peg) IOTX to 45%

Against

""Do nothing, remain at current 0%

Motivation
To increase the usage of IOTX as collateral for Cream Finance and help to increase and attract new users and capital, especially on BSC. Currently, the collateral factor is set to 0% and IoTeX users are unable to borrow against the collateral.
IOTX has a daily trading vol of 10m USD on Binance and BSC and has a great community of 50K users, which will generate organic lend/borrow requirements for CREAM.
Additional Info
Starting out as an open-source project in 2017, IoTeX (iotex.io) has built a decentralized platform whose aim is to empower the open economics for machines — an open ecosystem where people and machines can interact with guaranteed trust, free will, and under properly designed economic incentives.
With a global team of over 40 research scientists and engineers behind it, IoTeX has built their EVM-compatible blockchain from scratch using the innovative Roll-DPoS consensus and launched in 2019 April, which has been running by 100+ delegates worldwide and has processed more than 10 million transactions already. On top of the IoTeX blockchain, the team has built the essential blocks of infrastructures to connect with Ethereum, BSC, and Heco blockchains such as ioPay wallet and ioTube bridge which serve ten thousands of users. IoTeX helps EVM-based DApps scale without concerning expensive gas fees!
In addition, middlewares such as Decentralized Identity, Confidential Computing, and Secure Hardware are built on top of IoTeX blockchain to enable self-sovereign devices such as Ucam and real-world oracle such as Pebble. The former has been deployed to 3000+ households (http://iott.network/) and still grows rapidly, while the latter has been launched to 300+ developers initially and enables innovative Dapps that connect the physical world with the crypto world such as real-world NFTs, weather derivatives, and machine learning-as-mining.",2,20.4,2021-03-23
['Supply disabled message'],"I’m new to CREAM and just tried to supply a token but got a strange response from the site. I was going to supply FTT, so I purchased some on an exchange, transferred to my wallet, made sure I had enough ETH in the wallet, then connected to CREAM. The lending page said “In order to supply FTT you need to enable it first” so I clicked on the ‘ENABLE’ button and at the next step I inputted the amount. After that it gave me a message “supply disabled”. Any idea what that message means? Does it mean the site disabled the supply? If so why wouldn’t it say that on the lending page so that users would not go through all the steps to buy the token, move to wallet etc etc. Or is there some setting that I control to enable / disable the supply?

"['Increase Collateral Factor of AUTOv2 to 60% (4th most supplied, and 2nd most borrowed assets in Cream BSC)']","Summary
Increase the AUTOv2 collateral factor from currently 0% to 60% at Cream BSC
For

"" Increase the collateral factor to 60% for AUTOv2

Against

“Collateral factor stay at 0%”

Motivation
This proposal intend to open for discussion for 24hours to collect feedback, interests for all Cream users before casting to vote. However, since BSC governance in Cream didn’t seem existed yet, it will be great if team can give guideline how i could proceed this.
AUTOv2 is a native token from Autofarm which is a cross-chain yield aggregator now available in BSC,HECO and aiming for Polkadot and others in 2021. TVL in Autofarm currently around $1.3B which ranks no.3 in BSC and has been no4 most supplied, no.3 borrowed assets in Cream BSC for some time. By enabling AUTO collateral factor to 60%, will attract more BSC users to Cream hence helps Cream to secure its leading position in BSC lending/borrowing market.",6,6.2,2021-03-21
['List $Rune as Collateral Asset'],"Summary
We propose to add $RUNE to CREAM for lending and borrowing.
THORChain
THORChain is a cross-chain Uniswap and decentralized liquidity network based on Tendermint& Cosmos-SDK and utilizing Threshold Signature Schemes (TSS) to create a marketplace of liquidity for digital assets to be traded in a trustless, permissionless & non-custodial manner.
THORChain has launched a single chain chaosnet that currently supports the Bitcoin blockchain and soon ERC-20 assets. At the same time, THORChain communities are working on Cosmos (ATOM) 、Polkadot 、Zilliqa、Monero/Haven、BitcoinCash and Solana.
$RUNE
$RUNE is the governance token of THORChain. The function of $RUNE in the Thorchain network is as the settlement asset that secures the network through the token economy. $RUNE is also used as an incentive to reward liquidity providers and subsidize gas. $RUNE was one of the best performing exchange tokens in 2020, and gained more than 3000% last year.
THORChain recently released ERC-20 $RUNE in addition to the BEP version of the token. Since launching the ERC-20 version of $RUNE in mid-January, liquidity on Sushiswap has already passed US$15M.
Benefits for CREAM
BEPSwap is the cross-chain DEX powered by THORCHAIN built on the Binance Chain - THORChain plans to replace this with their cross-chain dex ASGARD - this will help the CREAM ecosystem bridge ERC20 and BEP assets.
THORChain is included in CREAM partner’s Sushiswap’s 2021 roadmap as the ideal partner for Sushiswap’s crosschain DEX integration. There are also numerous token pairs in the Yearn ecosystem that could benefit from crosschain options.
With so many incredible developments from $RUNE and the huge potential market of cross-chain DEXes, we predict that $RUNE will be the next blue chip DeFi asset. This will bring more TVL to CREAM over time.
Action Item
For: Add $RUNE to CREAM.
Against: Do nothing.

['Add yETH2 (V2 Yearn ETH Vault) as a collateral asset'],"Summary
A proposal to add the return asset for Yearn.finance’s ETH Vault V2, yETH2.
For

If “For” passes, yETH2 gets added

Against

If “Do nothing” or “Against”, yETH2 does not get added

Motivation
yETH is already a supported asset on CREAM, which is the return asset of the V1 Yearn ETH Vault. However, in recent weeks Yearn has launched a V2 ETH Vault. The return asset for this vault should be supported on CREAM, as well. $44 million is currently locked in V2, while only $18 million is locked in V1 (and draining quickly in migration to V2). CREAM should keep up with this migration and add yETH2.
Background
Yearn is a strategy-optimized protocol that pools users’ funds together in vaults to use as liquidity across various DeFi products in order to gain the highest level of secure yields possible. The have 1 vault per asset (such as a yDAI Vault, yETH Vault, yUSDC Vault, etc). Recently, they’ve begun upgrading their vault architecture and as a result, have created new yAssets (such as yDAI2, yETH2, yUSDC2, etc).
Specification
The yETH2 token address is: 0xa9fe4601811213c340e850ea305481aff02f5b28
Note: the asset is technically yVaulted Wrapped ETH V2, which is symbolized on-chain as yvWETH (see Etherscan). However, the V1 asset ticker symbol is currently displayed on CREAM as yETH.

Add KEEP, the Keep Network work token, as a Borrowing Asset on CREAM.
For

Add KEEP as a Borrowing Asset on CREAM with collateral factor 0% and reserve factor 40%.

Against

Do nothing.

Motivation

strong demand for borrowing and lending from KEEP tokenholder community

5,000+ KEEP token holders and circulating market cap of $130,000,000
active Discord community with thousands of members and hundreds of participation in the Play for Keeps community building competition
Keep Network node operators can borrow KEEP to perform more work on Keep Network and potentially earn higher returns
holders that are accumulating KEEP to run a node can lend on CREAM in the meantime
holders that are accumulating KEEP to run a node can borrow on CREAM to meet the minimum node requirements
there are active farming opportunities for KEEP and KEEP liquidity that may motivate KEEP borrowing on CREAM


successful first Keep Network application: TBTC, trust minimized BTC on Ethereum

1,000+ holders of TBTC and many more farmers, already approved as collateral on CREAM
400 users minting and redeeming almost 2,000 TBTC with Keep Network
200 operators staking millions of KEEP and bonding 105,000 ETH to secure Keep Network applications


safe addition for CREAM if collateral factor is later increased

['Create CREAM Listing Team'],"Summary
Create an elected group that will manage the asset listing process to improve research and security of incoming assets, reduce governance overhead, and expedite implementation.  This will onboard more collateral to increase TVL and fees.
Motivation
This proposal comes from the confusion and friction I’ve heard and personally experienced had seen in listing new assets. It’s hard for teams trying to list their asset on Cream to know:


What are the requirements for getting listed? (liquidity, age, security audits, etc.)


What is the whole process is to get listed and how long until my asset is implemented? (also seems most don’t know that they need to do a 2nd vote to be able to take out loans on their asset)


Who do I go to for advice on getting listed and engaging the community?


How do I get a vote up if I don’t have sufficient CREAM? ($300k is steep requirement even for active CREAM members like me)


CREAM started out as the “fast and scrappy” but listings have started to fall behind compared to speed that tokens are being released on the market. With the addition of LP tokens to the platform the risk of some of these assets is bigger but it also provides a larger market to capture so we need a faster and more reliable process for adding new and high quality assets to the platform This is even more true with the financialization of the NFT market where we could list NFTX LPs, Charged Particles NFTs with embedded ERC20s, or other primitives being released.
The listing team will serve a couple of important functions for the CREAM community:


Single point of contact for teams to get information and advice on listing assets


Trusted group of advisors for CREAM community to vet tokens and make sure they don’t pose a risk to the platform


Streamlined and expedited process for listing assets


Potentially collaborate with other protocols like Aave and Maker on our collateral research efforts


Governance Details
The listing team should be like the Spartan council - an elected group with complete autonomy to list assets based on the team’s research. Each team member would receive an NFT that gives them 1 vote. The team must make a unanimous decision on all parameters - interest rate model, collateral factor, and reserve factor - in order to be listed.
Given that almost all proposals need to go through the CREAM team anyway due to the extremely high costs of acquiring the 1,500 tokens required to create a Snapshot vote this doesn’t actually change the listing process all that much, just make it more explicit and expedited.
One key change to governance by adding the listing team would be to revert this proposal that requires all new tokens start at 0% collateral. While a good safety measure it adds lots of friction and governance overhead to the listing process and the precaution won’t be necessary if we have a dedicated team to ensuring quality tokens and appropriate collateral before listing.
Note: This is just a listing team, anyone can create a proposal to delist or change asset parameters at anytime
Note: This listing team only applies to the ETH platform not the BSC platform which will continue as is.

['Create CREAM Listing Team'],"This seems like an interesting proposal Kiba, I think that the 5 person team makes sense to have these diversified folks. I’d like to ask if you desire the community members to hold or not hold a certain amount of assets, what they need to/don’t need to disclose they hold; there may be a need to refrain from having individuals voting on assets they hold, so that there may be a need for more people to help make it a fair process.
Additionally, I’m thinking that more of a framework should be established as the “CREAM Guidelines For Listing”, if we can get some dune analytics dashboard or some onchain metrics that measures the liquidity, volatility, user adoption, and product TVL, etc. (perhaps need more advanced metrics like user retention day over day, etc.) in order to comprise of say 50-75% of the points system, and then a yay/nay/abstain vote for the members to create a pseudo-multisig, pseudo automated onchain data framework.
Then we can actually set the default collat ratio based on the scoring of the points, frameshifted to scale. For example, if a project gets 60% vote power across multisig + onchain stats, it starts off at 0% collateral.  Then map the 60%-100% vote power to 0-80% LTV, so every 1% vote power above 60% helps move up starting LTV by 2%?

['Create CREAM Listing Team'],"Hey Calvin! Thanks for the input. Definitely down for token disclosure by listing team. Ideally it wont matter since shitcoins would never get unanimous decision and you should be incentivized to list your tokens’ competitors so that you have a market to short them easily. Favorable treatment of meh tokens might eventually create a risk if it happens continuously with no interference from normal governance but that’s why this is just a listing team and not a full management team.
A framework is something I expected to come out of the group instead of a requirement beforehand since currently there isn’t any logic. Like how was SWAG listed? And its cream market is 3x bigger than it’s marketcap?!?
My hope with this team is that we will branch out the cream market and the tokens we list are too diverse to fit into a single points system. How do you compare MASK/ETH LP tokens to LIDO? Totally different markets with no common metrics.
Having collateral ratio scaled according to dex liquidity is a good start to a framework. So long as there is a market to liquidate positions, we don’t list tokens that can go to 0 or have weird tokenomics like aglostables that mess up the comptroller, and there is viable market for us to earn fees,  it shouldnt really matter what their users are or if they earn revenue etc.",19,143.8,2021-03-03

Sub-teams within the DAO is a great idea!  Think of it like a consulting group overseeing a project.  You’d have a Project Manager (broad skills), a couple strong analysts, and some technical folks.  The key is having measurable KPIs that these Teams have to achieve.  Without KPIs, things go off the tracks… FAST.
That being said, a listing Team is definitely 1 of many Teams that could help govern and move CREAM forward.  I like this idea.  Again, what are the KPIs?  How are listings tracked?  This is all part of the Team’s responsibilities.  The Team should also be rewarded if they exceed expectations.

Following 2, what is the decision power of this team?

I’m not going to finalize everything right now, but these question are important to the community. I have to bring them up before we empower this listing team.

IMO, the ideal workflow is that the team provides opinion with for / against / neutral to the token listing during its discussion session. That means we should include the team’s opinion in the governance officially. Voting of listing new token cannot kick off (in X days) without the team’s opinion, and the team are obliged to provide opinion in X days.
However, it also leads to some issues like centralization and cherrypicking. For example, what if there are 20 tokens proposal in a week? I don’t think the team can take care of the workload, but who to decide what tokens to be reviewed or not? And how to incentivize the team?

['Create CREAM Listing Team'],"I’m just realizing I never linked to the Spartan Council spec which provides some clarity
https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-93. I’ll add it to my original post as well. A tl;dr of its features:

team elected by token holders monthly via quadratic voting in current CREAM snapshot space
team votes via new snapshot space where each team member has one vote represented by am NFT
NFT contract is controlled by CREAM multisig to revoke from voted out members and give to new members
team members can be voted out at any time by token holders by changing their vote on snapshot
CREAM DAO has veto power over listing team decisions

Answers to your questions:


What is the new listing procedure? - Listing procedure is mostly the same. Community makes proposals for new assets to be add to CREAM platform. Votes happen on a new Snapshot instance where Listing Team has 1 vote per NFT holder instead of all CREAM token holders voting on each proposal. In addition I would also like to override your past proposal that new assets start at 0% collateral and let collateral % be included in listing proposals to streamline process. Reserve % can also be part of listing proposal, if not submitted in a proposal then listing team will add it before voting to add the asset.

When and where does the team start to participate? - Listing team would be commenting on proposals in the forum and discussing with the community member / defi team that is looking to have their asset listed. Listing team will probably be making their own proposals as well and let community comment in the forum before they go to a vote. I would suggest listing team also does a write up of why they listed the asset and process for choosing asset parameters like reserve factor after every vote, even if it fails.

What is the decision power of this team? - The listing team has power to list new assets on CREAM platform without going through standard governance votes. Standard governance still has power to veto listing team decisions. Once an asset is listed, listing team has no control over and standard governance takes over where CREAM community has power to modify listings like increasing collateral, delisting it for whatever reason, etc.

Imo this is favorable to listing team only giving advice/research for a few reasons:

1,500 CREAM is way too high a barrier of entry for legitimate members to make their own proposal. This means whether an asset goes to a vote (therefore whether it gets listed or not) is up to CREAM team’s discretion at the moment anyway.
If we implement quadratic voting for electing listing team members it allows smaller CREAM holders to have more impact on protocol governance without compromising sybil resistance and spamming by lowering token threshold for creating proposals
Cherry picking is not directly preventable but members can be voted out at anytime so that should disincentive the behaviour initially, and prevent it from happening a second time.
Most people wanting their assets listed dont care about the CREAM platform so dont provide analysis on risks or benefits the token adds to the platform before it goes to vote.




 eason:

I believe that this team would be very helpful to the whole protocol, but only when it has profession, transparency and decentralized / anti-manipulation at the same time.


Completely agree and my goal with this is to achieve exactly that. Since creating votes can really only be done by CREAM team or massive whales, implementing a listing team is a massive improvement in all of these categories to the current structure.",12,12.4,2021-03-13

['Create CREAM Listing Team'],"Reply to your answer:


I agree that starting at 0% collateral factor should be removed. DAO is not efficient in decision making, and 0% collateral factor make the listing and market even worse.
However, I don’t agree with reserve factor being decided per voting. IMO we should put token into a few categories and set reserve factor for each of them once and for all (thru DAO of course). Only when it comes to a pretty special case in crypto industry, for example USDT and its risk, should we decide the reserve factor thru the voting by case. Otherwise we should follow some norms by default like Major token: 20%, Governance token 40%.


Seconded, and then we should make “motivation” part necessary in the proposal template.


Not sure when we, as protocol team, should get started on preparing listing in this workstream. Can you elaborate more or raise some example?

['Create CREAM Listing Team'],"
Makes sense about the reserve. I don’t feel strongly about that but collateral factor is def a blocker
I think motivation is already part of proposal template just no one uses it lol
I was assuming people from protocol team would be on the listing team but I guess you guys might not want to be on it or wont get elected at all for some reason. In that case the listing team would reach out to protocol team after some initial research once we are confident in an asset and want to make sure it is allowed in the protocol before going more indepth (e.g. making sure something like rebase tokens dont get too far down the pipeline). We can work towards. a formal multi-step, multi-team approach like MakerDAO prioritization. I know conceptually what needs to be done to get an asset listed but if the protocol team could detail step by step the infrastructure and txs that need to be setup to list an asset i can make a more concrete plan about communication between the two teams.

['Add bDollar as a BSC borrowing asset'],"Summary
bDollar should be added to Cream on Binance Smart Chain to satisfy a lot of short interest. This will in return provide a lot of reserves.
Proposal
We have seen that coins with a strong short interest tend to be very popular as borrowing assets. Furthermore (and I refer to CAKE), these interests can go in the 100s of % of APY. It is for this reason I think it would be a great idea to list bDollar on binance. As an algorithmic stablecoin, there will always be a whole lot of short interest and thus a whole lot of reserve money to be made.
bDollar is becoming extremely popular on BSC: The marketcap is about 51 million at the time of writing and growing, price is $1.17 (currently still above peg).  The address is 0x190b589cf9fb8ddeabbfeae36a813ffb2a702454.
Algorithmic stablecoins have always been pretty risky, so obviously this should have collateral factor 0.
The protocol itself currently provides a lot of incentives so the highest interest rate model should be used.

Overview
NFTX is a platform for issuing ERC-20 tokens that are backed by NFTs. These tokens are called funds, and allow for investors to have exposure to NFT markets without needing to trade/hold individual NFTs. Using the decentralized exchange, It is possible for users to create and trade funds based on any NFT such as CryptoPunks, Hashmashs, CryptoKitties, and Avastars. An overview of listing/upcoming NFT index funds can be found on the documentation site: https://docs.nftx.org/nft-index-funds/index-funds
With increasing interest in the NFT market, the NFTX governance token can bring immediate and long term value to the Cream platform.

NFTX Mechanics
NFTX has 2 types of funds on its platform: D1 and D2.
D1 funds are ERC-20 tokens represented 1:1 by an underlying NFT. When an NFT is added to a particular pool e.g., for basic CryptoPunk, an ERC-20 token for that pool is given in exchange. This ERC-20 token can be traded, added to a D2 fund, or redeemed for a random NFT in the underlying pool of basic CryptoPunk.
D2 funds are ERC-20 tokens represented by multiple D1 funds. For example, the PUNK D2 fund is backed by multiple CryptoPunk pools such as basic Cryptopunk, female CryptoPunks, etc. These tokens are the ones most commonly purchased by investors looking for broader exposure to NFT markets.

['Proposal: Add $GNO as collateral asset on CREAM ethereum'],"Summary
List Gnosis token ($GNO) as a collateral asset for supplying and borrowing on Cream Finance Ethereum
For

Add $GNO as collateral

Against

Do nothing

Abstract
$GNO is the governance token for the GnosisDAO. Gnosis has been around for some time and has been focused on 3 lines of products -> Prediction Markets, DEXs, and Wallets.

Gnosis Safe is the most used Multisig wallet on Ethereum, with ~$17 Billion USD worth of assets being held in Gnosis Safe contracts
Conditional Tokens Framework, a Prediction Market framework used by Omen and Polymarket
DEX’s such as GPv1 (Mesa), and the upcoming Gnosis Auction protocol

Gnosis recently transitioned to a DAO, and delegated 150K ETH and 8 Million GNO (vested over 8 years).
$GNO token is the governance token that allows voting in order to direct the DAO.
Motivation
The main motivation is to make $GNO more accessible to people through lending and overall liquidity.
$GNO is already quite a liquid token in DEXs and CEXs, as it can be seen in the following pools at time of writing:

Uniswap (0x3e8468f66d30fc99f745481d4b383f89861702c6) -> ~$16M USD


Balancer 80/20 (0xe42237f32708bd5c04d69cc77e1e36c8f911a016) -> ~$33M USD


Balancer 50/50 (0xdbe29107464d469c64a02afe631aba2e6fabedce) -> ~$10M USD


Sushiswap (0x41328fdba556c8c969418ccccb077b7b8d932aa5)-> ~$1.5M USD

Additionally, $GNO is listed on Kraken, and has daily volumes of over $300k USD across /ETH, /USD, /XBT, and /EUR pairs.
An important thing to note is that since the transition to the DAO, GNO has proved to be very correlated with ETH which is useful to provide stability and resilience to the pool of assets on Cream.
We strongly believe that enabling users to lend and borrow $GNO will help both Cream and GnosisDAO achieve things such as:

['List bBADGER as Collateral Asset'],"Summary
We propose to add $bBadger to CREAM for lending and borrowing.
BadgerDAO went live on December 3, 2020. Badger is a governance token for the DAO while bBADGER is the token that represents one’s position in the Badger Sett. bBADGER is indicative of a user’s partial ownership of the assets within the vault.
Currently, the TVL across all Setts is ~ $1,000,000,000 (https://app.badger.finance/)
Should this proposal be accepted, CREAM would be the first lending protocol to accept bBADGER tokens.
What Is Badger?
Badger is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) focused on building the products and infrastructure necessary to accelerate Bitcoin as collateral across other blockchains. Specifically, it is an ecosystem DAO where projects and people from across DeFi can come together to collaborate and build the products DeFi needs. Shared ownership in the DAO incentivizes builders to have aligned objectives while decentralized governance ensures that those incentives remain fair to all parties and that the projects pursued are determined by the community. Badger is, first and foremost, a community-led initiative that prioritizes collaboration over competition and operates on fairness, transparency, and high collective engagement.
Badger’s first of two products are Sett, an automated DeFi aggregator focused on tokenized BTC assets, and DIGG, a non-custodial synthetic Bitcoin on Ethereum. Sett was launched on December 3, 2020, Digg successfully launched on January 22, 2021
How do the Sett vaults work?

User goes to app.badger.finance and deposits $BADGER
User receives $bBADGER that represents their share of $BADGER staked in the Sett
$bBADGER is yield bearing and the rewards earned will be auto compounded for the user soon, outlined in BIP 24 (https://forum.badger.finance/t/bip-24-badger-boost-multiplier-replacement/1914)
User’s can at anytime unstake and claim their share of the $BADGER in the Sett

Benefits for CREAM
Access to Badger’s User Base: Badger brings along with it a vibrant community of 6,000 holders and 6,000+ community members, known as Badgers, on Discord.
Increased TVL for Cream: This proposal will allow the CREAM TVL to expand and will allow the Badger community to borrow other Assets against their $bBADGER tokens.
At the time of writing, the Badger Sett has 3,467,679 $BADGER tokens in the vault earning 126% APY. These tokens represent ~ $86,484,000 in TVL.
The price for $bBADGER is determined by price of badger * PricePerFullShare() of the bBADGER contract.
Action Item
For: Add $bBADGER to CREAM.
Against: Do nothing.

Active
SUMMARY
I think this proposal is pretty straight forward considering the ywETH is already accepted.
MOTIVATION
Considering the yvWETH (v2) already has 18M+ deposited about half of the 26M in yWETH there are more than enough people looking for places to put their vault shares to use.
I don’t think this proposal required much explanation beyond this and is probably quite logical.
For
Add yvWETH as a collateral asset on CREAM Ethereum.
Against
Do not add yvWETH as a collateral asset on CREAM Ethereum.

['Proposal: Add KEEP as collateral Asset'],"Proposal by @ramaruro and @Estebank
Summary
We propose to add KEEP to CREAM for lending and borrowing.
KEEP is the work token of the Keep Network, used for staking and work allocation in the network. The first main project of the Keep Network is TBTC, a decentralized version of Bitcoin in Ethereum. TBTC has already been voted as a collateral in CREAM, and will be added in the coming weeks to CREAM, see vote here
Details about KEEP
KEEP is required to run Nodes that mint, redeem and secure TBTC. It will also be used for future applications of the Keep Network, in addition to the live project TBTC.
KEEP is called a work token, because it is required for staking in the network nodes; a higher amount staked increases the chances of the Node to be selected for work, as well as the amount of rewards assigned to that Node for work executed.
Example of Use Case for KEEP Token as Collateral
A user (Lender) has KEEP tokens (earned through the Liquidity Mining Program of the KEEP Network, or bought on the market) but does not want to operate a Node in the KEEP Network.
She could lend those KEEP tokens in CREAM for an Operator to borrow; this would increase the Operator’s chances of being selected and the amount of Rewards earned for being assigned work. The operator could secure this loan with their TBTC (recently approved in CREAM).
A Win-Win-Win situation:

Owner of KEEP earns interest by lending it
Node Operator earns bigger rewards in the Keep Network staking the borrowed KEEP
CREAM earns the spread on the Borrow/Lend interests

Current Liquidity and Availability

This proposal would add FTM (Fantom Token) as a collateral asset on CREAM Ethereum.

['Proposal: List PERP as a collateral asset'],"Summary
We propose to list PERP for lending and borrowing.
For: List PERP
Against: Do nothing
Background
In case you haven’t heard of the Perpetual Protocol (perp.fi), here is a quick recap:
Perpetual Protocol is a decentralized perpetual contract protocol for every asset. With the help of our virtual AMMs (vAMMs), traders can trade perpetual contracts with up to 16x leverage without the need to wait for a counterparty.
PERP is the native token of the Perpetual Protocol, and there are two utilities for it:

Staking:
PERP holder can stake their tokens on the protocol. In return, they’ll be rewarded with the staking rewards (in PERP) and a cut on the transaction fees (in USDC).
Governance:
Stakers can use their staked PERP to vote on 1) the next new market to be included on the protocol and 2) the important parameters of the protocol.

Milestones

The cumulative trading volume reaches 100M USDC in less than 3 weeks after launch.
The peak single-day trading volume is over 80M USDC.
The number of unique traders per day is over 100.
image1082×568 28.2 KB


Benefits to CREAM
Due to PERP’s recent price surge, some LPs have exited the Balancer LP Rewards Program provided by the team for fear of the impermanent loss. As such, by accepting PERP as the collateral on the protocol, CREAM could capture additional TVL from these PERP holders whose assets currently sit idle.
Specification
List PERP at a Collateral Factor of 0%
Audits
The protocol has been audited by Peck Shield and Consensys. The audit report from the former can be found here.
And we also have an ongoing bug bounty program with up to 10% TVL inside the Clearing House contract as the bounty rewards.",14,197.8,2021-02-09

['Proposal: Add stETH as collateral asset'],"Summary
List Lido’s stETH as a collateral asset for supplying and borrowing on Cream Finance.
For

Add stETH as collateral asset.

Against

Do not add stETH as collateral asset.

Motivation
Cream will be the first lending protocol that successfully integrates stETH, attracting a large target audience that would like to borrow stETH or lend out their stETH on the Cream platform. In addition, idle stETH on the Cream platform will also be earning yield while kept in the reserves.
Background
Lido is the leading liquid staking protocol on Ethereum.
Lido, built on Ethereum 2.0’s beacon chain, allows users to earn staking rewards on the beacon chain without locking Ether or maintaining staking infrastructure.
Lido lets users deposit ETH and receive stETH in return. stETH represents the user’s staked ETH balance on the beacon chain along with staking rewards accrued or penalties inflicted on Lido validators. Rewards are reflected through a daily stETH balance rebase. When transactions are enabled on the beacon chain, stETH can be redeemed for the newly unstaked ETH along with the accumulated rewards earned through the balance rebases.
stETH tokens represent a tokenized staking deposit. stETH tokens can be held, traded, or sold. The total supply of stETH is based on the total amount of staked ETH plus total staking rewards earned minus a 10% commission fee as well as any slashing penalties applied to validators if they were to occur.

Market Cap: 183,000 ETH / $283,000,000
Max Supply: -

History and growth of stETH issuance can be tracked here: duneanalytics.com/vsh/lido-finance-extended
stETH is currently traded on the following platforms:

Curve Finance

Liquidity: $360,934,350.66
Volume: $851,429.73


Uniswap

Liquidity: $13,736,429
Volume: $264,503


SushiSwap

Liquidity: $25,932,216
Volume: $855,234



*Numbers up to date as of March 2nd 2021.
Specifications
a. Risks

Slashing

Lido has been working for 2.5 months without bugs or a single slashing event. Still, slashing remains a risk. There is a slashing cover by Unslashed Finance.

Oracle

stETH is not traded on CEXes and thus the oracle has to use Curve pool price + ETH price feed to determine current price, which might be difficult to do safely.
b. Audits
Lido contracts have been audited by Sigma Prime and Quantstamp.
Conclusion
Currently, users that would like to earn yield on their stETH but would rather not take any risks of supplying it to a liquidity pool (eg. impermanent loss) can lend out their stETH to the platform to earn Eth2 rate simultaneously with lending rates. The addition of stETH into Cream Finance will attract a larger audience to the platform, as well as to allow for more composable and efficient DeFi use cases. Aggregators (eg. Yearn Finance) can use stETH in their yield farming strategies, and borrowers and lenders can utilize stETH to their benefit.",15,838.0,2021-03-03

['Proposal: List FXS as a Collateral Asset'],"Summary :
FXS is the governance token of the Frax stablecoin protocol.  FXS currently has a $50 million market capitalization on approximately $10 million of daily volume.  The FXS token currently governs over $240 million of value contained within the Frax protocol.
FXS was recently listed on Binance but is not currently listed as collateral on any decentralized money market protocols.  This presents C.R.E.A.M. with an opportunity to become an early hub of FXS related lending and borrowing.
Abstract :
FRAX is a fractionally algorithmic stablecoin with a dynamic collateral ratio that adjusts based on the market demand for FRAX. Currently, each FRAX is collateralized by approximately $0.88 USDC and $0.12 of the Frax governance token, FXS. When the price of FRAX is at or above $1.00, the protocol gradually lowers the collateralization ratio of USDC to FXS. When the price of FRAX is below $1.00, the protocol gradually increases the ratio. FRAX can always be minted or redeemed by the protocol for $1.00 of assets, which counterbalances significant price deviations from the $1.00 target. Frax emphasizes a highly autonomous, algorithmic approach with no active management of the price stability function.  FXS is integral to the functioning of the Frax system, both as a volatility sink and stabilizing token within the protocol.  FXS holders participate in the governance of the protocol.
Liquidity:
FXS has approximately $31m of liquidity across Uniswap and Sushiswap trading pairs.  FXS is also listed on Binance, which can account for up to 50% of total daily volume.
24 Hour Trading volume: $10 million
Motivation :
Frax is a rapidly growing project beginning the process of integration with existing DeFi protocols like C.R.E.A.M. By integrating FXS, C.R.E.A.M. would add an attractive collateral asset that would likely expand platform TVL. It would allow users of C.R.E.A.M. to leverage existing assets against FXS and vice versa.  Frax community members have expressed a desire to leverage against their FXS holdings to farm more FXS.  The Frax community will also benefit from C.R.E.A.M. integration by providing a strong lending option for FXS.  FXS integration will also further product interactions between Frax, C.R.E.A.M. and the broader Yearn ecosystem.  This will enable innovative new products that should drive fees and TVL to C.R.E.A.M.

['Proposal: Add UST as a Collateral Asset'],"Hello, I’m a member of the Terra team. This is my second time posting about this, as UST has seen a significant increase in demand since my last post.
Token Overivew:

TerraUSD (UST) is an algorithmic, seigniorage-based stablecoin issued by Terraform Labs
(TFL). UST is one of the fastest growing algorithmic stablecoins to-date. Its market
capitalization has grown to over $250 million since its inception on October 1.


TFL currently uses Shuttle (https://github.com/terra-project/shuttle#terra--ethereum) to bring
Terra assets, including UST, to Ethereum. At the time of this writing, the supply of erc-20 UST is
roughly $70 million. UST currently has a daily trading volume of ~$100 million.


UST is the primary stablecoin used on Mirror Protocol (https://mirror.finance/). UST pools also exist on a number of Ethereum-side applications, including Curve, Uniswap, Sushiwap, Balancer, etc.
The Uniswap UST-USDT pool currently has ~$25M of liquidity. https://info.uniswap.org/pair/0xc50ef7861153c51d383d9a7d48e6c9467fb90c38

['List LON (Tokenlon) as a collateral asset'],"Summary
Proposal to list LON as an asset available for supplying and borrowing
For: List LON
Against: Do nothing

Tokenlon
Tokenlon is a decentralized exchange and payment protocol. It was incubated by the imToken in 2017 and currently runs as a separated product and team. imToken is one of the largest decentralized digital assets wallets in the world trusted by millions of users.
As one of the first teams building decentralized exchanges in the space, Tokenlon launched its first decentralized exchange in March 2018 and has gone through five major iterations.
Tokenlon Highlights

Tokenlon is one of the top decentralized exchanges by both volume and number of users. 150k users have traded more than $8B volume on Tokenlon so far.
Tokenlon is one of the most profitable DeFi applications in the space, ranked as one of the top decentralized applications by revenue by stats tracked by TokenTerminal.
Tokenlon is in a unique position to bring imToken’s ten million users to its conversion funnel.

LON token
The LON token is the utility token of Tokenlon protocol. Token holders can participate in the community governance and enjoy privileges like receiving trading fees discounts while using Tokenlon protocol.
Benefit for Cream
Tokenlon has a very large community (150k+ existing traders and 10m+ users of imToken wallet) and a good amount of token holders (47k addresses holding LON token). However, as LON token was issued just recently, it is currently not available on any lending platform.
Being the first lending platform to add LON as a collateral asset will introduce Cream to a large number of users and become the first place for them to lend LON. LON currently has a market cap of $137m (circulation supply), if 20% of it goes to Cream for lending, Cream’s Total Value Locked (TVL) can increase by roughly 15% at the time of writing.
In short, adding LON on Cream can introduce Cream to millions of potential users and increase Cream’s TVL by a very good amount.

['Add $OCEAN (Ocean Protocol) as a collateral asset to CREAM Market'],"Summary
Hello everyone, I am very excited to propose OCEAN listing on CREAM finance platform. Ocean Protocol is a decentralised data exchange protocol which enables data providers to monetise their private data using compute-to-data technology. Ocean Protocol’s datatokens act as on-ramp and off-ramp for data assets into DeFi. Ocean Market integrates Balancer AMMs for swaps, and LPing directly on data assets (Ocean datatokens)
I see this collaboration as a really good fit for both OCEAN and CREAM communities. Here’s why -
About $OCEAN
OCEAN, the native token of the Ocean Protocol is already a well traded token with average daily trading volume in excess of $115 mn and tradable on many major CEX like Binance, Poloniex, Gateio, Bittrex, and Kucoin. But more importantly, it has very sizable liquidity and available on Defi platforms like Uniswap, SushiSwap, Balancer, Bancor, Dharma and Kyber. We will be collaborating with more partners in Defi space.
With our recent Ocean v3 launch, we have moved firmly into the DeFi space and a natural progression is to create an OCEAN lending market. We can’t think of a better place to do this than with the CREAM community. Being able to borrow and lend OCEAN would enable holders to collateralize their OCEAN.
Ocean Protocol Foundation is ready commit to providing initial liquidity of about 625k OCEAN tokens (approx. $500,000 USD), along with contributions from our strong community of OCEAN holders. This initial lending by Ocean Protocol Foundation will also provide legitimacy to the lending pool and attract other community members to lend/borrow OCEAN.
Some Stats about Ocean Protocol

$320M marketcap (source - coingecko)
Top 100 project in CMC and Coingecko by Market Cap
42k+ twitter followers and 11k+ telegram community
OCEAN token has $115 million daily traded volume (source - coingecko)
TVL on Ocean Market is approx $882,935 USD equivalent in OCEAN tokens and $486MM USD equivalent in OCEAN + datatokens combined

Launching $OceanO stablecoin backed by $OCEAN token in 3-4 weeks (via OpenDAO and UMA protocol)
In Bancor, OCEAN/BNT pool has about $13MM USD in liquidity and is one of the top 10 pools
In Uniswap, OCEAN/ETH pool has about $3.6MM USD in liquidity and more than $1.5 MM USD in daily volume
Ocean Token page in coingecko has > 25k likes
As per etherscan, there are > 25k OCEAN token holders

The Future: Collateralizing Data Assets with CREAM <> Ocean Protocol
Besides developing an OCEAN lending market, there are other more interesting initiatives that we’re excited to develop with the CREAM community. As of today, Ocean Protocol has over $850k TVL in our datatoken pools.
Our datatokens are ERC20 tokens and each of them are underlying assets of their own data market. We see a vivid future where each of these datatokens can have their own lending market on CREAM. This will be groundbreaking for both Ocean and CREAM and help CREAM become the first lending protocol that collateralized real world data with efficiency and scale.
Other collaborations that might be interesting for the Cream community is to source curated data from Ocean Protocol marketplaces to be able optimise the lending rates and possibly provide under-collateralized loans. CREAM community may also choose to monetise the data Cream platform generates to fund the platform and to incentivize users using the platform.
There are multiple collaborations that both Ocean and Cream communities can work out. I hope the CREAM community sees OCEAN as a good fit and potential long term collaboration partner.

['List RAI (and possibly ETH/RAI LP) as Collateral Asset'],"Summary
We propose to add RAI—our stable-ish coin—to Cream for lending & borrowing.
RAI is an asset backed only by ETH, governance-minimized, and programmed to maintain its own price stability without needing to peg to an external price reference like the USD. We believe these qualities make RAI ideal initially as an alternative to pegged-coins for use in DeFi as collateral and as a stable reserve asset, especially for programs where resilience is critical.
We just announced our launch ~2 hours ago, and there is already $7.5M in liquidity!

Cream is the leading lending platform for the long-tail of DeFi assets, often being first to list innovativenew assets. In the case of RAI, maintaining system stability is greatly assisted by having a leverage facility to balance ETH/RAI longs. By depositing RAI as collateral in Cream, borrowing ETH, and selling for more RAI, traders would be able to go long on RAI/ETH and help correct short-term RAI price dips. As such, Cream could be instrumental to helping RAI establish itself as a new independent stable reserve asset for DeFi, and the Cream community could earn fees from our activity along the way  .",16,388.2,2021-02-17

['Proposal: Add bDIGG as a Collateral Asset'],"Summary
We propose to add $bDIGG to Cream as a collateral asset. We think being able to lend and borrow bDIGG on Cream would open up several exciting opportunities for both Cream and Badger.
About Badger
Badger is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) focused on building the products and infrastructure necessary to accelerate Bitcoin as collateral across other blockchains. Specifically, it is an ecosystem DAO where projects and people from across DeFi can come together to collaborate and build the products DeFi needs. Shared ownership in the DAO incentivizes builders to have aligned objectives while decentralized governance ensures that those incentives remain fair to all parties and that the projects pursued are determined by the community. Badger is, first and foremost, a community-led initiative that prioritizes collaboration over competition and operates on fairness, transparency, and high collective engagement.
Badger’s first two products are Sett, an automated DeFi aggregator focused on tokenized BTC assets, and Digg, a non-custodial synthetic Bitcoin on Ethereum. Sett was launched on December 3, 2020, and Digg was launched on January 22nd, 2021.
About DIGG
An elastic supply token pegged to the price of Bitcoin and governed by the Badger DAO. bDIGG is the token that represents one’s position in the DIGG Sett on app.badger.finance and is indicative of a user’s partial ownership of the assets within the vault. The current yield on bDIGG stands around [154.28]% APY with over $[58m] locked in the Sett Vaults, making this an ideal productive asset as collateral.
How does it work?
Elastic Supply - Across all wallets, the total supply is adjusted based on demand to reflect the pegged price of bitcoin.
Daily Rebase - If the price is above the USD value of BTC that day the rebase is positive and balances increase, if the price is below, the rebase is negative and balances decrease.
Non Dilutive - This means DIGG is non-dilutive. Like Bitcoin, if you own 1% of the overall network you will always own 1% unless you actively make a transfer.
Continuous - The process repeats every day and is built into the DIGG protocol. Making its rules transparent and equal for everyone.
How do the Sett vaults work?
User goes to app.badger.finance and deposits $DIGG
User receives $bDIGG that represents their share of $DIGG staked in the Sett
$bDIGG is yield bearing and the rewards earned will be auto compounded for the user soon, outlined in BIP 24 (https://forum.badger.finance/t/bip-24-badger-boost-multiplier-replacement/1914 32)
User’s can at anytime unstake and claim their share of the $DIGG in the Sett
Benefits for Cream
Access to DIGG’s User Base: DIGG brings along with it a vibrant community of [3,137] holders (source) and [11,000]+ community members, known as Badgers, on Discord.
Increased TVL for Cream: This proposal will allow the Cream TVL to expand and will allow the Badger community to borrow other Assets against their $bDIGG tokens.
Risk Mitigation
We have been audited by both ZOKYO on December 11, 2020 and HAECHI on January 26, 2021. The DAO has funded a bounty on the Immunefi bug bounty platform for up to $500,000 to mitigate bugs and exploits. Seen here, Badger DAO Launches $500k Bug Bounty Program with Immunefi. A “War Room’’ with some of the industries leading white-hats in the space has been established in advance to prepare for quick maneuvering in case any exploits occur.

['Add renBTC as Collateral Asset on BSC'],"Summary
renBTC is a tokenized representation of BTC on the Binance Smart Chain blockchain. It is implemented as a standard BEP-20 contract, and backed 1:1 by native BTC locked in RenVM. It is redeemable at any time for native BTC. Individuals can acquire renBTC by minting it with native BTC via the RenBridge, or through exchanges.
We propose to list renBTC on Cream-BSC.
For

List renBTC with collateral factor at 0% on Cream-BSC

Against

Do nothing

Motivation

Bitcoin is the most liquid and highest trading-volume crypto assets (aside from USDT). renBTC is the easiest form of wrapped Bitcoin you can get on Binance Smart Chain if you are holding BTC in a regular Bitcoin wallet. You only need to visit RenBridge and send BTC to a gateway to mint renBTC for yourself on your Binance Smart Chain wallet
It is likewise very easy to go from renBTC to regular BTC on your BTC wallet by visiting the same bridge as mentioned above
renBTC on BSC is the same token as renBTC on Ethereum, making it easy for borrowers and lenders of renBTC on the Cream-Ethereum side to switch over to Cream-BSC
These factors can drive a lot of lending and borrowing volume for Cream-BSC

Risks:

As with any new token there are smart contract risks, but given that the contract is the same as on the Ethereum side, it is deemed to be safe
Bitcoin is not a risky asset compared to other crypto assets, but there is an additional risk that comes from RenVM, which is the custody risk. Because RenVM holds the BTC that backs renBTC, a problem with RenVM can cause issues with renBTC. Our highest priority is working on making the RenVM network as safe and decentralized as possible, and we’ll be launching many features over the year to make it more safe and decentralized

Background
The Ren Project launched RenVM, a byzantine fault-tolerant network that is able to securely in a decentralized manner do ECDSA threshold key generation and signing via sMPC, which allows RenVM to manage (ECDSA) private keys of different assets like Bitcoin, Zcash, Filecoin, and mint representations of these assets on smart-contract chains like Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum. Since launch in May this year, RenVM has processed almost $3B in total volume of Bitcoin, Zcash, Bitcoin cash, Filecoin and Dogecoin going to and from Ethereum.
RenVM is a crypto interoperability network that:

enables universal interoperability between blockchains: anyone can use RenVM to send any supported asset to any application on any supported host chain in any quantity.
has robust security*: large bonds, large shard sizes, and continuous shuffling make RenVM extremely difficult to attack, even for irrational adversaries. In the unlikely event of a successful attack, RenVM can restore lost funds through seizing bonds.
is scalable: as more assets are locked into the custody of RenVM, the algorithmic adjustment of fees allows RenVM to automatically scale its capacity to meet demand.
provides an optimal user experience: users can interact with multiple assets, applications, and chains with only one transaction.

*when rolled out in the next mainnet phases, currently the network is centralized to allow time for bootstrapping network security as more nodes in RenVM are coming online and more features are deployed

Motivation
It is important to raise collateral factor of those assets with 0%, and not to mention Alpha Finance is our important partner. After considering its on-chain liquidity, we believe 60% is a reasonable collateral factor for ALPHA.
By enabling ALPHA as collateral, it provides a great incentives for ALPHA holder to supply in C.R.E.A.M. Finance, leading to higher TVL of the protocol. Also, ALPHA has many liquidity pools that’s deep enough for liquidator to mitigate the protocol downside risk.",8,191.6,2021-02-18

Increase collateral factor of OGN to 45% (level C3)
For

Increase Collateral Factor of OGN to 45%

Against

Do nothing, which means stay at 0%

Motivation
It is important to raise the collateral factor for assets currently set at 0%. Doing so increases the usefulness of the Cream platform which attracts new users and capital.
After analyzing the collateral factors of comparable assets on Cream, it looks like 45% is a reasonable starting point for a highly liquid ($64M traded in the last 24 hours) governance token that is already listed on top exchanges like Binance.

Adding DPI/ETH LPs from Uniswap and Sushiswap would immediately open up a $70M market for Cream in reliable and high growth assets with lots of borrow demand to participate in the various DPI/ETH farms. An immediate 60% LTV will attract more lenders to deposit in Cream instead of these farms and is important for listing this asset in my opinion.

['Iron Bank Revenues - buyback and burn/build treasury'],"Hello everyone,
I write to congratulate the CREAM team in implementing the Iron Bank and creating a novel use to secure undercollateralized loans.
The increased utilization of certain coins via CREAM will incentivize organic liquidity on CREAM and create a positive feedback loop of supplying and borrowing on CREAM, resulting in a significant increase of revenue to the protocol.
These revenues from the Iron Bank could  be designated as funds to reward holders and users of CREAM by increasing the value of CREAM. A possibility is to put the funds into two buckets of (a) buyback and burning circulating CREAM tokens and (b) building a treasury to be used for the sole purposes of maintaining the Iron Bank and its business.
Despite the various criticisms of buyback and burn, several protocols and exchanges like Celsius and FTX Exchange successfully practice regular buybacks.
My current proposal is to split Iron Bank revenues 50-50 with respect to the (a) buyback and burn and (b) Iron Bank treasury.
I look forward to discussing!!!",24,79.8,2021-02-02
['Iron Bank Revenues - buyback and burn/build treasury'],"This is great, but I believe there was a previous proposal that shows the CREAM multisig will allocate around $300k to a buy and make strategy with funds reallocated from CreamY Swap and CREAM Swap. I personally prefer buy and make vs. buy and burn because it is more capital efficient - burned tokens are wasted when they might be reallocated to drive future incentives.
The team has also mentioned they are working on a new token model and I hope they take this into consideration.",22,4.4,2021-02-03
['Iron Bank Revenues - buyback and burn/build treasury'],"Hello! I think having a discussion is the proper move. Again, CREAM is accumulating a treasure chest of revenue and the governance can move the treasury in the proper direction.
As long as a proposal incentivizes the usage of CREAM and provides value for the token I will support. If there is an efficient use of the extra revenue, that’s fine by me.
I focus on the token because a higher token price -> increased use. That along with the Iron Bank business is a particularly unique opportunity.
Are you familiar with any community members? I think we can start having real conversations and drive tokenomics towards users and holders of CREAM.",19,3.8,2021-02-03
['Iron Bank Revenues - buyback and burn/build treasury'],"This plan sounds good, but instead of doing a 50-50 split, I think it would be better to do a 40-60 split where 40% goes to token burn and 60% goes to building the treasury up.
A token burn will result in scarcity, which should have an upward effect on price, but in order to have long-term price growth, Cream needs to keep developing the Iron Bank.
The Iron Bank is one of the most innovative things that Cream has done to date. Cream Finance is now the only protocol that is giving the equivalent of a corporate line of credit to successful partners who meet the whitelist criteria. Lending through the Iron Bank will increase the inflows of capital into Cream, so I think that while a token burn is a good idea, it would be more beneficial in the long term to allocate funds to grow the Iron Bank.
The success of the Iron Bank will move the price of Cream tokens. I would even be in favor of a 30-70, but I think 40-60 is a good plan that others would more likely be in favor of.",16,3.2,2021-02-04
['Iron Bank Revenues - buyback and burn/build treasury'],"A topic I am looking forward to hearing more about. Seems really early on in the development of Iron Bank (defi in general) to be be worried about returning excess capital via buyback/burn. I would focus on securing treasury, and reinvesting in new products/partnerships, ways to incentivize best devs etc.
90/10 with most of reinvestment back in treasury for 1st few years, and begin increasing token-friendly activities once there are less attractive opportunities (industry matures)",14,17.8,2021-02-05

Framing this discussion is important. I don’t think this is a question of what to do with excess capital, it is what to do with this new capital. As a user and holder of the CREAM protocol and token, that is a priority for me.

C.R.E.A.M. being a leader in the lending market, could capitalize on an opportunity to list a newly created synth. sTSLA is a novel equity synth that is offered by synthetix through a secure chainlink price feed.
Less than 24hrs after inception, sTSLA is already tradable external to the SNX protocol with reasonable liquidity ($8.2M) in a 80-20 sTSLA/sUSD Balancer pool. There will also be rewards allocated to the above mentioned pool from the synthetixDAO, insuring liquidity is incentivized to remain.

['Proposal: List ALPHA as Collateral Asset'],"For: List ALPHA as collateral
Against: Do nothing
BACKGROUND
Alpha Finance Lab is focused on building an ecosystem of DeFi products that will interoperate to maximize returns while minimizing risks for users. Alpha products focus on capturing unaddressed demand in DeFi in an innovative and user-friendly way.
Key facts:

ALPHA is a governance token for Alpha Finance Labs ecosystem and portfolio of products - token holders can vote on the opened proposals for key product metrics.
First product from the portfolio is Alpha Homora - a protocol that enables leveraged yield farming. It captured $1 billion of TVL within 4 months since it’s launch in October 2020, bringing Alpha Homora to top 10 of DeFi Pulse (at the time of writing #9) .
Upcoming products include AlphaX, a decentralized, non-orderbook perpetual trading platform with tokenized positions and funding rate baked into the price of the asset.

Alpha Finance CEO, Tascha Punyaneramitdee has an extensive worldwide banking background with a vision to reform traditional finance in a decentralized manner. Also former Head of Strategy for Band Protocol. Alpha team commitment is to grow the whole DeFi sector by building innovative products including Alpha Homora v2 that is strategically integrated with CREAM V2 by the first-seen implementation of protocol-to-protocol lending.
MOTIVATION & BENEFITS
ALPHA is not listed as collateral on any platforms so far, yet it’s liquidity pools with ETH tend to be highlighted as trending on many AMM’s. By outstanding achievements, Alpha attracted the attention of the whole DeFi space including the recent announcement of Delphi Digital investing in the project. Other investors include The Spartan Group, Multicoin Capital, DeFiance Capital.
Benefits for CREAM:

Increased TVL for Cream: Listing ALPHA token as the primary place would bring a flow of TVL in form of Alpha tokens as collateral to borrow against it (current market cap according to CoinGecko is $558m)
Increased brand-awareness: Alpha Team is already collaborating with CREAM, borrowing liquidity for it’s leveraged positions in Alpha Homora v2. Listing Alpha as collateral would cause a stream of marketing activities that will bring new users to CREAM - 6000 members of Telegram Group and 33k of twitter followers.
Access to Alpha token holders: 7500 holders + over 20k users participated Binance Launchpad

TOKEN

['Proposal: List ALPHA as Collateral Asset'],Alpha Homora is a user of CREAM’s Iron Bank so my sense is adding Alpha as a new collateral type brings relatively low incremental risk and would help strengthen the collaboration between both protocols. I’m definitely for it.,20,34.0,2021-02-10
['Proposal: List ALPHA as Collateral Asset'],"I think that this would be a good idea in terms of value capture.
Right now, the ALPHA token doesn’t have much utility beyond a speculative asset. In the near future, Alpha Finance Lab will release their tokenomics for ALPHA, but as of right now, there are many ALPHA holders who have either bought ALPHA outright or have earned ALPHA through leveraged yield farming or by providing liquidity to the ibETH/ALPHA pool (when rewards were active for that LP).
Listing ALPHA as a collateral asset will enable ALPHA holders to use their ALPHA as collateral and borrow from Cream, which benefits our platform. When the tokenomics are released in the future, ALPHA could be a draw for users who want to borrow ALPHA for arbitrage, staking rewards, etc. That is a speculative point, but their could be a sizeable market for lending ALPHA sometime later this year.
Cream would strengthen the partnership that we have with Alpha Finance Lab and benefit from shared marketing. Seeing as ALPHA is relevant for BSC borrowers, there is additional value capture from that chain and any inter-blockchain operability that comes along with the Stargate release on Cosmos later this month.
I would be in favor of adding ALPHA as a collateral asset for Cream, but I do want to disclose that I hold ALPHA. Would like to see others share their thoughts, too.",20,59.0,2021-02-10

['Add $INDEX as a collateral asset to CREAM market'],"
Summary
$INDEX is the governance token of the Index Cooperative, a protocol that curates crypto indices targeted at institutions and professionals who are non-crypto natives. The Index Cooperative’s flagship product is the $DPI has over $100 million in AUM which makes it the leading DeFi index.
The Index Coop is led by a strong team of Set Protocol, DeFi Pulse and an active community.
Motivation
Currently, there are not many opportunities for $INDEX holders to utilized the $INDEX token to accrue additional value. The only option for $INDEX holders is to LP on SushiSwap which may not be attractive to most holders. Cream would benefit from accepting $INDEX since it would be the first place to accept $INDEX as collateral and it would attract long-term $INDEX holders. $INDEX hodlers will be more than happy to unlock some of the liquidity of their tokens which would lead to additional revenues for CREAM.
Also, CREAM was the first place to accept $DPI as collateral. Accepting $INDEX would be a great way to continue to develop ties between both projects.
Why HODL $INDEX?
As Lemonade Alpha so eloquently puts it -
“$INDEX as a long-dated call option on Defi: $DPI is only growing as a percentage of the tokens inside it. As $DPI makes ground as a percentage of its components, fees attributable to INDEX multiply.”
Additionally, the CoinSharesCo Gold & Cryptoasset Index (CGI) and Defipulse/Pulse, Inc.'s Flexible Leverage Index (FLI) will be launching shortly and will continue to grow the Index Coop’s AUM.
Specification
$INDEX market cap is $26 Million with 2,500 holders
There is over $2.5 million worth of liquidity for the $INDEX token -

['List ibETH as Collateral Asset'],"Summary
List ibETH  - interest bearing ETH, from Alpha Finance protocol - as collateral asset.
For

List ibETH as collateral asset

Against

Do nothing

Motivation
CREAM and Alpha has already established a strong partnership. Alpha Finance is one of the few protocols whitelisted in Iron Bank and both have major plans for their respective V2 releases.
Background
Alpha Finance is already an important protocol in today’s DeFi scenario. With 600+M TVL in less than 4 months of its first product launch, it found a great underserved niche in the ecosystem. Also, it is about to launch its V2 with further improves to current lead product, Alpha Homora, an leveraged yield farm application.
Furthermore, there are 280608.42 ETH deposited backing ibETH in Alpha Homora. APY provided as ibETH has been steady at 7-8% with spikes to 25-40% in ETH terms.
ibETH risks are related to Black Swan events where liquidators may not liquidate underwater positions in time. Quoting Alpha Homora risk section

3. ETH Lenders share the risk of debts accrued by underwater positions in case liquidators did not liquidate in time
Note: This has not happened before.

And last, there are no major lending protocols that use ibETH as an collateral yet. There is an untapped demand of users who want a nice APY to there ETH, but also want to borrow against it. I believe CREAM could further improve this relationship and acquire Alpha lenders to ist user base.",13,102.6,2021-01-28
['List ibETH as Collateral Asset'],"I’m also worrying about the liquidation risk.
According to CoinMarketCap, there is only one trade pool of it: ibETH/ALPHA in Uniswap. This is not that ideal for liquidator to cash out. Thus, I’m not quite sure about this risk within.
Btw your first link leads to PICKLE’s CoinGecko page.",10,7.0,2021-01-29
['List ibETH as Collateral Asset'],"Yeah, i did post the wrong link, sorry. I’ve used the pickle proposal as a template. Thanks for highlighting it.
I don’t know how exactly does the liquidation mechanism works in CREAM, but a liquidator could seize a ibETH position and then proceed to redeem it for ETH in Alpha Finance.
ibETH is closely pegged to ETH, the additional risk is on Alpha Homora liquidators fail to liquidate the leverage positions and not having enough ETH to back ibETH. I see it relates to a systemic risk. We can picture it as an discounted ETH based on this risk (maybe ibETH = 0.9 ETH or 0.95, idk)",10,2.0,2021-01-29
['List ibETH as Collateral Asset'],I’m not an expert on Alpha Finance but i think @Psittaci.Irati is right that ibETH is always redeemable for ETH for liquidations,8,1.6,2021-02-02
['List ibETH as Collateral Asset'],"ibETH is a great asset for lenders on Alpha Homora, but the one drawback of ibETH from a collateral perspective is that when Alpha Homora’s utilization rate gets closer to 100%, you cannot redeem ibETH tokens for the underlying ETH. Since the underlying ETH is being used for the leveraged yield farming, it cannot be withdrawn from the platform during those times of high utilization.
Alpha Homora V1 often had very high utilization rates, and one question that is brought up during the periods when the utilization rate is higher than 94-95% is: why can’t I withdraw my ETH from the earn pool?
Lenders do earn very high interest rates during times of high utilization (the closer to 100% utilization, the closer the rate approaches 40% interest), but that high interest rate is to attract more liquidity into Alpha Homora’s Earn Pool.
I believe that could cause issues for Cream if a position needs to be liquidated and the utilization rates are high on Alpha Homora V2. Alpha is migrating its liquidity from V1 to V2 right now, and I have ETH in the V1 Earn pool, so I can confirm on Alpha Homora V1 that the utilization rate right now is 91.44%.
I know on Alpha Homora V2 there is high demand for stablecoins, and the ibDAIv2, ibUSDCv2, and ibUSDTv2 are unable to be withdrawn for underlying assets because those assets are all being utilized and there is no underlying liquidity to access at the moment. The same will likely be true with ibETHv2 once the migration from the V1 pool to the V2 pool is complete.
Just my two cents. I think we should wait to evaluate the utilization rate of ETH on Alpha Homora V2 once they migrate and we are able to have a better idea what the average utilization rate for the ibETHv2 pool is.",8,61.6,2021-02-03

['List Origin Protocol (OGN) as a collateral asset'],"Summary
Proposal to list OGN as an asset available for supplying and borrowing
For: List OGN
Against: Do nothing

BACKGROUND
OGN is the governance and ecosystem token for Origin Protocol and Origin Dollar (OUSD). Origin Protocol is a protocol for peer to peer commerce and has released a suite of commerce products including Dshop and the Origin Marketplace. OUSD is a yield-aggregating rebasing stablecoin backed by USDT, USDC, and DAI designed to be a currency that further powers peer-to-peer transactions. It is a stablecoin and serves as a medium of exchange and unit of account while also earning yield for buyers and sellers that use it as a means of transaction. OUSD suffered a hack shortly after launch but has successfully relaunched after multiple completed security audits. The Origin team stands by their products and has committed to compensating affected OUSD users, which is unusual in DeFi.
OGN was previously listed on Harvest as a staking asset via popular vote. OUSD was listed on SushiSwap for LP rewards and SnowSwap for staking rewards.
MOTIVATION
OGN has a very large and established community (over 500k members) as well as a diverse investor base. Investors include Steve Chen (founder, YouTube), Alexis Ohanian (founder, Reddit), Garry Tan (partner, Y Combinator), Justin Blau (DJ 3LAU), Foundation Capital, Pantera Capital, Blockchain.com, and KBW Ventures (headed by Saudi Prince Khaled bin Alwaleed). Adding OGN as a collateral asset on Cream will join the two communities and encourage OGN holders to become Cream users and CREAM holders. The Origin team has committed to publicly marketing and promoting the Cream suite of products.
SPECIFICATION

Standard ERC-20 token.
Metrics available on the OGN Token Dashboard

['Proposal: Add $bBadger to CREAM as a collateral asset'],"Summary
We propose to add $bBadger to CREAM for lending and borrowing.
BadgerDAO went live on December 3, 2020. Badger is a governance token while bBadger is the token that represents one’s position in the Badger Sett on app.badger.finance. bBadger is indicative of a user’s partial ownership of the assets within the vault.
Currently, the TVL across all setts is $554,004,093 (app.badger.finance), primarily in BTC via CRV LP tokens.
Should this proposal be accepted, CREAM would be the first lending protocol to accept bBadger tokens.
What Is Badger?
Badger is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) focused on building the products and infrastructure necessary to accelerate Bitcoin as collateral across other blockchains. Specifically, it is an ecosystem DAO where projects and people from across DeFi can come together to collaborate and build the products DeFi needs. Shared ownership in the DAO incentivizes builders to have aligned objectives while decentralized governance ensures that those incentives remain fair to all parties and that the projects pursued are determined by the community. Badger is, first and foremost, a community-led initiative that prioritizes collaboration over competition and operates on fairness, transparency, and high collective engagement.
Badger’s first two products are Sett, an automated DeFi aggregator focused on tokenized BTC assets, and Digg, a non-custodial synthetic Bitcoin on Ethereum. Sett was launched on December 3, 2020, and Digg is scheduled to launch in the very near future (date TBA).
Benefits for CREAM
Access to Badger’s User Base: Badger brings along with it a vibrant community of 2,350 holders (source) and 5,000+ community members, known as Badgers, on Discord.
Increased TVL for Cream: This proposal will allow the CREAM TVL to expand and will allow the Badger community to borrow other Assets against their $bBadger tokens.
Action Item
For: Add $bBadger to CREAM.
Against: Do nothing.

['List sXAU sXAG and sOIL for lend and borrow'],"Add sXAU sXAG and sOIL to Cream lending
Synthetic Gold, Silver and Oil offered by the Synthetix protocol are reliable highly liquid forms of tokenized off-chain commodities. All Synths from Synthetix are redeemable for their Chainlink price-feed in $sUSD, and are backed by over $1.5Billion in staked SNX. The stability offered by these particular synths makes them great candidates for lending and borrowing and by listing sXAU sXAG and sOIL, CreamDotFinance would be offering its users unique access to a diverse asset class.
For

List sXAU sXAG sOIL for lend and borrow

Against

Do Nothing

Motivation
Synthetic Assets on ethereum are an extremely useful financial instrument for DEFI users, they offer token holders exposure to commodities otherwise unavailable on chain. In most cases the main issue with synthetic assets (or tokens which track the aggregated price of an underlying) is their redemption liquidity.
As of this writing there are $1.7Billion dollars worth of SNX staked in the Synthetix protocol and in theory that could represent the liquidity cap of any synth.
Listing tokenized synthetic Gold on Cream for lend and borrow, would give CreamDotFinance users the ability to borrow sOIL (for example) against a variety of collateral types not offered in any other defi protocol. Synthetic assets are not a novel primitive and neither is lending, but there is an opportunity to leverage the use case of unique assets on a diverse lending platform in a way that is unprecedented in traditional finance and DEFI. The marriage between decentralized synthetic assets and decentralized lending is a perfect fit for the Synthetix and CREAM communities.
Background
sXAU sXAG and sOIL are tokens that are tradable for their corresponding $USD value through the Synthetix protocol. These synths derive their value from an aggregated ChainLink price feed and are redeemable with 0% slippage at any time. $SNX holders stake their tokens in the synthetix staking contract and therefore collateralize a debt pool representing the value of all circulating synths, (currently at $460M USD). All synths can be swapped for $sUSD (which is a stable coin with more than 170M in liquidity across various dexes), alternatively some synths may also be swapped for a selection of non-Synthetix assets through Curve.fi, making them HIGHLY liquid tokens on Ethereum.
Details about the synthetix exchange/kwenta and all the products it offers can be found at: https://blog.synthetix.io/

['Add xSUSHI for Borrow and Lend'],"Summary :
Add xSushi to CREAM for Borrow and Lend
SUSHI
xSUSHI is the governance token of Sushiswap, a community-led DEX with a current TVL of more than US$1.9 billion.
xSushi is one of the two currently supported assets for Sushi governance (ETH/SUSHI SLP is the other). Sushi governance is not currently fully decentralized, but the members of the Ops multisig and Treasury multisig are expected to respect all of the governance votes. Sushi is planning for xSushi to eventually become a fully decentralized DAO most likely leveraging Aragon v2 in 6 to 12 months depending on the progress made by its community.
xSushi is receiving 0.05% of all the Sushiswap swaps and should also benefit from all other future revenues streams from new platforms like Bento, Miso, Gusoku, Deriswap, and more.
The current yield on this asset ranges between 10-40% APY with over US$450 million locked (at today’s $Sushi price) in the Sushibar making xSushi an ideal productive asset for collateral.
Some additional data points can be found here:

https://sushiswapanalytics.com/bar 
https://sushi.zippo.io/sushibar 

Sushiswap’s other token, $SUSHI is already supported on CREAM with a 60% collateral factor.
Given the short existence of SUSHI on the market and the volatility, we think these parameters should be considered (and voted on in a subsequent vote per CREAM new asset procedure that mandates all new assets begin with 0% collateral factor):
Collateral Factor - 40%
Reserve Factor - 20%

['List STASIS EURO (EURS) as Collateral Asset'],"Summary
We propose to list EURS for lending and borrowing.
For: List EURS
Against: Do nothing
Background
EURS is the largest euro-backed digital asset, combining the benefits of the world’s second most traded currency with the transparency, immutability, and efficiency of the distributed ledger technology. Created by stablecoin crypto-enabler platform STASIS, EURS mirrors the euro’s value on the blockchain and is supported by assurance mechanisms provided via an ecosystem of liquidity providers, custodians, exchanges, payment platforms, and others. Each token is backed 1:1 by euros held in the company’s reserve accounts.
EURS stablecoin combines experience, trust, technology, and financial infrastructure to enable business growth, narrowing the gap between the European financial and the digital asset markets. This in-house solution utilizes multi-blockchain interoperability to shortcut financial inefficiencies, often present in old-school financial systems.
STASIS is a trusted legit platform focused on transparency with a solid track record and vast expertise in technological, financial, and legal fields. Since all EURS are backed with fiat euro, there is no risk for investors and everyday users, who can always exchange their digital assets thanks to the Sellback Service.
EURS project has popular global social media accounts and many local communities in different countries combining over 60.000 members as well as a diverse investor base that includes institutions.
EURS stablecoin seeks to challenge the U.S. Dollar’s dominance in global financial markets. By 2021 it has become a popular tool for daily transactions, free of risks and volatility inherent in conventional cryptocurrencies. The potential of stablecoins use cases has been recognized in times of crisis, and the demand for EURS is growing steadily in the DeFi field.
Currency, EURS Pools available in Curve, Uniswap and others. Pool on MakerDAO and more protocol support are coming soon.
Motivation
Broadening the ecosystem:
This proposal will allow the EURS global community to borrow other assets against their EURS and will contribute to the expansion of CREAM TVL. Adding EURS as a collateral asset on CREAM will led to the fusion of the two communities and encourage EURS holders to become CREAM users.
Moreover, it will open a new gateway for European users into the emerging DeFi world.
Since USD-backed stable coins are heavily dominating the market, Europeans/Asians are often forced into undesired dollar exposure with little on-chain hedging options. EURS pool will develop the euro markets on Cream as it will be the first euro-backed stablecoin on the protocol, a safe harbor and refuge for all investors who don’t count their wealth in dollars and need a more robust currency to lean on.
Additional strategies: As CREAM starts to collaborate with the Yearn ecosystem there might arise additional opportunities to use EURS through CREAM in the forthcoming future.

Pause the borrow of CREAM. Prevent CREAM from being borrowed.
For: Borrow Pause for CREAM
Against: Do nothing
Motivation
As the token of the protocol, CREAM is not only essential to the community member, but also plays an important role as our governance token. For the sake of stability of CREAM, we should prevent CREAM from being borrowed.
This is an arguable implementation. However, it’s also practiced among lending protocols.
Aave also prevents AAVE from being borrowed. Despite the reason might be different, but it’s the same concept to stabilize and prevent the token from being manipulated. As protocol team, we consider this is a good implementation to the community and the whole protocol. Thus, we would like to implement via Borrow Pause.

['List MIC as Collateral Asset'],"Summary

Mithril Cash aims to become the de-facto standard for algorithmic stablecoins in DeFi. It is a fork of the Basis Cash protocol, which we believe to be the most robust design in the space. The project has been well received by the market, with over $1.4B in TVL in the first 24 hours after launch.

For: List MIC as a collateral asset
Against: Do nothing
Motivation
Abstract
The Mithril Cash protocol controls money supply similarly to how central banks of the world may guide the value of fiat money through monetary policy. By controlling the quantity of money supply in an economy by minting fresh currency or selling bonds, a target value can be achieved (In this case $1). Instead of a central bank or a currency board, rules are set and executed programmatically via smart contracts so that behavior of the system can be predictable.
Every 24 hours, the TWAP of the MIC price from the MIC-USDT Sushiswap pool is used to determine if the MIC supply needs to be expanded or contracted. The stabilization threshold is currently set to 1.01 MIC/USDT.
If TWAP > 1.01, expansionary policy is applied and new MIC is minted using the formula circulatingSupply *(oraclePrice-1)
If TWAP < 1.01, contractionary policy is applied. Mithril Bonds are made available for purchase at an algorithmically set price. With a Mithril Cash oracle price of P USDT, bonds are sold off at a price of P MIC (effective price being P^2 USDT), promising bond holders a premium when redeemed. Purchased bonds can be converted to Mithril Cash at a 1:1 rate, insofar as the preconditions are met and the Treasury is not empty.
Benefits to CREAM
• As the first major DeFi protocol to integrate MIC, CREAM would be well positioned to capture additional TVL as our circulating supply grows
• Potential for further synergies down the line. Leveraged strategies could be built atop the MITH protocol
Milestones
• Sushiswap trading volume on Day 1: $96M
• Currently ranked 5 and 6 on Sushiswap
• TVL: $1.4B within 24 hours of launch.
• Decentralized: 3x the number of holders as comparables
• Partnerships: QCP Capital

CRETH2 value should be on par/above ETH.  Once cream incentive rewards ended, ratio has been unfavorable to CRETH2.The difference in collateral factor is a factor for lenders to move back to ETH.
Increasing collateral factor at same level of ETH, should reduce this price gap (which has been averaging 10%) and incentivize holding of CRETH2 whilst receiving staking rewards.

['Proposal: Add BZRX as Collateral Asset'],"Cream Finance Proposal for BZRX
Summary
bZx is a financial primitive for shorting, leverage trading, borrowing, and lending that empowers decentralized, efficient, and rent-free blockchain applications. Borrowing can be done through the Torque dapp while the Fulcrum dapp handles lending and margin trading.
The bZx Protocol is currently the protocol to offer native margin trading for a wide variety of assets, and our unique architecture ensures the gas fee associated with using bZx does not increase along with the number of assets supported by the platform:

Margin trading, not just lending/borrowing
Many of the most desired assets, secured by Chainlink
Indefinite term loans with fixed interest rates
Tokenized lending and margin positions

For: List BZRX
Against: Do nothing
Abstract
Fulcrum enables users to collect interest by lending assets, and to enter into tokenized long or short positions at up to 5x leverage. Fulcrum 2.0 was launched in 2020 and is twice as gas efficient as its predecessor. Also built with bZx, Torque is a DeFi platform for borrowing assets instantly, with indefinite-term loans and fixed interest rates.
The most important thing that sets the bZx Protocol apart from other decentralized lending protocols is its commitment to developing the most decentralized solution possible.
Background

Token Symbol: BZRX
Audited by: PeckShield & CertiK

Stats

Total Value Locked: USD 19.3M
24 hour BZRX trading volume: 20MM via Coingecko
24 hour Fulcrum trading volume: 3-8MM (via KyberStatsBot)
Token Holder Distribution as of December 21st, 2020:

Over 6,000 holders. 10.3% held by the largest address, ~10% held by the next largest 10 addresses, and the rest are small holders. Data excludes exchanges and contracts.

Motivation
bZx’s presence on Cream would provide additional TVL to Cream and an opportunity to earn additional fees as bZx holders would come to Cream to collateralize their assets.
bZx’s presence on Cream will attract users towards the platform because bZx is one of the oldest and most well known protocols in DeFi. Over the years, bZx has amassed a community that believes in the protocol and who would be happy to use the Cream platform to collateralize their assets.

['Reward Plan for CRETH2 Liquidity'],"Summary
Approve 12.8k CREAM reward for bootstrapping CRETH2 liquidity.
For: Approve 12.8k CREAM reward for CRETH2 liquidity
Against: Do nothing
Motivation
To avoid potential risk and exploit, the protocol needs CRETH2 liquidity to be stable at a certain level. However, the initial reward plan will end by 11/25 00:00 UTC +8. Without CREAM reward, it’s quite possible that the liquidity will go down, reducing the liquidity available for liquidators should that need arises. That’s why we need a new plan for CREAM reward for CRETH2.
Community member Sherlock made the suggestion in Longer incentive for CRETH2/WETH liquidity provider and the core team agrees with this view of extending incentives for CRETH2 liquidity pool.
Specification
The reward plan is to distribute 12.8k CREAM in total. This 12.8k includes the first, ongoing 6k CREAM distribution (3k CREAM in CRETH2 and 3k in CRETH2/WETH pool).
After the first-week reward is over:

"[""A Workaround for those who want to use CREAM'S BSC-variant but cannot use Binance!""]","Hey y’all. So I had against my better judgment continued to use regular ol’ Binance.com as opposed to Binance.us for years. It was never an issue until New Years Day. When I logged in I was given an ultimatum that said (in so many words):

We noticed that you’re in the US! You’re not supposed to be here, goofy! We’ve disabled your deposit privileges but you have 14 days to withdraw your remaining funds before we close your account. Now SCRAM!

Ok, it wasn’t that in-your-face, but still.
The problem here was that I still had a lot of funds on CREAM but they were all BSC-assets. What am I gonna do now…?! I have all these BSC assets and the only method I know to convert them back into ETH-assets would be to deposit them into Binance and withdrawal but now I can’t deposit! AAAH~!!
WELL FEAR NO MORE.
You folks may already have known about this program but I had not and it just saved my butt. It’s called “SafePal”. I downloaded it for Android and it allows you to convert between ERC20, BEP20, and even BEP2 and TRC20 assets fairly seamlessly! You just need some BNB to convert from BEP20s and some ETH to convert from ERC20s, etc etc.
A few things to keep an eye on:
They tend to have a minimum number of tokens you need to be converting. They don’t do a very good job of explaining that until you’re practically finished and just trying to convert your tokens. That said it generally isn’t that absurdly high.
The other thing to keep an eye on–and it’s not really as big of an issue as you might think on first glance–but for some reason not EVERY version of a token with ERC20/BEP2/BEP20 variants exists within the app. For example: For whatever strange reason you can mess with the ERC20 version of USDC, the BEP2 version of USDC, but NOT the BEP20 version. Huh…?
Weird eccentricities aside it’s a really well-made app and it’s fast as hell. So…yeah! If you ever find yourself in a situation where you can’t use Binance but you want/need to use BSC assets then this is a wonderful lil app to have at your disposal.

['The Use of 1.39M creamY Rescue Funds'],"The Use of 1.39M creamY Rescue Fund
Summary
Use the 1.39M creamY rescue funds in protocol development and improvements.
For: Use 1.39M funds in C.R.E.A.M. Finance protocol development and incentivize $CREAM / $USDC pool on SushiSwap
Against: Do nothing
Background
Two weeks back, we rescued $1.39 million liquidity locked in the creamY Swap pools. Of the $1.39 million, a significant portion was from fees generated by creamY Swap. However, as we began to unwind the funds we realized some portion was the result of an issue with the creamY oracle that returned the wrong price of cyUSD. Specifically, the oracle should have returned the actual price of cyUSD (total value / total supply), but instead returned a constant value of 1e18.
As a result, every user who previously provided liquidity to creamY Swap withdrew less than would have been returned were the oracle functioning properly. The good news is that these losses were slightly offset by the $CREAM rewards distributed to creamY Swap LPs.
We have rescued these funds (here is the transaction on Etherscan) and redistributed them to CREAM’s multisig contract. We are submitting a proposal to C.R.E.A.M. DAO that recommends we utilize these funds for the following:

$1 million treasury assets will be utilized for ongoing protocol development. The CREAM team will submit an annual budget to our governance platform for the approval of the CREAM community.
$390,000 will be allocated to an incentivized $CREAM / $USDC pool on SushiSwap. This pool will serve to “buy and make” $CREAM tokens. This will make CREAM the first protocol to execute on Joel Monegro’s vision to utilize buybacks for market-making rather than burning tokens.

The “buyback and burn” model is well known in crypto. However, once tokens are burned, they essentially destroy value for existing token-holders since these tokens could otherwise have been used to finance future development and growth. Tokens are capital assets that can be reused after they are bought back. One potential use case is to issue $CREAM from the treasury to incentivize future partnerships and other important community activity.
While we believe this is the best path forward for the rescued funds, we understand the importance of community governance and will submit a proposal along with this post to be voted on in the coming week.",14,327.8,2021-01-07

['Add DSD as a collateral asset'],"Summary:
Dynamic Set Dollar:
DSD is one of the fastest growing algorithmic stablecoins launched to date. DSD has a current market capatalization of $141.92 million & $38 million in “total” liquidity. The volume since inception (under two months) has exceeded $362,297,846.54 at the time of this writing.
The osculating design of the Dynamic Set Dollar protocol used to return it to the peg of $1.00 makes it an excellent candidate to be used as a colletral asset in all of decentralized finance.
Despite The DSD comminuity growing every day and millions being invested via options in the form of coupons; DSD is not a collateral asset on any defi money market protocols.
Précis:
DSD is a decentralized algorithmic self-stabilizing and censorship-resistant stablecoin without any collateral backing. Oracle-driven pricing for voluntary supply elasticity is used without having to trust third-parties. When valued over $1.00, the supply ramps up into expansion up to 10%. If the price falls bellow the peg of $1.00, mechanics incentivise investors to burn supply.
The goal of DSD is to create a truly permissionless, scaleable, stable store of value, that can be used as collateral in various decentralized finance platforms.
Regulation: 12/31/2020
Total Liquidity: $38,687,432
Token Supply: 141,915,031.35

Checkout https://www.dsd.tools for real-time satistics.
Introspection
With the explosion of growth in the DSD community, sheer trading volume & consecutive days/weeks trending on popular cryptocurrency websites such as dextools and coingecko, DSD would add significant TVL to CREAM. DSD would also bring many additional users to the CREAM Platform.

['Proposal: List FRAX as a Collateral Asset'],"Summary
Frax is a fractionally algorithmic stablecoin with a growing market capitalization, currently approximately $25 million, and approximately $10 million of daily trading volume. Frax is unique among recent stablecoin designs in that each FRAX stablecoin is always redeemable for $1.00 worth of assets from the Frax protocol. This keeps the price of FRAX in a relatively tight band around $1.00, making Frax an attractive collateral asset to borrow and lend against.
Frax offers the benefits of algorithmic stablecoins while minimizing the “death spiral” risk of a purely algorithmic design. As a collateral asset, Frax provides C.R.E.A.M. with the benefits of a decentralized stablecoin while achieving a high level of price stability. Frax is not currently listed as collateral on any other decentralized money market protocols. This presents C.R.E.A.M. with an opportunity to become an early hub of Frax related lending and borrowing.
Abstract
FRAX is a fractionally algorithmic stablecoin with a dynamic collateral ratio that adjusts based on the market demand for FRAX. Currently, each FRAX is collateralized by approximately $0.96 USDC and $0.04 of the Frax governance token, FXS. When the price of FRAX is at or above $1.00, the protocol gradually lowers the collateralization ratio of USDC to FXS. When the price of FRAX is below $1.00, the protocol gradually increases the ratio. FRAX can always be minted or redeemed by the protocol for $1.00 of assets, which counterbalances significant price deviations from the $1.00 target. Frax emphasizes a highly autonomous, algorithmic approach with no active management of the price stability function.
Existing decentralized stablecoin designs have either achieved stability through overcollateralization or scalability and capital efficiency but with high levels of volatility (regular 10-30% deviations from the $1.00 target). Frax combines the desirable properties of both approaches to create a decentralized, stable, scalable, and capital efficient asset that can serve as a general purpose digital money.
Liquidity
Total Uniswap Liquidity as of 12/27/2020: $47.2 million
24 Hour Trading volume: $10 million
Motivation
Frax is a rapidly growing project beginning the process of integration with existing DeFi protocols like C.R.E.A.M. By integrating FRAX, C.R.E.A.M. would add an attractive collateral asset that would likely expand platform TVL. It would allow users of C.R.E.A.M. to leverage existing assets against FRAX. Users would know that their FRAX liabilities can always be covered close to the $1.00 target by simply minting additional FRAX from the protocol if necessary.
The Frax community will also benefit from C.R.E.A.M. integration by increasing FRAX usage and the available lending / borrowing options for FRAX. C.R.E.A.M. could also help FRAX maintain its price target by presenting an arbitrage option if the price of FRAX exceeds $1.00.

['List Cover as a collateral asset'],"Summary
We would like to propose that COVER token be added as a collateral option for borrowing and lending.

For : List COVER as a collateral asset.
Against : Do nothing.

Background

Launched by: Cover Protocol
Token Symbol: COVER
Audited by: PeckShield & Arcadia

Protocol Specifications

Current Total Value Locked: $45M
Number of protocols currently covered: 21

Motivation
Cover Protocol currently provides coverage & protection options for CREAM users through pooled coverage by participating liquidity providers via Market Making and Coverage Providing. We would like users to be able to lend and borrow the COVER governance token.
Benefits for C.R.E.A.M:


Aligns further incentive to COVER token holders to provide liquidity for CREAM coverage.


Bring alignment to projects by giving COVER token holders an opportunity to use their tokens as collateral to provide further liquidity to the COVER protocol.


COVER token holders would add additional TVL to CREAM for additional fees as no other lending platform currently supports COVER.


Our strengths
Cover Protocol is currently the only coverage option in DeFi where the price of coverage is determined by the market (market based pricing). There is no KYC and coverage is fungible. The protocol has been built from a fair launch token distribution model meaning all development has been paid for by the team themselves. Given our low budget approach with high technical skills it allows us to also be very agile when needed in order to suit the fast changing space of DeFi. As we continue to develop with our full time team members, we will work to solve the coverage model to allow for a safer environment.

['Increase Empty Set Dollar Collateral Factor to 65% - Supply cap of $5M'],"For more background, please see the recently submitted proposal to add Empty Set Dollar as an asset to Cream for supply and borrow here
As of this writing, total liquidity for the ESD/USDC pair on Uniswap is $91M  and the trading volume over the last 24 hours exceeded $13M. There is also a large and growing community with a large and growing DAO-managed treasury.
To put this in perspective, the total liquidity for the $UNI token (the governance token of the Uniswap protocol) UNI/ETH pair on Uniswap is only $61M, and trading volume over the last 24 hours around $8.5M.
The depth of liquidity and volume gives me confidence in the security of this asset as collateral.
In addition, $ESD is a stablecoin with protocol designed to stabilize $ESD around $1.00. The volatility of expansion and contraction cycles has been reduced over time, and hopefully will continue to do so.
One could argue that the $ESD collateral factor should be in the same range as other stablecoins on the CREAM platform like DAI (70%), USDT (70%), USDC (75%), BUSD (75%); however, given that ESD is still early and itself uncollateralized, I recognize that there the collateral factor should reflect greater risks than these other assets. In addition, because ESD is still in early development and CREAM will be the first money market to list the asset, I recommend capping the $ amount of supply at $5 million, around 3% of the current $177M TVL on CREAM.",13,32.6,2020-12-17
['Increase Empty Set Dollar Collateral Factor to 65% - Supply cap of $5M'],"First, the proposal to launch ESD as a collateral asset on CREAM has passed here
I plan to submit a proposal to Snapshot for the above. However, the language around supply cap is incorrect relative to the function of the CREAM protocol. First, the supply and borrow caps are determined in the number of units of the underlying asset rather than $ values. So you cannot implement a supply cap of US$5 million, but instead a supply cap of 5 million ESD.
Second, the intention of this post was to introduce a cap on ESD borrow, rather than supply. The snapshot proposal will include a 5 million ESD.
To clarify, this means that no matter how much ESD is supplied to the CREAM platform - though CREAM TVL will increase and this ESD can be used to borrow other assets - only 5 million ESD from the ESD provided could be borrowed universally across the protocol.

['List BAC as collateral Asset'],"List BAC as collateral Asset
Summary
Basis Cash is a simplified implementation of the once-defunct Basis Protocol (basis.io) on Ethereum. Basis Cash aims to be the successor to Basis by first leveraging the current excitement around yield farming as a bootstrapping mechanism, and continuously making improvements to the current Solidity codebase.
For Basis Cash to justify its status as a Basis successor, there needs to be real-world use cases as a stablecoin other than yield farming BAS. While there is significant momentum and excitement around the protocol (achieving top 10 TVL on Uniswap in less than 3 days since launch), there needs to be enough utility for the Basis Cash system as a whole.
Thus, as an exciting first step towards bringing Basis’ true vision into life, we propose adding BAC to CREAM Finance as a collateral asset - significantly improving usability as a stablecoin for BAC, and giving CREAM holders the opportunity to be the first platform for Basis to be widely adopted.
For: List BAC as a collateral asset
Against: Do nothing
Abstract
The Basis Cash protocol is designed to guarantee Basis Cash tokens to be exchanged at 1 USD, with the stability mechanism matching the supply and demand of Basis Cash tokens.
Every 24 hours, the time-weighted average of the BAC-DAI exchange rate is read from the Uniswap v2 contract, which is then fed into the Basis Cash protocol to be referenced by its stability mechanism.
The stabilization mechanism is triggered whenever the price of Basis Cash is observed to be above / below (1+ε) DAI, where ε is a parameter that defines the range of price stability for the BAC token. On launch, ε is set to be 0.05.

['Proposal: List Empty Set Dollar (ESD) as a Collateral Asset'],"Summary:
ESD has been one of the fastest growing algorithmic stablecoins launched to date. Its market capitalization has grown to nearly $200 million in the 3.5 months since its inception. As the market capitalization has increased, so too has the number of unique addresses holding ESD, the liquidity of the asset, and the avg. daily trading volume.
The unique mechanism design of the Empty Set Dollar protocol makes it a strong candidate to become one of the largest stable collateral assets in the decentralized finance ecosystem.
In spite of its large & growing community and adoption, unlike other stable assets like USDC, USDT, and DAI, ESD is not yet listed as collateral on any decentralized money market protocols. In order to grow their TVL and generate more usage + to improve the overall effectiveness of the DeFi ecosystem, C.R.E.A.M. should add supply and borrow for ESD.
Abstract:
Empty Set Dollar (ESD) is an algorithmic, seigniorage-based stablecoin that utilizes fixed protocol rules on supply expansion as well as a unique coupon creation + redemption model to incentivize trustless coordination between selfish participants that maintain ESD’s synthetic peg 1:1 with the US dollar all on-chain. Unlike other algorithmic stable coins like AMPL, ESD does not rebase all balances using non-standard functions, but instead adjusts supply through other mechanisms, allowing ESD to have the same composability as other standard ERC20 tokens.
Currently, crypto lacks a truly decentralized and censorship-resistant stablecoin. While DAI and sUSD come close, they currently have vulnerabilities in their architecture. The goal of ESD is to create a truly permissionless, scaleable, stable store of value, that can be used as superfluid collateral in DeFi.
**Liquidity:
Total Uniswap Liquidity as of 12/14/2020: $76.3 million
24 Hour Trading volume: $13.9 million
Token Holder Distribution:
As of 12/14/2020 there are currently over 446 unique addresses holding ESD; however, this does not calculate the large # of addresses currently staked in the DAO / LP
Check out: www.esd.tools for more network statistics
Motivation:
ESD has one of the most active and rapidly growing communities of any stablecoin in the market, yet is underrepresented relative to it’s market capitalization on existing DeFi protocols like CREAM. Adding ESD to CREAM will likely expand the platform TVL.
It would also benefit the ESD community by increasing offering the ability for speculators to take a short position in the asset, thus creating a new mechanism to stabilize the price of the ESD token when its TWAP sits above the $1 target. Finally, accelerating the growth of ESD would enhance the antifragility of the entire DeFi ecosystem due to ESD’s unique characteristics relative to other stable assets.

['**Proposal: Add TBTC as collateral Asset **'],"Joint Proposal by @ramaruro, @benlongstaff and EstebanK
Summary
We propose to add TBTC to CREAM for lending and borrowing.
TBTC is a fully Bitcoin-backed ERC-20 token pegged to the price of Bitcoin.
TBTC release candidate 1 went live in September 2020 and currently has $32M in TBTC locked.
Benefits for CREAM
New user base: Each Bitcoin on Ethereum project brings with it a community who resonate with the projects values. This proposal will allow the CREAM TVL to expand, and the TBTC community to borrow other Assets against their TBTC.
Additional strategies: As CREAM starts to collaborate with the Yearn Ecosystem  there might be additional opportunities to use TBTC through CREAM.
Diversity of choice for BTC based Collateral: Currently CREAM supports

HBTC (Huobi BTC)
BBTC (Binance Wrapped BTC)
RenBTC

TBTC offers an alternative that has been fully decentralised from launch.
Benefits for the general DeFi Community
Bring Optionality to the DeFi Community with a decentralized Bitcoin Exposure.
Decentralized Assets are essential for DeFi to stay “Decentralized”. It is important to keep that prospective in mind as a lot of liquidity based on Centralized Assets has flown into the DeFi Ecosystem.
Details about TBTC
The tBTC system is developed by the Keep Network.
tBTC is

Decentralized
Trustless
Permissionless
Fully collateralized
Open Source
Audited

Each bitcoin deposit is stored in a separate wallet created by the signers. The protocol has strong economic security measures. Depositors don’t have to trust custodians, aka signers, because signers deposit an ETH bond higher than the value of the BTC they hold in custody.
In the event that signers colluded to steal BTC the network would seize their ETH bond (150% of the BTC they have signed for) and slash their KEEP stake by the minimum stake amount (currently 70,000 KEEP).
The permissionless nature can be summed up by:
Question - “How many doors would you have to kick down to stop my TBTC being redeemed for BTC?”
Answer - “Good luck finding the doors”

['[Proposal]: List oBTC as Collateral Asset'],"Proposal: List oBTC as Collateral Asset.
A proposal by BoringDAO community, Contact us: info@boringdao.com
Summary
List oBTC as the collateral asset.
For : List oBTC as a collateral asset
Against : Do nothing
Background
Launched by: BoringDAO
Backed by:
oBTC is backed by BTC in 1:1 ratio
Smart Contract:
oBTC

Audited by: PeckShield
oBTC is an ERC-20 token issued by BoringDAO representing a 1-to-1 peg to actual Bitcoin, which can be minted or redeemed by anyone. It is built to unlock the productive value of Bitcoin on the Ethereum network and bring additional collateral to DeFi. Unlike other wrapped versions of Bitcoin, oBTC adopts a triple pledged mechanism (Underlying Bitcoin + Pledged Collaterals + Insurance) that maximizes its safety. What it means is that any oBTC is backed by at least 150% collateralized asset + insurance.
For the securitization of the underlying Bitcoin, we are using a multi-sig wallet that is controlled by the community. On the smart contract layer,  oBTC tunnel operators provide wETH, USDT, DAI, BOR, and other ERC-20 Assets as collateral assets. In the instances of black swan events (such as the loss of the underlying Bitcoin), the collateralized assets will be liquidated and used to compensate oBTC holders. Therefore, oBTC holders are 100% asset protected.
For insurance, BoringDAO has partnered with both Cover Protocol and Nsure to provide boringDAO coverage. These decentralized insurance protocols can provide extra protection to the underlying Bitcoin if needed. In summary, every minted oBTC is backed by 1 Bitcoin (100%) + extra ERC-20 asset (50%) + decentralized insurance.
One unique feature that differentiates BoringDAO from other wrapped BTC is that it uses the”OP_Return” feature from Bitcoin wallets to link Users’ BTC address to their Ethereum address. This approach ensures that there is a low risk of single-point failure as we do not use centralized servers.
Motivation:
In the 3 weeks since launch, BoringDAO has managed to receive USD25mm TVL and minted 603 oBTC for its users. This exceptional performance has propelled us to the 7th most popular BTC-pegged token on DeBank.
Concurrently,  Boring community has also partnered with DODO, Nsure, Bounce and Cover, to add more use cases for oBTC. BoringDAO’s near term goal is to facilitate more oBTC minting by adding more incentives and security measures for our users (expand multi-sig signers from 3 to 5 and integrate with more decentralized insurance protocols).
We believe add oBTC as collateral will be synergistic to both parties. BoringDao will be able to gain wider audience exposure, while C.R.E.A.M can unlock borrowing volume and fees to its holders as it participates in our growth.
Overall, BoringDAO is actively seeking more use cases for oBTC and could bring more users and volume to DeFi protocol.
Benefits for C.R.E.A.M


Bring extra BTC assets and liquidity to C.R.E.A.M.


Provide multiple BTC options for C.R.E.A.M to improve overall robustness.


Establish a channel between oBTC users, making C.R.E.A.M the default lending protocol.


The whole community would love to see oBTC could obtain better liquidity through C.R.E.A.M, so that users would have more usage scenarios. This proposal would bring spread income and incentives to the C.R.E.A.M protocol.
Our strength
Security: triple pledged mechanism (Underlying Bitcoin + Pledged Collaterals + Insurance) that maximize safety.
Community driven has attracted more talents and DeFi participants in BoringDAO’s community
The rapid growth of our TVL and exposure in DeFi community.
Here’s the list we are going to add oBTC in the coming weeks:
Badger
Curve
Sushi
Pickle
Fortube

['Did CREAM become a joke?'],"Did this coin become a joke now?
Seriously, what’s going on with Cream?

It was supposed to be DAO. Merging with Yearn was decided by devs without any vote. Noone cared because it was followed by immediate pump and dump.
Are we pump and dump coin now?
SWAG delisted - once again, without any voting. Don’t get me wrong, I was against listing Swag (check my post history), but DAO voted otherwise, so I respect that, and now devs decide to delist it like that.
And people that decided to delist SWAG (stating it is for security reasons) were the same people that just recently hyped SWAG - note the devs made huge announcement when they were listing Swag, all the people that promoted CREAM were promoting SWAG, swap 2.0 was launched especially for SWAG… now the same people are saying they are delisting it for security reasons? After sucking out funds from Cream? And according to this article, it was not the first time: https://coin.fyi/news/ethereum/warning-cream-another-defi-scam-by-people-behind-wifey-scam-i6jetr


Bottomline: CREAM looks like one man’s show. Dev (or the team) is doing as they please for their own personal gain and they change the rules on the fly. And to shut people’s mouth they orchestrate pumps and dumps. Disappointing.
Am I happy with Yearn Finance partnership? Yes.
Am I happy with reducing Swag’s collateral? Yes.
Am I happy with CREAM team promoting Swag and clearly using it to manipulate people here? No.
Am I happy with CREAM being a one man show? No.

Why some important choices are made without voing?
Why were you promoting Swag and now you consider it dangerous? Don’t you care about your reputation?

What’s the teams opinion on Swag - if they think it is scam and Machi created it to suck out funds from Cream, why have they supported it and promoted heavily. If Swag is legit, then why delist it?

For some reason Jeffrey Huang and Cream team promoted it very hard (on Discord, Twitter, everywhere). Some with regular shillers like Boxmining. They listed it on Cream, used for collateral and when people discovered their plan, they are delisting it, running away with more than 6 million USD and leaving behind people that lost 4/5 of their funds. You can check on Discord history, that Jeffrey Huang personally vouched for Swag and were saying not very nice things to people who doubted Swag. What’s with those double standards? This definitely needs investigating. Is Swag a scam (and therefore Jeffrey is a scammer for promoting it) or is Swag 100% legit and Jeffrey and Cream have some plans to develop it further and help the price regain the value of 30 cents (why delisting then?)?

We’re a community of over 1500 engaged members working together to make cryptocurrency index products that make investing simple and safe.
DeFi+L  is PieDAO’s large market cap DeFi index, containing the market leaders dominating this emerging ecosystem.

PieDAO

image428×574 24 KB
Unlike other products DeFi+L automatically rebalances, constantly locking in profits as prices fluctuate. There is currently $1.8m of liquidity
The index can also be farmed in the DAO’s staking contract, giving 67% APR currently.
Methodology
It is constructed using a market cap weight focused methodology, giving large cap tokens a bigger share. This gives the advantage of greater liquidity and maximises the size the index can grow to.
DeFi+L ERC-20 tokens are fully backed by the underlying assets, with the smart-contract sourcing the tokens from markets such as Uniswap when pies are minted. There’s no upper limit to the size the pie can grow, and the tokens are instantly redeemable for the underlying assets at any time.
More Information
DeFi+L has been fully audited by Quantstamp & MixBytes, highlighting no medium or high risk issues.
Why Add DeFi+L?
DeFi indices are rapidly becoming popular, giving broad exposure to one of the fastest growing segments of the crypto space. While DPI has already been included, DeFi+L is a vastly different product, both in terms of composition and rebalancing strategy. DeFi+L does’t go through a rebalancing process, it constantly moves to maintain the set allocation, locking in profits every day.
Just as DeFi indices minimise risk and provide opportunity through diversification, I believe Cream would benefit from diversifying their DeFi index offerings. As DeFi+L has been the best performing DeFi index on the market I think it would be a valuable addition for users of the platform.",33,401.6,2020-12-07

My questions are:


Does this mean that Jeffrey Huang and his friends from Swag (Sam) are not intending to pay that money back to Cream? Did they just stole couple million USDT from Cream users in an elaborately orchestrated scam by Jeffrey Huang and his team?


As many people asked already: if Swag is a scam, why Jeffrey Huang promoted a scam. If it is not a scam, then why delist it after borrowing such amounts of funds. It looks like they are delisting it so they are no longle liable to pay back those funds. What is even more worrying, recently Jeffrey Huang did the same with another of his tokens, Wifey, which was also listed on Cream and used to steal funds from Cream users. There were many articles warning that Cream team is going to do this again, including this one, and it was never explained: https://coin.fyi/news/ethereum/warning-cream-another-defi-scam-by-people-behind-wifey-scam-i6jetr


Why Jeffrey Huang and Swag try to deny any connections to each other? It is easy to find interviews and articles where Jeffrey Huang is described to be person behind Swag.live (along with Sam Lee). Jeffrey’s previous coin, Mithril, was used on Swag.live. So why denying the connection now? Is Jeffrey Huang and Cream team trying to make Swag a scapegoat for this theft of funds from Cream platform?


Yes, those are serious accusations, but so is the situation.
Jeffrey Huang and Cream team basically vouched for Swag (they were connected with the project after all) and now they are using it as some kind of scapegoat and want to distance from itself.
Solution is simple:
1 - if Swag is legitimate project, Cream team and Jeffrey Huang are expected to support it.
2 - if Swag is an attempt to steal funds from Cream by Jeffrey Huang and his team, then they are expected to pay it all back and explain why they attempted to scam Cream users",4,285.8,2020-12-02

['Longer incentive for CRETH2/WETH liquidity provider'],"Hi cream community
I think the incentive for CRETH2/WETH liquidity provider is too short. The liquidity in this pool is the most important one if we want to list CRETH2 as a collateral. Because in the event of liquidation, we need to liquidate CRETH2 through this pool and if the liquidity is not enough then the slippage will be very high. This will disincentive people to use CRETH2 as collateral and thus disincentive people to deposit ETH. Which is not good for cream. So I hope we can increase the incentive to last for at least a month.

Motivation
Soon the team will launch a new product CRETH2 to enable the community to involve in ETH2. This product will allow users to stake ETH and become part of Validators of ETH2. Contracts and details will be revealed before voting.
There are two motives to stake in CRETH2:

Validator will be rewarded with ETH returns in ETH2. Total reward rate is ranging from 5.36% to 22.97%. Details can be found here.
When you stake ETH, you’ll get CRETH2 as IOU token in return, and it can be used as collateral asset in C.R.E.A.M. Lending

The second motive is the main idea of this proposal.
In the end, people will migrate from ETH to ETH2, but here we offer another usage of your ETH during the migration. By listing CRETH2 as collateral asset, there will be more benefits for participating in ETH2 through C.R.E.A.M. Finance.

"['Backdoor in Cream, risk of stealing all supplied funds, Swag promises']","As most of you are probably aware, recently vulnerability in CREAM platform was discovered.
Swag token was added as collateraliable asset with 50% collateral ratio.
Problem is that swag is completely centralised asset, with many millions tokens already created and minting function in smart contract active. That means entity controlling Swag can borrow 100% funds from CREAM and never pay them back (they would lose their swag tokens, but they could create more anyway).
Community predicter this vulnerability before even Swag was listed.
They wanted to prevent the listing but it was listed anyway, supposedly by DAO vote. In reality big whale decided on the listing. Who is that whale? More on that later.
Then the community wanted to delist Swag or TEMPORARILY reduce it’s collateral ratio (until the project is proven legit and not threatening to the platform). It was almost delisted, but then again, last minute vote from whale account prevented it happening.
Here is where it gets complicated. Both Cream and Swag were co-created by the same person - Jefrey Huang, also known as Machi. Community members investigated and realised that for whatever reason Machi tries to distance himself from both projects, pretending they were never controlled by him, but it is easy to find Machi’s involvement in both projects.


google.com



swag.live huang - Google Search





Some members of the community believe, Swag was created as a backdoor to Cream, so Machi and his associates can suck out all the deposited coins at any moment. Probably they will not do it all at once, because that would be blatant scam, but they are slowly sucking out funds. 4 millions USD were sucked out before this vulnerability was described, and then on the day additional 2 millions were sucked out.
For the benefit of the platform the scam needs to be exposed and Swag collateral ratio changed to 0%.
Problem is, that since Machi and people associated with both projects control most of the coins, so they basically control Cream DAO. Obviously they control also Swag DAO. They just within an hour unlocked significant amount of locked tokens, supposedly by decision of the DAO (themselves).
We as a community don’t stand a chance to fix this vulnerability, becasue we always get outvoted. Luckily some of the whale accounts are now known, so we know when the team and their associates are voting.
And now the most important part.
CEO of Swag made couple of promises.
He understands that he could single-handedly destroy the whole platform and he understands that the community knows that.
But he wants to prove his intentions are fair and he is not willing to do that.
Those are quite high stakes and huge risk for the platform, but he made some specific promises that can be held accountable for. If we can’t remove Swag from Cream, we can at least monitor if the promises were delivered. If yes, then we can give the guy benefit of a doubt. If not, then we have to make sure this story is described in all the crypto outlets and Jefrey Huang, Sam and all the other people involved in this (including promoters like Wilson or Boxmining) are punished accodringly. Authorities in respectable countries should be notified, because this might turn out to be one of the biggest scams in crypto.
So the promises made by people behind Swag/Cream are as follows:

Launch liquidity pool rewards on Cream (this one is already delivered)
Get Swag listed on first tier CEX-es as a proof they are in this long term and actually want to spend money and effort on the project and not simply use it to drain funds (this is not deliverd yet)
Bring the price back above 30 cents by the end of this month and support it there. 30 cents is important price for the project, because that’s where the price was before the alleged scam was discovered, then it started to go down to 5 cents. Swag is planning to do this by various means, including buybacks. Someone on their Discord took a printscreen as a proof they are planning to do this till the end of the month, so this promise is easiest to verify and if they fail to deliver it, then we know they were scammers.
Pay back all the loans eventually (no specific timeline, so hard to verify this one).

['Decrease SWAG Collateral Factor'],"I agree.
Swag.live is legit business with actual revenue.
Swag token is solid way to participate in their DAO and grab some of that revenue.
But the Swag token itself:

has zero interest from the buyers (check volume on Uniswap)
dumped already 70% (was 35 cents after launch)
is not listed on any solid exchange
was never distributed fairly (devs got most of it, and can dump at any time, not saying that they will, though)

Listing it on the Cream Swap? Maybe, because it is a token connected with legit business after all. And Machi is part of both projects.
But listing it on Cream as a collateral? That should never had happened. Swag devs could use their token to drain all the other valuable tokens from Cream. Collateral factor should be 0%.
I understand why it was initially listed:

there was incenvitve for Swag/Cream pools
Machi is associated with both projects

But now, with incentives over I don’t think there is any reason for Swag to remain listed on the platform as a collateral. Actually it could be dangerous for the whole project.
It will be hard to vote this one out because some Cream whales are behind Swag, but let’s try.

Yeah, Swag looks like elaborate scam and should be totally delisted from Cream.
Or at least lower it to 0%.
One thing that is worrying is that when you google Swag.live + Huang you will see that Machi is involved with Cream and Swag. Mithril (his previous coin) was used as mean of payment on Swag.live. So it will be very hard to delist Swag from Cream platform because Machi will probably defend it hard, but perhaps other people involved in the project will help to delist it.
They used SWAG token to suck out 5 million USD worth of coins from Cream platform.
And I don’t think they will return it. Swag token is basically worthless, dumped to 10 cents already, so they can just take what they borrowed and not return it.

what you want is a win win scenario. cream community earns high interest rate, good projects, profitable projects who list their assets on cream, their communities get to use cream for liquidity. cream reserve makes the spread, distribute to all cream holders. what you can do is to participate in the swag dao, have the cream commnuity participate, make it a win win for both. i’m sure the swag community would be more than happy for this to happen. lowering it or removing it just hurts the whole ecosystem.

Actually noone borrows. Only people using Swag are their own devs, that are siphoning funds from Swag, as it was proven above. They stole 6,5 million funds that way. They will never pay it back, becasue they have almost unlimited amount of their own token (and they can mint as much as they want, that function is still unlocked in their smart contract). So they could easily take all the supplied assets from Cream.

['Decrease Reserve Factor for CREAM'],"Derived from the topic “Disable CREAM borrowing”, here comes an idea to enhance CREAM valuation by decreasing reserve factor of CREAM




Disable CREAM borrowing Proposal


    That would be a good compromise, a maximum borrow percentage (i’m thinking 25%)  of total supply. 
That would reduce hostile takeover impact but still let lenders gain interest income. 
Also lowering Reserve Factor for CREAM to increase rates for lenders. 
The idea is to enhance Cream token valuation.
  


I do agree with @goldenboy’s argument on this, but I think we also need more discussion too. Besides, it’s another good practice apart from the one (borrow cap for CREAM) in the original topic. It deserves another topic to discuss with the community without distraction.

What’s Good in It?
Decreasing reserve factor of CREAM does reduce protocol gains.
However, in the longer term, it incentivizes CREAM supplier to put more CREAM in the protocol by rewarding them with higher supply rate, leading to a lower level of utilization rate under the same condition, and the borrow rate would be lower accordingly. That’s the reason we want to decrease reserve factor to relocate the resource in it’s best possible way.
In short, it extends the availability of CREAM and increase economic efficiency in C.R.E.A.M. Lending.
Why CREAM, not Other Token?
It’s our token. The token of this protocol. If there’s any token worth implement a better condition, that would be CREAM.

Would love to get more feedbacks from the community ",6,106.2,2020-11-13
['Decrease Reserve Factor for CREAM'],"Well said: Our token, Our protocol. As more CREAM token will get unlocked in the coming weeks, it deserves better attractiveness both on interest rates and borrowing power for holders to remain vested.
Reserve Factor is currently at 40%, Ideally a halving to 20% Reserve factor would boost rates.
Also Collateral Factor which currently sits at 45% could be upped. The quantum could be decided by vote. So multiple options would be listed on the voting proposal.",5,46.0,2020-11-17
"['creamY launch, compensation for excessive slippage, before UI slippage controls were added']","Summary:
On September 24 the creamY platform launched, and a number of users within the first ~24 hours suffered large slippage on their deposits before the pools became balanced.
The dev team changed the UI to add slippage controls & warnings approximately 48 hours after launch, to prevent future users from suffering the same problem with excessive slippage.
As each case is different, we will submit a separate proposal for each case
Case 1	creamY deposit	 loss=$51,508.21	slippage=23.68%
Case 2	creamY deposit	 loss=$24,466.82	slippage=11.86%
Case 3	creamY deposit	 loss=$150,397.12	slippage=5.51%
Case 4	creamY deposit	 loss=$8,581.35	slippage=1.98%
Case 5	creamY deposit	 loss=$5,240.29	slippage=1.86%

Case 11	creamY withdraw	 loss=$54,502.32	slippage=13.04%
Action Item:
for each case:
FOR - Compensation should be paid from Cream treasury funds
AGAINST - Compensation should NOT be paid from treasury funds
Background:
The dev team determined that the platform was working correctly, but large slippage was possible during the launch phase while the pools were unbalanced, and adequate warnings and slippage controls should have been added to the user interface.
The UI was changed to add slippage controls & warnings approx 48 hours after launch.
A google spreadsheet was set up for approx 10 days to collect data from affected creamY users.
Every user who added themselves to the google form has a separate proposal, as every case is different, it is up to the community to decide which cases should be compensated.
Earlier proposals were submitted before the recent changes to DAO voting rules,  but the vote was inconclusive (less than 15k votes).
We are resubmitting now that locked Cream is eligible to vote.
Snapshot date will be 16 November.
Motivation:
Fairness, help early adopters who supported creamY platform.
The original UI didn’t include slippage controls & warnings.
The creamY Medium articles did not mention the risk of high slippage before the pools became balanced
Positive PR opportunity, “Cream supports its community”

Disable CREAM token borrowing on C.R.E.A.M.

Cream token borrowing being the native governance token of CREAM, can be temporarily borrowed to  vote for proposals. Thus an actor who owns no cream token, need merely borrow to vote for his/a proposal and repay it back. An actor who owns CREAM is less inclined to put proposals that may harm Cream protocol.
Disabling borrowing also prevents from aggressive Shorting, which is more favorable to CREAM holders in terms of pricing.

['Proposal to add Zcash (renZEC) on the Ethereum money market'],"Abstract
Zcash (renZEC) liquidity has been growing steadily on Ethereum since it became possible to wrap it, and has increased 10x in a month, signaling an organic interest in utilizing it within the DeFi ecosystem. Given its limited integration by other protocols, C.R.E.A.M. has an opportunity to capture the lending and borrowing market for this asset. renZEC’s recent whitelisting on Balancer already supports earning yield on the asset, and its consideration by MakerDAO to be added as a collateral type further strengthens the case that this asset will find a home on Ethereum, especially when listed by C.R.E.A.M.
Ren Project Background
The Ren Project launched RenVM, a byzantine fault-tolerant network that is able to securely in a decentralized manner do ECDSA threshold key generation and signing via sMPC, which allows RenVM to securely manage (ECDSA) private keys of different assets like Bitcoin and Zcash, and wrap these assets on smart-contract chains like Ethereum (soon also Binance Smart Chain and other chains). Since launch, RenVM has processed around $1B in total volume of Bitcoin, Zcash and Bitcoin cash going to and from Ethereum.
RenVM is a decentralized crypto asset custodian that:

enables universal interoperability between blockchains: anyone can use RenVM to send any supported asset to any application on any supported host chain in any quantity.
has robust security*: large bonds, large shard sizes, and continuous shuffling make RenVM extremely difficult to attack, even for irrational adversaries. In the unlikely event of a successful attack, RenVM can restore lost funds through seizing bonds.
is scalable: as more assets are locked into the custody of RenVM, the algorithmic adjustment of fees allows RenVM to automatically scale its capacity to meet demand.
provides an optimal user experience: users can interact with multiple assets, applications, and chains with only one transaction.

*when rolled out in the next mainnet phases, currently the network is centralized to allow time for bootstrapping network security as more nodes in RenVM are coming online
renZEC is a tokenized representation of ZEC on the Ethereum blockchain. It is implemented as a standard ERC-20 contract, and backed 1:1 by native ZEC locked in RenVM, a decentralized custodian. It is redeemable at any time for native ZEC. Individuals can acquire renZEC by minting it with native ZEC via the RenBridge, or through trading it on decentralized exchanges.
The benefits of onboarding renZEC for C.R.E.A.M. include:


Being the first mover on supporting Zcash in Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem, supporting a cool asset which provides positive marketing about C.R.E.A.M., and capturing this asset’s money market on Ethereum


Creating pipes between C.R.E.A.M’s Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain money markets, as renZEC (and renBTC etc.) will be launched on Binance Smart Chain in the coming weeks, allowing for users of C.R.E.A.M. to easily move their loans or locked supply within C.R.E.A.M. on one chain to the other chain through the bridging by RenVM, fortifying C.R.E.A.M’s role within the DeFi ecosystem as the first cross-chain lending platform

Robert from Compound is leading what some (including me) believe is the right path forward for the benefit of Uniswap and possibly DeFi itself. Here’s Robert’s tweet for background: https://twitter.com/rleshner/status/1327054598519943168?s=20
A Poll on Twitter suggested a near 50/50 split on this: https://twitter.com/CreamdotFinance/status/1327127717079371779?s=20
Joseph Turner from DeFiPedia argues against this:

I would directly argue it is a protocol threat. As a user, if funds are delegated just by virtue of depositing, then my voice as a depositor is lost. It’s a broad stroke, rather than letting the individual make the choice.
Now, if they had an option for the users to sign a tx to vote for or against a proposal, and then delegate the user’s deposits accordingly (for and against both), That would retain the voice of the individual. We no longer have the technological limitations that require a broad stroke to coordinate, so to use it that way would be a misallocation of the abilities we now have.

Robert needs 10m $UNI to propose a vote. CREAM has ~3.9-million $UNI in the lending contract.
This brings about an interesting question - should we as a platform and community back any initiatives? Or stay neutral and out of other platform’s governance matters?
If this were to put onto a Snapshot vote and passes, does the core team have a responsibility to implement this delegation? Or protect the platform from getting involved in politics?
Would love to get community feedback here.

Here’s the list we are going to add BBTC in the coming weeks: Uniswap, Aave, Curve, Compound, Cream, Fortube(Listed), MakerDao, Balancer, InstaDapp, and more.
(will keep you updated under this thread)
Benefits for [Cream] and the general DeFi Community
Larger User Bases and Liquidity Growth:
Binance is one of the largest crypto exchanges, and >15m Binance communities can potentially contribute to the DeFi ecosystem. BBTC will become an important bridge between CeFi and DeFi worlds, which will introduce quite decent liquidity in the DeFi ecosystem on Ethererum.
Risk Mitigation:
1)BBTC is an ERC20 token on the Ethereum network that represents a 1:1 peg of the same asset on their own blockchain.
2)Heightened security and risk control measures for the wrapped tokens are in place, as well as using the SAFU fund to ensure the safety of users’ assets.
BBTC might become an incentive token in the future. The holder will share the savings revenue of the BBTC they hold. (features are in design).
How to Exchange BBTC on Binance?
Binance.com users can deposit or withdraw BTokens by selecting the ERC20 network option in the Binance.com wallet when trying to deposit or withdraw. For example, BBTC is the BToken token representing BTC wrapped on Ethereum:
1)To withdraw BBTC, users need to select the ERC20 network and input an ERC20 address on the BTC withdrawal page.
2)To deposit BBTC users need to select the ERC20 network when depositing BTC and acquire the ERC20 deposit address for BTC.
Furthermore, In the mid of Nov, Binance Bridge can support to transfer in/out of the BTC from the bitcoin network to Ethereum or vice versa, which will need a Binance.com account.

Introduction of H-Tokens (HBTC & HFIL)
H-token series are a suite of assets issued on Ethereum and backed by cryptocurrencies from other blockchains to bring more digital assets to the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem.
The issuance of the H-Tokens will allow more users in the crypto world to benefit from DeFi, accelerate the development of the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem, and promote the growth of Ethereum-based assets.
HBTC as well as HFIL has enabled BTC and FIL users to seamlessly access Ethereum DeFi protocols such as Uniswap, Curve, Nest, CoFix, ForTube and more. And its growing use cases prove that the value has been recognized by the market.
Use Cases (examples):

Juan Benet, the founder of Filecoin, praised HFIL on Twitter, thinking that using HFIL and DeFi, anyone can migrate FIL to Ethereum and use smart contracts to handle various things. Miners can rely on DeFi infrastructure and loan market.
Juan Benet’s Twitter

HBTC pool is available on Curve since Sep 10th and liquidity providers can then deposit HBTC there to earn trading fee reward and CRV reward.
HBTC on Curve


How to Get H-Tokens (HBTC, HFIL)?
To meet users’ fast exchange of H-Tokens, Huobi Global will take the lead in supporting H-series. Users can choose HBTC (or other H-Tokens like HFIL) when withdrawing their BTC (or other original asset like FIL)
a)	Buy, deposit or get BTC through trading and save it in the Exchange account on Huobi Global
b)	Select BTC (or other original asset e.g. FIL) - Withdraw - HBTC (or other H-Tokens e.g. HFIL) in the Exchange account
c)	Enter the address and amount for withdrawal and click “Withdraw”

Benefits for C.R.E.A.M:
Huobi Group has maintained more than 15 million users in the world, and H-Tokens like HBTC as well as HFIL play the key roles to bridge the BTC and FILECOIN users to Ethereum ecology in participating the DeFi activities. And as witnessed, market needs of HBTC and HFIL jump sharply. Thus, having HBTC and HFIL listed on C.R.E.A.M would surely introduce quite a decent amount of liquidity to C.R.E.A.M and to benefit the growth of C.R.E.A.M. Let’s hold hands to achieve DeFi ecological prosperity.

['[Proposal] List NOW Token as Collateral Asset'],"Hello, C.R.E.A.M. Community!
We are the team behind the ChangeNOW, an instant crypto exchange service. In 2018, we’ve issued our very own token, $NOW and would like to put forward a proposal of integrating the NOW Token to the C.R.E.A.M. platform.
ChangeNOW is a non-custodial service created for simple and fast cryptocurrency exchanges. We always strive for maximum safety, simplicity, and convenience and have worked on $NOW with the same principles in mind.
NOW is the first native digital asset introduced by an instant exchange platform. It was designed to serve as an internal currency on the NOW products (NOWPayments, NOW Nodes, etc). At this moment, NOW is used as a means of payment for ChangeNOW’s Asset Listing Campaign and the platform’s own stakeable token. NOW Token exists on both the Ethereum and Binance Сhain networks and is currently traded on IDEX, Binance DEX, and Uniswap.
We think that providing users with an ability to lend, borrow, and deposit $NOW using C.R.E.A.M. is a great idea because NOW is a fast and inexpensive asset that can be used for trading and to get discounts in the upcoming ChangeNOW loyalty program.
Plus, integrating NOW Token to C.R.E.A.M. Platform will be beneficial for both communities as it will lead to bigger exposure for both projects.
More information about the $NOW Token can be found here:

['[Proposal] Increase Collateral Factor For DPI To 50%'],"Summary
Set DPI’s collateral factor to 50% based on the tokens inside the index that are already on CREAM.
Motivation
DPI is the leading DeFi index and CREAM should capitalize on our first mover advantage in listing it by allowing DPI depositors to borrow against it, bringing in more deposits and revenue to CREAM.
Description
For context here is the proposal to list DPI which has a lot of supporting data and evidence for this discussion.
Since it’s an index composed of tokens already in CREAM and other tokens inside the index are about to be listed on CREAM (e.g. SNX) DPI has effectively already been vetted by CREAM community. DPI should be considered the safest asset on CREAM outside of stables and ETH. I propose we copy the collateral factors of DPI’s underlying tokens as the initial collateral rate for DPI setting it at 50% LTV. Considering it’s more stable due to diversification and tokens are held 1:1 in reserve by a smart contract it should actually be substantially higher. Initially setting it equal to its components is a good precaution until DPI has a longer track record. Here is some data analysis on relative stability of DPI vs its underlying tokens and volatility compare to ETH:

More Diversify For the System
For Centralized stablecoins C.R.E.A.M. has supported, you can clear see the differences
By adding a new stablecoin asset with monthly auditing, regulated trust holding and different issuer, can lower down the sysmetic risk. Even one of the issuer gets any problem (regulation,compliance, business operation…), people can still use other stablecoin asset on C.R.E.A.M.

Attract New Users For C.R.E.A.M.
As HUSD has users in both centralized world and defi community, which is quite different from what USDT/USDC has,  it will brings C.R.E.A.M. more opportunities to landing new market.
Risk & Weakness
*The market cap and liquidity of HUSD is relatively lower than USDT, USDC and the liquidity is not good as USDT, USDC. so the Collateral Factor of HUSD should be set lower.

Listing centralized assets on a decentralized platform is kind of risky. However, there are still many centralized tokens we used every day in the DeFi world. Apart from USDT, USDC is also centralized (but more regulatory).
Back to the collateral factor, I agree with you that it’s hard to build trust. However, HUSD is issued by trusted company. To me, C5 (60%) and C6 (75%) is fine.",14,47.8,2020-11-06

Hi Harrrr,
I understand your concern, and here is my idea. I think at least for stablecoins backed by fiat assets, centralized issuance is not a problem. We should know the fact that, even for DAI, most used decentralized stablecoin, more than 40% of DAI is backed by centralized assets- USDC, TUSD, PAX…
image1148×197 17.9 KB
Fiat pegged stablecoins are special ones, they have to follow the AML and other regulations. Centralization is to fullfill the regulation/ compliance requirements, it’s a protection for the users in my point of view. Since fiat is still running in real world, and laws , regulations still matters there.

Summary
Celsius Token is currently in the Top-50 cryptocurrency list ($311m+ market-cap), it verified a constant increase in its price during the last couple of months. It should have a higher CF level in Cream Finance.

['Vote to Increase CEL Collateral Factor'],"Although I really love Celsius (I’m an active ambassador), I think CEL probably has a lot of the similar issues brought up about FTT.
It’s fairly illiquid (~$2-4m trading volume daily), and Celsius themselves also holds 150 million CEL in their treasury.

CRV - rank 144
SWAP - rank 2673

Let’s wait until tomorrow so we can have more opinions, and hopefully we’ll have a good discussion later.",19,13.8,2020-10-27
['Vote to Increase CEL Collateral Factor'],"Hello!
I agree with @dudesahn and would propose, for the success of the proposal and then snapshot, the OP (@jones2020) would edit the original post and the option “For: C4 with 45% CF”. Nevertheless, my vote would be 1000x certain in C5 or higher than C3 or lower.
From an analytical perspective, as user anything below CF:45% wouldn’t make sense this is why:

If you hold > 20% CEL in Celsius you get 30% bonus reward (Source)
USDT/USDC pays 11.55% or 15.26% (in CEL), this translates into 3.71 p.p.
Celsius Portfolio example - 1,000 USDT/USDC + 329 CEL (@1.30) => Annually, this portfolio would get ~$37 more, by having CEL in Celsius.
By having, at least C4 (45%) or more, this would allow to compensate for the opportunity cost of not having the CEL in Celsius. With CF 45%, depositing 329 CEL (@1.30) would allow a borrow limit of $192.
Assuming I borrow $192 in renBTC and put them in Curve+Pickle I would get, at the time of writing, 7.60% and paying 3.32%, netting 4.28 p.p. for $192 (45% of 329 CEL).
To summarise, the final (and maximum and risky) P/L for one operation as described would be lower  than 1.93% (4.28%*45%) for a C4 (CF 45%), so it’s “<1.93%” vs. “3.71%”. A lower than C4 would invalidate even more any practical usage for CEL in CREAM. (FYI: C5 (60%) would still make this a difficult decision - “<2.56%”

As a Cream user my goal is to maximise Cream’s usage (usage as a proxy via liquidity available), therefore I believe this type of analysis for token’s CF needs to be done and opportunity costs taken in consideration.

Due to the BCH hard fork on BSC coming on Nov 15, users in our protocol will be affected in different degrees. As protocol team, we can hardly take a firm stand on this issue. However, there are still two actions we can take.

Pause BCH borrowing to allow BCH supplier withdraw their token easier
Raise the borrowing rate of BCH to decrease its utilization rate

Both of them are to provide more liquidity for BCH supplier to withdraw. As a Defi protocol team, we cannot take any of the action unilaterally to provide liquidity just because someone is in need (though it’s a special case), unless the community gives a green light.

['Add DeFiPulse Index ($DPI) as a collateral asset to CREAM market'],"Summary
DPI is an index that tracks the top DeFi tokens, launched by the well known DeFi Pulse and Set Protocol teams. Adding $DPI as collateral to CREAM will give us a more stable collateral asset, give us revenue from a top 50 DeFi token (Coingecko Top 100 DeFi tokens) and allow DPI holders to leverage their position.
About $DPI
The DeFi Pulse Index is a digital asset index designed to track tokens’ performance within the Decentralized Finance industry. The index is weighted based on the value of each token’s circulating supply. The DeFi Pulse Index aims to track projects in Decentralized Finance that have significant usage and show a commitment to ongoing maintenance and development. It aims to be for DeFi what the S&P500 is for the U.S. stock market.
The index methodology is managed by DeFiPulse, one of the leading DeFi analysis websites, and runs on top of Set Protocol, an OG DeFi dapp with ~$26M TVL. The ETF itself is managed by a DAO called Index Coop, with DeFiPulse providing the rebalance weights and assets in accordance with their rigorous methodolohy. You can read about the methodology for how tokens are added and rebalanced for $DPI.
Stats:


$14M marketcap (elastic supply, tokens are minted/redeemed, maximum potential marketcap is sum of all DeFi token marketcaps in the index)
1,538 token holders (average ~$9,000 per holder)
$DPI currently controls ~0.3% of the total supply for all DeFi governance tokens
Over 90% of DPI is provided as liquidity on Uniswap
More DPI/ETH liquidity on Uniswap than the major tokens in the index
DPI/ETH is top 10 liquidity pools on Uniswap right now with $24M locked
2014×1212 313 KB


Motivation
I try to be an active contributing member to CREAM as much as possible and I think adding $DPI is a great opportunity for us. You guys may have seen me talk about CREAM before. I’ve proposed new UI designs, suggested we count timelocked CREAM in governance which was approved by governance (original twitter convo), and other general twitter shenanigans.
Why should CREAM add $DPI?

CREAM already lists ~50% of the tokens held in the $DPI index - YFI, UNI, LEND, BAL, and COMP
Because it is an index, DPI price is more stable than the underlying tokens making it a safer form of collateral.
DPI is one of the most liquid pools in Uniswap with over $20M making it a top 10 pool which means there is enough liquidity for liquidations on CREAM platform.
Substantial community support - Spencer Noon, David Hoffman (Bankless), DeFi Rate, $YAM, DeFi Dad, etc.
Control of $DPI was transferred to Index Coop DAO about two weeks ago so we have just started marketing, integrations, and business development (this proposal included). If CREAM is the first lending protocol to accept DPI then the DeFi whales we are targeting will come to CREAM over other protocols to leverage their $DPI positions in order to yield farm, do spread trades, short the market, go leverage long, and create structured products.

It would be dope if DPI deposits/withdrawals got CREAM rewards but that will be a secondary proposal if this one is passed and CREAM community/team is interested in doing so.
Before someone asks - no we can not add CREAM to the index unless it falls under our strict methodology which is managed by DeFi Pulse, not the Index Coop DAO.
Proposal
Until timelocked CREAM is counted in Snapshot I can’t make a proposal so I would appreciate if someone made a snapshot proposal for me (@lumberg?)

['Vote to remove 10% limit on price oracle token valuation change'],"Summary:
Currently the lending model is set up to update the real value of collateralized tokens, hourly, for token’s market value changes of up to 10%. This means that if a token that is being used as a collateral gets hit by something major, and it collapses to $0 or close to, it’ll take close to 30 hours before the actual collateralized value gets reduced to 5% value.
This is extremely risky. For example: If something like FARM were listed and it suffers the same hack that FARM did, and collapses by 70% in an hour, but Cream only accurately values it after almost after a day goes by. In this case, Cream’s TVL is exposed to massive risk without ability for liquidation to be done effectively to protect lenders.
Voting options
For: Remove artificial 10% limit on price oracle’s ability to update token valuation - With every price update, price oracle should always reflect actual market value of collateralized token
Against: Do nothing
Specification of “For” option:
Price oracle, no matter where the price is pulled from, should always reflect the price at that very moment and use that price to value the underlying collateralized token instead of having an artificial 10% limit on price changes.",14,22.8,2020-10-31

However, I still want to bring up a conversation here to discuss what else can we (community and the team, of course) do to make Proposal Rules and Governance better.
Issues
After the initial Proposal Rules have passed, there are some issues like this, and I’d like to bring up some major one.


Duplicate/Smiliar proposals with voting period overlapping
See proposal A and proposal B. It’s confusing for the community to vote in the right proposal, and what if proposal results are conflict to each other?


Voting without discussion
For example, the one mentioned in the beginning. Voting without discussion is quite a non-transparent move. There’s still something we can do to improve this procedure.


Voters are few
We do have lots of votes involved in the proposals, but most proposals are voted with less than 10 address. Offering opinions before voting is important.


I believe it’s better for us to discuss what’s serious issue and what’s not, instead of jumping to the solution directly. By raising the discussion of the Governance issues over and over again, we will come out with the prioritization and the solution.
Any other issue could be raised and discussed too. Feel free to leave comments below.",16,83.2,2020-11-04
['[post-discussion] Proposal Rules Change?'],"I think it has to do with the precedent set by CREAM team. They’ve always been transparent about decisions once they’ve already been made but not about the actual decision making process. They announce something is done and people react to it and it seems thats the approach people have taken to governance, they announce a vote (before or after it’s passed already) and expect CREAM team to react. I think that answers #2 and #3. Another reason I don’t think people feel compelled to vote is because there isn’t really a community and everything is clearly still controlled by CREAM team so why vote when it’s not really your decision anyway.
I made every effort to get community commentary and support for the DPI listing but at the end of the day the only thing that mattered was being annoying enough to get CREAM team to look at it.
There’s no one answer to solve this but I think 1. CREAM team having all discussions in the open about what they are thinking would go a long way and 2. making things more data driven so we can have real discussions instead of politics and actually drive the platform forward.
I’ve been using the app and following developments since the week it launched. It’s a cool platform and I like what they do from a tech standpoint but my perception is they don’t actually want community governance and I don’t appreciate the charade. If they need support then we should be using the protocol revenues to buy back CREAM and give it as incentives to devs and community leaders but from a culture perspective and the reputation garnered by the platform it’s an uphill battle to recruit that they’ll have to fix on their own.",12,2.4,2020-11-04

['[Proposal] Decrease FTT Collateral Factor'],"Summary:

Decrease the Collateral Factor for FTT (FTX Token) on C.R.E.A.M. lending.

Abstract:

This proposal will decide on the new collateral factor for FTT. As one of the very first C.R.E.A.M. snapshot votes here, it has already been decided collectively that we should decrease the collateral factor of FTX. Now we should decide what that new level will be, as well as how much time we should allow FTT suppliers to unwind their borrow positions as needed.

Motivation:

As previously discussed, FTT is an illiquid token that is overwhelmingly supplied on C.R.E.A.M. by one holder (Alameda/SBF). While there is nothing wrong with a holder utilizing existing collateral for borrowing, the illiquid nature of FTT puts the C.R.E.A.M. protocol at risk should we ever need to liquidate any of these borrowing positions.

Specification:

Using the collateral factors outlined here, I believe a reduction to at least C3 (25%) is necessary, but I would also be open to discussions/models justifying the even lower C2 (10%) as well.

Before finalizing my For and Against positions, I’d love to get some feedback from the community on choosing 10% vs 25% as the new collateral factor, as well as a reasonable timeframe to allow borrowers to unwind positions (and will likely set a precedent for any future reductions to collateral factor as well).",23,269.6,2020-10-27

These are people that have already committed to the long term success of Cream but with the current governance tools have absolutely no voting power. That’s a serious issue!!! We need to brainstorm the best ways to give these people a say in Cream governance. I assume we will want to keep using snapshot.page so it should be compatible with that tool.
So far ideas I’ve come up with:

Can we modify snapshot.page to also take snapshots of the locking contracts? That seems most reasonable but i don’t know feasibility. It also doesn’t add weight to people that staked for longer amounts of time.
Should we issue CREAM tokens proportional to amount locked at the beginning of yesterday? This is easiest but dumbest idea in my opinion, still works though.
Create a second governance token and airdrop to people? Seems overly complicated but it’s the least invasive option I can think of.

Dear community members, Cream hodlers and team members.
We need to establish a clear path going forward with community governance of the protocol.
The most important issues to settle first is in my opinion the following:
1 Establish rules for governance.
Who can vote for proposals?  Only cream from wallets, or also cream staked for 1-4-year contracts, and LP’s?
What is minimum quorum to pass a proposal?
2 Setup a guideline for proposals.
For instance, a proposal needs to have been discussed for at least 3 days on the forum/discord and have some community sentiment behind it to pe put up for a vote. In addition, the voting process should also run for 3 days.
3 Team need to be more engaged and give a rough guideline about what we can vote about.
Right now, we are in the dark about what areas of the protocol we can have community governance about. We could really use a guide from the team about which things they will give the community power to decide, and which things are possible to implement.
In my opinion these issues are particularly important to discuss and find a solution to before we can continue the transition to community governance.
This transition needs strong participation and guidance from the team, so we can build a framework to further build the community governance on.",34,861.8,2020-10-20

['Raise the CREAM threshold for listing proposals in Snapshot'],"Abstract
Raise the CREAM threshold for listing proposals in Snapshot
Summary
To make truly important and decisive proposal standout and reduce scam, voting experience might be better by raising the threshold of proposal listing in the landing page, which is the first page people see in Snapshot/Cream.
Background
Anyone can propose in Snapshot, and if you want your proposal listing in the landing page, you just need to hold at least 10 Cream when submitting the proposal. However, it results in listing too many proposals in the landing page and lowering the cost of scamming, distracting people from seeing important and decisive proposal to Cream.
Thus, a better solution might be raising the threshold of proposal listing in the landing page of Snapshot. Anyone can still propose, but the landing page will list only the proposal of Cream hodler with greater voting weight.
All proposals need a discussion in forum.cream.finance first, and no proposal would be weighted differently in the Forum still. What’s changed here is only affecting Snapshot, where people vote.
Action Items

['Allow Staked and Pooled CREAM to Vote #QmNvFox'],"Proposal to allow staked and pooled tokens to vote is now, up for a vote. Please use this forum space to discuss pros and cons, and follow the link to cast your vote.
Summary
Current design only allows CREAM in wallets to vote. This proposal seeks to approve a move to allow all Staked and Pooled CREAM tokens to vote.
Motivation
The current Snapshot design excludes some of the core, committed backers of the C.R.E.A.M. community from voting. These tokens may be in the Long-Term C.R.E.A.M. staking pools (1,2,3,4 years), or in LP positions on C.R.E.A.M. Swap/Balancer/Uniswap/Mooniswap etc.
Furthermore, not allowing these committed token holders to vote potentially exposes C.R.E.A.M. to voting attacks, where malicious parties may accumulate CREAM in the short term and sway a vote outcome.
crCREAM is excluded to avoid double-counting. Should there be a desire to add crCREAM, that can be a separate proposal.
Proposal

Allow CREAM token holders from all 4 of the Long-Term Staking pools to vote with their staked CREAM.
Allow CREAM token holders from the various CREAM liquidity pools to vote with their CREAM.

Follow the below link to cast your vote. You must have CREAM tokens in your wallet at block 11042011 to vote.
