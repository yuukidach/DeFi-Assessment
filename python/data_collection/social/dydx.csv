['Dydx Grants DAO'],"Hey @Evgeny Gaevoy | Wintermute , it's great to have your support on this initiative.

Yes, a Dydx Grants Program would manage the process. The program would provide funding to projects, ideas, and events that benefit Dydx and its stakeholders.

As an overview, this is how it works:

The Dydx treasury funds a multi-sig wallet capped at $Xmm quarterly. This multi-sig is controlled by the grants group.

The grants group is an N-member committee: 1 lead to orchestrate the program, and N-1 reviewing members. These are all independent community members that represent the key Dydx stakeholders (i.e. Investors, Market Makers, Traders & Stakers)

Grant applications are vetted by the lead, and then submitted to the review panel for funding.

To release funds, the multi-sig operates with N of M signatures. Only the reviewers can vote to approve any given grant application. The program lead does not participate in voting.

Projects must hit given milestones before more funding is released.

The lead's responsibilities include:

Setting up the program (this is generally fronted on Notion; see here , here & here )

Compiling a list of RFPs that the community can begin working on.

Being responsive to grant applicants for the duration of the program. (i.e. aiming for no more than a 2-week turnaround).

Vetting applications. Ensuring there are defined milestones set and that application details are filled appropriately, before submitting it to the review panel for funding.

This proposal is heavily inspired by Compound Grants Program .

Compound limited their pilot program to $1mm per quarter, had 7 reviewers, and a 4 of 7 multi-sig. I don't see why something similar wouldn't also work for Dydx.

I think we can bootstrap their initiative, whilst also taking their recent lessons learned & Messari's Blitzscaling thinking into account, and customizing the program to Dydx's needs. I will continue to research other grant programs with the view of putting forth a more formal proposal in due course.

Besides fleshing out details, we would need to decide on who should be part of the committee.

If anyone wants to DM me directly, please feel free to do so on Discord (itzr#9231)."
['Dydx Grants DAO'],I'd be supportive of that. Not super familiar with how it is organized in other communities though. Is there a Grants group that manages the process?
['Dydx Grants DAO'],Sounds like the right idea to get some velocity. Thanks for bringing this up and not stop trying to contribute. I also believe that tooling for governance and statistics is highly relevant for dydx to iterate faster on the community governance.

['Second Chance for L1 Historical Users?'],"Here's my proposal, trying to meet everybody's needs middle ground.

Cut out all of the first tier users

Price impact must be minimal. 80% of the non-claimed wallets are in this tier. Also, I bet most of the traders who traded multiple wallets are in this tier.

Give unlimited time to the users that are above those tiers

If you traded more than 1k$ on L1, and haven't been around that much lately, chances are you've been in crypto a long time. Maybe you've also built a following around yourself.

Take for example @defi_dad on Twitter. That guy went from tweeting about dydx with a lot of enthusiasm  one year ago, to posting not so optimism predictions  anymore. He's got 100k+ crypto twitter followers. We don't want those predictions to become self-fulfilling...

Also on Twitter, I noticed this adheres to the initial motivations from Antonio . In fact I was surprised to see no mention at all about any time limit in the 10+ tweet thread where he announces the retroactive-rewards program.

As a developer, I know the dev team will appreciate implementing one of the simplest solutions amongst the ones that were proposed up to now.

Last but not least, giving unlimited time also reduces price impact and sell pressure as there won't be any rush to get the tokens and sell them. E.g. one of the commenters in another thread about this  still has his 400 UNI.

I think with this proposal we have a chance to put this past us, and also make some green DYDX candles along the way. Maybe some candles who wound't have even been there otherwise.

Currently 1000 dollars trading fees gives multiplication factor = 1000^0.7 = 125.9

['Trading%20Reward%20System%20-%20Improvement%20Discussion'],"IMHO, I think dYdX doesn't have enough motivation to fully exclude those reward hunters.

You see, these reward hunters need to pay USDC as the fee, and get paid with DYDX as the reward. The thing is DYDX is minted by dYdX almost without cost from now on (the cost was on initiating the project which has been paid).

So reward hunters are actually helping dYdX to turn those minted DYDX (created, virtual, probably will be a no value (?) coin) into USDC (almost equal to solid money).

If you were dYdX, you are likely to do the same thing (allowing those reward hunters to stay in the game), because you will lose a big amount of income (USDC) without those reward hunters."
['Trading%20Reward%20System%20-%20Improvement%20Discussion'],"If you have it on a daily basis, rather than monthly, you are just going to have the extra volume, every day of the Epoch, instead of the last two days. Yes volume will be more consistent, so that would likely work if that's what you are going for. Or perhaps it will just be high in the last hour of each daily epoch."
['Trading%20Reward%20System%20-%20Improvement%20Discussion'],"I think it's easy to spot traders who farm the tokens. The foundation should filter them out on a best effort basis. If you fail to do this the rewards for traders will converge to their trading fees paid and sum to zero.

Explanation...

The main cost of wash trading lies in trading fees paid. The gain of wash trading lies in airdropped tokens which is practically unbound but proportional to their trading volume. This means there is always money to be made from more volume until the airdrop rewards only cover the fees for everyone.

We don't want parasites to dump the tokens on the market to cover their costs and we don't want them to gain power in the protocols governance either.

To keep bad actors in check it might be enough to retroactively inspect the rewards for each one and exclude suspicious accounts as that puts the bot operators at risk of not making their investment back. Even if you don't catch all of them you will tame the whole bunch since everyone of them has to act less aggressively to stay under the radar.

In conclusion...

Every extra profit made by ""buying"" airdrop tokens using trading fees would likely be taken by the wash trading bot operators. As long as the bot operators spreadsheets tells that they make some extra money by producing some more trading volume, logic dictates that they will take that extra money. Adding uncertainty would make those spreadsheets more complicated or at least the risk would have to be priced in which means more rewards for honest traders.

On the other hand, if there are daily snapshots we will still see a lot of ""wash"" trading and the bot operators will be incentivized to find ways to optimize their rewards in ways that take those incentives away from honest traders. This is because the honest traders optimize for the implementation of their trading strategy instead of maximizing airdrop rewards. In terms of airdrop rewards this puts them naturally at a disadvantage compared to market participants that optimize for airdrop rewards specifically."

['Trading%20Reward%20System%20-%20Improvement%20Discussion'],"@0x108 It looks like you don't understand the formula very well. In order to make it profitable for you to spend a lot of fees you need to have a high open interest the whole epoch. So the lock of the capital does matter. You can hedge your rewards, but keeping your short 24+ days is much worse than 7 days. You will have a higher risk of the liquidation and the opportunity cost. Instead of holding a short, you can use this capital all this time for trading and holding OI. I generally agree that is a good improvement and it encourages long term holders. But I think 30-90 days lock or slow unlock are better options."

['Trading%20Reward%20System%20-%20Improvement%20Discussion'],"Greetings all !

Here is my proposal to mitigate abuse which caused (intentionally or not) a DDOS on the DYDX platform, negatively affecting all users and also going against the ToS.

Tweaking the reward structure may or may not help the situation, as debated above, due to the fact that people will always try to game the system. Which, in its self, is not wrong. However, having said that, it is clear that aggressive abuse actions negatively impact the users and must be mitigated.

DYDX administration will not help in this issue because they created the incentives that have users spend a maximum amount of trading fees, and those 100% go in their pockets.

I therefore propose this simple yet highly effective mitigation solution :

-Extend lockup period (after end of epoch) for dydx reward tokens from the current 8 days to 24 days.

Negative effects on users : None, really. Waiting an extra 16 days will not impact your trading or positions.

Positive effects on users : Massive ! Currently the situation is that people have an incentive to spend as many fees as possible in the last day or minutes of the epoch. The idea is to maximize your score, while reducing all opponents relative score (thus the DDOS, either everyone sent many orders, or a malicious actor made the platform unavailable, so opponents could not increase their score).

By extending the lockup period, it is now impossible for malicious actors to spend all their capital in the last day on fees. Currently open interest in the platform is low, but it will increase again when the 8 day period is over (they will sell their dydx tokens and set up neutral high OI positions again. Wait until the last minute, and the problem will 100% re-occur). If they have to wait 24 days to recover their capital (and more), then they will only have 5 days to accrue Open interest, and 1 day to accrue trading fees. Thus massively diluting their efforts. Since the expected reward of these actions will be much lower, there should be less disruption on the last day.

I propose we move to the next step for voting with the proposal:

-Extend lockup period for dydx reward tokens from the current 8 days to 24 days.

edit: 0x108 asks why about the capital. The answer is because they spend all their capital on fees ! KuBu explains it well. We will most likely see a surge in OI right after the 8 day period lockup is over. I would vote to extend it, this is good for all traders, all users, especially all holders. Only people it hurts are those that DDOS'ed the platform, again."
['Trading%20Reward%20System%20-%20Improvement%20Discussion'],By begging to change Epoch 1 to daily distribution after the team has officially stated their position looks strange to me. There are 5 years more to come. Minimum 60 more Epoch. Adjust and learn
['Trading%20Reward%20System%20-%20Improvement%20Discussion'],"I don't think It's a good idea to change the conditions for the epoch1 after the end of the epoch. As you said @0x108 , conditions should be predictable and changes in the conditions after the epoch do not fit this. I agree that the idea of the daily rewards is a good improvement and will have a positive impact on the protocol volume, but I believe that we should make these changes from the 3rd epoch because the second one has already started.

Also, I don't think that volume spike is a big problem long-term. Over time more traders will come and the system will become more efficient anyway and after a few epochs market buy-sell will not be a profitable strategy, but now these traders are doing most of the volume, they are drawing attention to the protocol at the very beginning of the development and deserve their rewards as early supporters. The current system encourages any traders"
['Trading%20Reward%20System%20-%20Improvement%20Discussion'],"People will always find ways to game the system. But as a trader, you want your rewards to be predictible at least. I don't think anything random should be incorporated here about the fees. People will still market buy / market sell until it's no longer profitable but that's totally fine I guess.

Daily rewards calculation won't have cause massive influx of TXs like yesterday.

Well for OI it makes sense but it's at the minute level, you can't really do that on fees or rewards I would say"
['Trading%20Reward%20System%20-%20Improvement%20Discussion'],"oh yeah.

missed the idea with average monthly OI, that indeed makes stuff better to a degree, but it does change a normal trading style more towards boosting fees/ volume on a daily basis..

I still believe a 3-5 days rewards distribution and a random snapshot is better. it will eliminate the last minute over trading and thus limit the potential outage caused by a massive influx of TXs..

I believe we already have a random mechanics in place when it comes to OI calculation on a minute basis, so it should no be hard to execute.

Thoughts ?"
['Trading%20Reward%20System%20-%20Improvement%20Discussion'],"I think you are wrong here. Writing this from my phone so there might be mistakes.

You get weighted rewards on day 1 and day 5 yes. What you fail to see is that if you trade on day 1 and 5 on current calculation, your weight is decaying everyday you don’t trade (total score is increasing everyday, but your score doesn’t increase if you don’t trade) which makes it kinda equivalent.

Ok let’s do the calculation together.

Assumptions :

daily fees are 1m usd

average OI is 100m usd

you paid 1% of daily fees = 10k

you have 1% of total OI = 1m

total trader score is incrementing 1m daily for simplicity

Assuming you trade on day 1 and day 5 only and an epoch is 28 days.

Your rewards for the epoch with the current calculation gets you :

r = 20,000^0.7 * 1,000,000^0.3 = 64672.70

Dydx earned = 3,835,616 * r / 30,000,000 = ~ 8,268 dydx

Total : 8,268 dydx earned

Your rewards for the epoch with daily calculation gets you :

136,986.28 dydx distributed daily

for day 1 :

r = 10,000 ^ 0.7 * 1,000,000^0.3 = 39,810.71

dydx earned = 136986.28 * r / 1,000,000 = 5,453 tokens

for day 5 :

Same amount of dydx because we do the calculations daily

Total : 10,906 dydx earned

So unless I made a calculation mistake, which is possible, it doesn’t change the fact that your point is wrong. Day 2, 3 and 4 being 0 are offsetted by a weighted day 1 and 5.

Conclusion : daily calculations + average monthly OI as suggested before would be a good first smoothing"
['Trading%20Reward%20System%20-%20Improvement%20Discussion'],Reply from @0x108 seems to be valid in the above case and it need serious discussion before epoch 2. The volume spike and drop seems to be stemming out of this ( source )

['Trading%20Reward%20System%20-%20Improvement%20Discussion'],"Random snapshot is not a solution. As a regular and honest trader you want things to be predictable . You don't want to be trading and get no rewards because the random snapshot is out of your time window. .

I don't see how daily rewards negatively impact swing traders, let's say you trade twice a month and get 0.1% of the rewards on the two days you traded. If we consider volume uniform throughout the 28 days then you won't be getting less rewards on a daily calculation than on a monthly calculation ( unless those 2 days you traded were high volume days / outliers) . Of course it needs simulations to be sure but it doesn't seem this way at all.

My opinion : go for daily calculations now for epoch 1 as this will smooth out rewards for honest traders that traded the whole month and negatively impact the ones that traded only the last 4-5 days (chasing rewards). Then during epoch 2 we can refine this as much as needed or earlier if there is a good suggestion coming up. At least it will avoid the volume spikes and make it look more organic."
['Trading%20Reward%20System%20-%20Improvement%20Discussion'],"I think the random snapshot idea is very good. As for daily rewards affecting swing traders, I see your point, In the simplest form they pay the fees on the day they open, maintain OI throughout, and pay fees on the day they close. If that spans over 3 days, they get no rewards for the 2nd day. Perhaps Seven 4 day windows where snapshot is taken randomly any time within the last 4 hours of each window.

Just throwing it out there for comment."
['Trading%20Reward%20System%20-%20Improvement%20Discussion'],"The bulk of the strategy seems to be:

Gather OI the entire month

At the end maximize fees spent and volume.

I believe this needs to be simulated and tested since I think that doing it on a daily basis will make things significantly worse.

A normal swing trader might open a position and not close it for days, during which he makes close to zero trading rewards since his fees are limited, and volume capped.

An ""abuser"" on the other hand , will only farm volume and fees making him get an overwhelming majority of rewards at the end of the day.

In the current system (during the span of a month) an abuser as defined above has limited reach, but a swing trader can towards the end maximize his rewards because of his OI, with some extra fees/ volumes boost.

Now, does this have to happen towards the end of the month? well, no..

One can just as easily boost fees and volume at the beginning of the epoch and add OI the whole month..

Conclusion:

Daily rewards will significantly decrees the incentive to trade normally, and will outcast the swing traders, providing an awful experience.

Possible solution.

Divide the epoch rewards as discussed, but not on a daily basis.. Lets say we divide them into 5-10 allocations that occur with a RANDOM snapshot , and it is by no means announced or displayed immediately. Could be done with a 1 snapshot delay or constantly as an approximation...

The benefits here is that an abuser can not only boost up volume and fees since he will not have the necessary OI to compete ... He needs to do them both, and spread it out in different timeframes since he doesn't know when first snapshot allocation will be.... (this is why you dont announce the allocation amount or inform people about the snapshot. If they know the fist allocation batch is done, they begin boosing fees, volume immediately for the next batch )

Either way, announcing it is still not bad since this actually kinda achieves the desired outcome..

Volume will not peek towards the end on the month but rather it will be spread out evenly with a few peeks in the 5-10 batches

because there are not daily allocations, swing traders and normal people will also benefit and dont have to resort to changing their trading style.."

""Calculate trading rewards on a daily basis to prevent the hockey stick volume profile we are currently seeing. But retain the monthly epoch style payout and 7 day investigation period.""

I think this is an excellent idea. It should smooth out the spikes in volume we see towards the end of the epoch and make rewards a lot more predictable.

""Omit market makers from receiving trading rewards on top of their market making rewards.""

This is not a good idea. Taker volume is taker volume, and some firms that participate in the market making rewards also run taker strategies which drive legitimate volume. They should be separately incentivized to provide liquidity and do organic taker volume - and are not double dipping""

['Trading%20Reward%20System%20-%20Improvement%20Discussion'],"Well, I believe market makers deserve their rewards anyways, maybe they should have a multiplier to decrease it.

Biggest issue is about ""market buy / market sell / repeat"", which in my opinion is hard to track and flag if done properly.

Daily rewards calculation would negate the effect for this epoch and a better solution can be thought during the next 28+ days"

['Trading%20Reward%20System%20-%20Improvement%20Discussion'],"I don't believe market maker should be omitted from receiving rewards. Anyways they contribute mostly on the maker side and generate little fees.

The issue here is the blatant farming of tokens last few days :

Place market buy order for n BTC (or ETH) then place market sell order for n BTC (or ETH), keep repeating. This will generate fees at basically no cost, because the spread on BTC-USD book for n small enough is hovering between 1-2 USD (0.0023% - 0.0046% loss)

By having enough OI, you generate tokens worth 3 to 4 times your ""loss + fees"" this way.

This can easily be seen by looking at the recent trades for a few seconds, blatant.

What should be done against this ? It is quite hard for dydx to catch anyone doing this with multiple accounts, so the rewarding system itself needs a change.

Daily rewards calculation for this epoch would at least negate all the wash trading (but not wash according to DYDX definition) until we can find a better solution for epoch 2. Most ""wash but not wash"" was done last few days so that would reward real users"

I do agree with the first point that trading rewards should be calculated on a daily basis. Currently there is 3,835,616 tokens per Epoch (28 days). Per day this works out to be 136,986 tokens. However, the downside to this is that traders can still game the rewards by targeting specific days. After all 136,986 rewards per day is still a large amount.

That is a little misleading. Here is the dYdX Improvement Proposal (DIP) process works. Key takeaways:

Anyone can make an off-chain dYdX Request for Comments (DRC)

Once an off-chain DRC has a rough consensus, a community member holding more than 10,000 DYDX can create an off-chain vote for the DRC on Snapshot .

Assuming the off-chain DRC passes, the on-chain DIP can then be created by a community member that holds 0.5% - 2.0% of the delegated proposal power (minimum amount depends on executor).

After a delay a vote opens for a set period of time and a quorum is achieved with 0.5% to 10.0% of the total DYDX supply (depending on Executor)

So, users are going about the proper channels by first posting DRCs here in this forum (off-chain). This happens several steps before any governance actions are taken on-chain."

I completely agree with this point. A core tenet of Ethereum and DeFi has been that past users should have a voice in the direction of community owned protocols. Users literally put their money on the line in helping projects reach their potential. I understand why users excluded from the airdrop currently feel disenfranchised. I haven't heard a compelling argument against fixing this besides the fear that some for others might be bad for current recipients. I'm not suggesting we change anyone's existing ownership % of the protocol, just allocate the appropriate amount from the existing ~42.5% of community owned tokens that have yet to be distributed.

I appreciate the response.

I do not think people will decide whether to use a protocol or not in the future based on a (missed) past airdrop.

Unfortunately I do think it will influence future behavior - if you had been a long term user of a project and were then excluded from your stake in the project, would you want to use the project in the future? There is an element of trust that's broken there. For a ""trustless"" industry, we ultimately rely on the goodwill of teams and communities. One day you're the future of france, the next you're writing an incident report. It's faith in the team and community that keeps users through the highs and lows.

I've been involved with a number of other projects and there is something magical about having an engaged community of developers, designers and thinkers. A lot of that engagement flows from positive energy and vibes around a project - everyone's time and attention is limited. If you feel burned by this airdrop, I can almost guarantee you're going to find other projects and communities to focus on.

They will gravitate to deep, liquid books, intuitive UXs, and meaningful trading pairs.

I understand your argument if DYDX had a monopoly on deep liquidity, a good UX and trading pairs. Unfortunately I think competition is only going to heat up dramatically - Synthetix has yet to launch perps, Futureswap is launching soon, plays are being made to open access to regulated centralized perps in restricted countries.

The fact is the laws in these restricted countries excluded a large number of people should only reinforce (and catalyze) a long-term sustainable move into these DeFi systems.

I agree that this could reinforce a move to DeFi long term - but do we want DYDX to be the beneficiary of that shift or another protocol?

['Reduce%20Market%20Maker%20incentives'],"Hey guys, I’m Mike from Folkvang and I’d like to share my thoughts as well. For clarity: we are currently not live on DYDX currently but are integrating our systems right now. We are a decent sized trading shop trading billions of crypto a day globally.

Growing a new exchange is hard, convincing traders and market makers to post liquidity (which has cost of capital and risk) is hard if there is little flow to support that. So rebate incentivization is used to bootstrap some liquidity. In a nutshell we:

Are in favour of lowering the threshold to 0.1% for market makers qualified for the liquidity rebate

Are in favour of slowly (over time) lowering the liquidity reward to 0 tokens (can shift this score into points that help climb maker fee tiers)

Currently DYDX has 2 rebate programs designed to incentivize traders to come and play:

Trade rebate: everyone who paid trading fees gets some, a total of 3.8m (~76%) tokens per epoch. It requires OI (position size) and trading fees paid (mainly taker volume)

Liquidity rebate: market makers that trade >5% of the total volume get access to 1.1m (~24%) tokens per epoch, based on how much liquidity they post in the book “most of the time”*.

Incentivization via rebates is not black and white and it comes in all sizes and shapes on all different kinds of trading platforms. The way we see it is that an exchange should take great care to structure incentivization so that it encourages real wanted behaviour that actually improves things. Otherwise people will game the incentivization programs which is a scary path to go down (example down below). We think the DYDX incentives are great, but they can be slightly improved further to stop gaming even more, these are things we think are wise to pursue:

At all times (for everyone, in all scenarios) fees need to be bigger than rebates: if people can make money by purely trading (especially in less restricted/monitored defi) they will trade for the sake of getting rebates. This has gone wrong many times before, a famous example is fcoin.

We would be in favour of removing the OI metric from the trade rebate calculation. For a professional quant shop it’s very easy to boost this metric with limited risk/costs to boost rebate.

Giving market makers money for providing liquidity they fully control and will pull when vol hits is bad:

Market makers will pull most of this liquidity. Having really fat order books that completely disappear whenever the price moves might do more harm than good. A 99% uptime means an MM can pick 14 minutes a day to not quote anything (most crashes are quicker).

All major exchanges with similar liquidity programs never pay any money for market makers with a high score, instead they help with maker fees which are only as good as the volume you actually do.

Requiring firms to first do 5% of volume just means the biggest shops are in the opportunity to abuse this (hint they are very generally very good at these kinds of games) . See my tweet discussion with @EvgenyGaevoy .

Compare this to an AMM farm like Uniswap: people get paid to post liquidity (yield farming) BUT they cannot pull their orders when this becomes inconvenient: You take the reward and you take the risk.

If you really need to pay market makers with real money to take the other side in situations like high vol / liquidations, our quickly thought out proposal is inspired by AMM yield farming:

Market makers (all of them, no 5% gatekeeping ) can join a BLP like pool that takes on certain trades (liquidations, and big trades on low liq scenario). They just get pushed positions whenever it takes on trades (pro rata), trade price can be calculated in real time based on order book state or index. They get rewards pro rata as well. We would apply some more restrictions like whitelisted MMs not being able to use money from the lending for this (everyone has to put in hard cash)."
['Reduce%20Market%20Maker%20incentives'],"There are too many rewards for market makers. At this stage, market makers have no incentive to hold or stake token. Rewarding market makers is equivalent to continuously providing market makers with cannonballs, which puts the market under pressure."
['Reduce%20Market%20Maker%20incentives'],"Prohibiting double dipping would significantly increase the rewards for regular sized platform users. We can already see that the number of weelky active users is down from launch and still falling. This should be the biggest focus to bring in users to the platform. What is the platform with a falling userbase? Large accounts who are already earning market maker rewards can very easily suck up the majority of the trading rewards. This directly takes away from the utility of attracting new users to the platform.

I'm all for freedom of markets, and if large accounts want to trade on dydx that's fantastic! But Market makers are already receiving a lucrative reward for their risk that they take. If they are also using their large account size to farm trading rewards as a 'user' seems like a complete detraction from the purpose of the trading rewards (Which is to attract new users over time).

I'm happy to keep the market maker rewards as they are since I appreciate any bit of liquidity we can get. But do not like the market makers with their significant account sizes collecting the majority of trading rewards which were as I understand it, intended to attract new users."

['Reduce%20Market%20Maker%20incentives'],"Given the potentially significant impacts that this proposal would have on dydx, we at Gauntlet wanted to provide our perspective on this proposal. We'll go through the two proposals and points made by Zhusu one by one and give our thoughts on the points made by Kronos Research and Wintermute.

In summary, we strongly advocate for thoughtful management of incentive spend. However, we do not support reducing incentives from 1,150,685 to 1,000,000 per epoch and instead support a standardized, predictable, and empirical approach for changing incentives. We support this proposal in spirit to reduce the market maker threshold but would prefer using a tiered system for the reasons outlined below.

""Reduce Market Maker incentives from 1,150,685 to 1,000,000 per epoch""

We strongly support greater thought given to where and how incentives are spent throughout the dYdX protocol. Parameterizing incentive spending more efficiently is important to maximize the utility of the spending and encourage growth and stability within the protocol.

@zhusu point that incentives, in general, should be used to bootstrap liquidity until natural flow can sufficiently compensate market makers is entirely valid and one that we echo. Over time, incentives should be decreased as natural flow replaces the need. However, this should be a well-thought-out process that follows an empirical model that looks at the market conditions and the impact incentives have. For this reason, we ultimately agree with the points from both Kronos and Wintermute that there has not been sufficient analysis or explanation justifying the magnitude of this change.

Arbitrarily changing incentives can ultimately have dangerous outcomes. For example, suppose market makers are not confident in the long-term economic feasibility of doing integrating. In that case, they may be less likely to build out and improve infrastructure or begin to explore alternative trading venues. Therefore, ensuring that changes in incentives are predictable ahead of time and well-analyzed should be paramount when considering a proposal like this.

For now, Gauntlet would oppose this proposal to reduce market maker incentives, barring developing a more standardized, empirical model for doing so. One-off changes like the one proposed can lead to unintended consequences and should be avoided.

""Reduce the threshold for receiving market maker tokens from 5% to 0.5%""

In general, we support this proposal. The fear that reducing the threshold can be ""gamed"" seems highly overblown. As Sam pointed out, there is no way to game the formula by creating additional accounts. Wintermute's point that they should be compensated for investing in their infrastructure, resulting in their strong uptime, is wholly valid. Still, they fail to explain why the current incentive formula doesn't adequately compensate them for that infrastructure, given that it already preferentially rewards based on uptime. We would suggest re-examining the formula for how incentives are paid to ensure Wintermute's concerns are met, however on its face there does not seem like there would be substantial harm from reducing market maker thresholds.

The value of these types of thresholds is that they may cause market makers to provide liquidity during unprofitable times to meet this threshold. However, the lack of a tiered structure like what exists on most centralized exchanges and the amount the current market makers exceed the 5% threshold make this point moot.

In general, reducing the barrier to entry for a market maker in dYdX does have upsides. As mentioned by Zhusu, we'd expect this change to improve liquidity as smaller firms can participate more generally. Reducing the cutoff would allow smaller market makers to set up their infrastructure and reduce the overall cost of liquidity. In addition, distributing tokens to a broader base should help decentralize the protocol, which is another desirable goal to gain additional longer-term buy-in to the dYdX protocol.

As Kronos mentioned, during volatile periods, only a minority of market makers continue providing liquidity. Therefore, making it easier for new entrants should foster competition and prevent fragile centralization in these markets. Alternatively, suppose these new entrants fail to be up to the task of providing good liquidity and high uptime. In that case, the large market makers will continue to earn the lion's share of the incentives, resulting in no worse outcome than the status quo.

Barring an overall reduction in the threshold, we support using a tiered system like that used by FTX, where % of incentive increases at higher milestones. Tiered formulas of this type more closely match centralized exchanges and benefit from incentivizing market makers to trade even when not economically profitable, ensuring liquidity is always present."
['Reduce%20Market%20Maker%20incentives'],"Hey everyone! Josu from Sixtant here.

We've been making every market since dydx launched their L2 back in April, gathering metrics, and looking at how the market structure has been improving. When Epoch 0 launched the volume increased, and so did liquidity, but really, the largest shift came after the token started trading. Competition among market makers increased, with the result of much tighter bid-ask spreads, and much deeper books. In that regard, I think that the liquidity rewards are achieving their goal.

Lowering the threshold makes sense, it seems like the current Epoch will close with around 30B of traded volume, and the next will probably be closer to 50B. So even a 2% threshold will still require market makers to capture around 1B of volume, which requires a well set up operation.

Regarding the Liquidity Rewards, one way to look at them is to look at them as maker rebates. It seems that for the current Epoch the value of the liquidity rewards / maker volume will be around 6bps.

(image)

If we lower the MM threshold (captured share 90%), increase the volume to 100B per epoch, and hold the price of the token constant, the rewards drop to 1.7bps.

(image)

A 1.7bps maker rebate sounds like something reasonable, especially taking into account the uncertainty around the price of the token."
['Reduce%20Market%20Maker%20incentives'],"As for FTX for example - 2.5% gets you way better rate limits and it is not that easy to get to 2.5% on ftx (you'd have to believe me on this:)) There are dozens of ""market makers"" on all major exchanges, but its a completely separate question whether you want/need to incentivize them all to join dydx. I firmly believe we should focus on attracting top10 MMs, maybe top20 and 2.5% is adequate for that"

['Reduce%20Market%20Maker%20incentives'],"Arguments Against:

The 5% threshold isn’t an arbitrary number. Large exchanges like Huobi also require a weighted maker volume ranking in the top 5% to get market making benefits. Additionally, FTX requires 2.5% of all exchange volume, not just maker orders, for the best benefits.

--Huobi ranking the top 5% for the best maker fee(-0.0065 %), top 25% also get good fee (-0.005 %). Huobi also take different trading pairs with different weight, the less liquidity pairs have a higher weight. Huobi now have more than 100 market makers.

For FTX also 2.5% volume get the best maker fee (-0.005%), 0.5% volume get a good fee (-0.005%). Top 0.15% can join the MM program. FTX have more than 100 market maker.

For DYDX is 5% for the best, others have no benefit that is not good. DYDX only need 5 market maker? I doubt it.

0.5% threshold is way too low and has a very obvious downside in that it can be gamed by a market maker creating 3-4 accounts.

---- There is no benefit to separate account. The score is calculated as a sum of liquid times (uptime ratio)**5 . There is no benefit to separate account. If some one separate accounts, each account have a lower uptime ratio, it is no benefit for the Qfinal score.

['Reduce%20Market%20Maker%20incentives'],"Thanks everyone for a very solid discussion! Let me take a stab at summarizing where we are.

The debate so far has centered on the following questions:

Should Liquidity Provider Rewards be reduced? Should rewards be reduced from 1,150,685 to 1,000,000 DYDX per epoch? If not, by how much?

Should the maker volume threshold to participate in the Liquidity Provider Reward pool be reduced? Should rewards be reduced from 5% to 0.5%? If not, by how much?

Let's break down some of the major arguments for each:

A/ Should Liquidity Provider Rewards be reduced? Should rewards be reduced from 1,150,685 to 1,000,000 DYDX per epoch? If not, by how much?

Arguments For:

At the current price of $10.25 per DYDX, LP Rewards represent $421,200 per day (split among 5 market makers). While it is important to bootstrap liquidity in the early days, this number can be decremented over time as the protocol grows.

The natural flow is good enough such that market makers (who have 0 maker fees) can profit without any additional incentives.

Market makers benefit from various incentives and opportunities to earn DYDX. The market makers receiving these Liquidity Provider Rewards are also earning rewards via the Trading Rewards. Wintermute, for example, was the 2nd largest trade farmer during epoch 0, receiving 4.868% of the ~3.83MM token allocation. This double-dipping is quite favorable already.

Whitelisted market makers already have 0 maker fees, and some are already private round investors. This gives them very little incentive to hold/stake the tokens they farm for obtaining fee discounts or to be used in the governance process.

Arguments Against:

The ""double dipping concern"" is overstated. Other rewards such as Trading Rewards are much bigger already. Further, Trading Rewards and Liquidity Provider Rewards focus on two different KPIs – volume and uptime.

High rewards are essential to incentivize market makers to continue taking risks while providing liquidity (high uptime) during periods of high market stress.

High upfront rewards are required to lure market makers into the honeypot with a properly done integration so that they stick around if rewards decrease/disappear.

Any proposal focused on changing rewards should focus on excluding double-dipping and wash trading, rather than discouraging valuable and high-uptime market-making activity.

B/ Should the maker volume threshold to participate in the Liquidity Provider Reward pool be reduced? Should rewards be reduced from 5% to 0.5%? If not, by how much?

Arguments For:

Reduce barrier of entry for smaller market makers to be able to compete: There is no need to gatekeep at 5% and it is worse for liquidity to not allow more small and medium-sized market makers to compete with the larger ones. Reducing this threshold will provide better competition for tight quoting and uptime (especially on alt pairs, which have had quite wide spreads) and should result in better liquidity overall across DYDX Protocol.

Arguments Against:

The 5% threshold isn’t an arbitrary number. Large exchanges like Huobi also require a weighted maker volume ranking in the top 5% to get market making benefits. Additionally, FTX requires 2.5% of all exchange volume, not just maker orders, for the best benefits.

There seems to be community consensus around the following:

Reducing the threshold for receiving market maker tokens reduced from 5% of maker volume to ~2.5% after the end of epoch 2 or 3. This threshold can and should be validated via a community-generated Snapshot.

Wait a few more epochs before making significant changes to the LP Rewards.

The discussion also addressed the following questions:

What % of total rewards should go to Market Makers for long term success?

How should the Liquidity Provider Rewards, Trading Rewards, and Liquidity Staking Pool dynamics improve liquidity, growth, and a better trading ecosystem for all dYdX users?

In the future, the community should continue to discuss the following:

Set the rewards and threshold per market, allowing more niche market makers to focus on specific perps that most market makers won't touch for whatever reasons

Cap rewards per market maker

Introduce vesting on market maker rewards

Gradually reduce market makers rewards over time

The Liquidity Provider reward calculation does not directly take ‘volume’ into account. It only measures quoting depth and uptime. Having less emphasis on ‘real volume’ will very likely lead to wider markets. Having a threshold to monitor ‘real volume’ will improve the tradability of quotes.

['Reduce%20Market%20Maker%20incentives'],Vesting look a good idea but can we ommit the trading rewards from being used in governance. MM are/will be getting millions of token per epoch and I believe over a long period of time this could create a significant imbalance
['Reduce%20Market%20Maker%20incentives'],"Hi guys,

Nibbio's team here.

Appreciate Su Zhu's suggestion and totally see where it's coming from, especially from a token value perspective.

However, I just wanted to give this group a bit of insight into the thinking process from the new joiners' perspective (I obv know that 3AC, Wintermute, and Kronos know the below but the general public might discover it's not that easy to be MM..).

Adding a venue is not an innocuous event. After the traditional assessment of liquidity, depth, latency, ... you then have to allocate capital and manpower to develop your connector, test your algos, fix bugs, and allocate resources for maintenance.

Then sometimes you succeed and make money - yep that happens - and sometimes you're losing some - that happens as well.

Hence, all of the above is taken into account to determine whether an exchange is worth it or not. All the above, but also the potential incentives we can earn from trading on a venue and bringing liquidity to it. Bounty, rewards, bonus, all of that is weighing in, in starting trading on an exchange, OBVIOUSLY. And our decision to start trading on dYdX was (also) driven by the potential Market Makers incentives we could earn.

As a consequence, we think that reducing incentives, at this stage, without a clear anticipated timeline to reduce, would damage the potential incoming competition (and liquidity) to the exchange.

We would then suggest to:

1/ Increase competition and liquidity by reducing the dedicated MM volume requirement from 5% to 2% ;

2/ Provide a clear timeline for reducing incentives (vested or not - we don't really care and anyways perpetual swaps are your friends if you'd like to hedge at a certain price...);

and more from a user perspective

3/ Allow MMs to have subaccounts (under the same eth address, or if not possible other main accounts) that share the preferential maker rebates on the main account (along with all the other benefits that the main account has).

MMs should not be penalized for separating their strategies into multiple sub-strategies, it's just a matter of better risk management;

4/ We have not encountered issues with current rate limits yet, but we would prefer that each sub-account had its own rate limits, not shared among them.

Anyways, thank you for your contribution, and see you all on dYdX."

['Reduce%20Market%20Maker%20incentives'],"** Personal thoughts **

Great ideas and discussion so far, thanks all.

I strongly support lowering the threshold for participation in the program down from 5% - and think this is the first thing the community should focus on. As has been mentioned, this would allow for broader participation in the program, better competition, and therefore better liquidity for end users. Anywhere from 0.5-2% (with a personal preference for lower) would make sense to me.

I personally do not think it makes sense to reduce the amount of rewards to the program right now, though it could be something to consider in the future. As long as the rewards are incentivizing correct and valuable behavior - and they definitely seem to be as the incentivize the things traders care about in spread, depth, and uptime - they are worth keeping on aggressively as dYdX grows. Liquidity is obviously the most important thing to an exchange, and dYdX's liquidity is not yet on par with top centralized exchanges. I think dYdX has the opportunity with this liquidity mining to build some of the most liquid books for any perps with this program, and it's worth remaining aggressive about the rewards to realize that."
['Reduce%20Market%20Maker%20incentives'],"I strongly suggest to lowering the threshold for MM from 5% to 1 %.

Currently 5% is much too high, now only 5 MM can get in, that is not good for small market maker. I think there should be at least 20 market maker. From DYDX's perspective, the more market maker the better. Current setup cannot attract small market makers.

Normally market maker trade a lot of maker order. According to Fee Structure, people trade more than 200,000,000 will get 0 maker fee. Most of MM can easily do it. This means MM pay very few fees. As the trading rewards are based on the trading fees. It means MM get little trading reward, even though they trade a lot.

If they cannot share the Liquidity Provider Rewards. It will be a situation that they provide liquidity, trade a lot, and get less than normal trader. This is not fair.

So for a fair market, it is very important to get more market maker get Liquidity Provider Rewards."

That being said, long-term alignment of MMs and the protocol is key. There appears to be consensus around lowering the threshold for MM from 5% to 2.5% so that would be a logical first step. This would increase inter-MM competition and ensure strong liquidity acquisition value per cost spent. Subsequent steps could then be:

1) introduce vesting on MM rewards

2) gradual reduction of MM rewards over time"
['Reduce%20Market%20Maker%20incentives'],"Hi all, Evgeny here from Wintermute. I’d like to weigh in on the topic as it looks like half of the posts on the forum are from people missing out on the rewards for different reasons.

My position in short – I generally sympathize with anyone missing on rewards and would like to find a solution that would give them closure and at the same time be acceptable to the broader community. I strongly believe dydx owes a lot to early adopters and it is unfortunate so many of them were not recognized, even if there was a fault of their own.

First, some numbers. According to epoch0 review ( https://dydx.foundation/blog/en/epoch-0 ) 67% of total rewards have been earned and claimed. This equates to 24,690,803 unclaimed tokens that went back to treasury. The claimed % has been generally high across 6 different tiers with an exception of lowest one (first one) where only 24% of tokens have been earned (representing roughly 1/3 of total unearned tokens). In terms of total number of tokens the unearned portion is less than 2.5% than circulating supply. However when taking the current float into account the picture is quite different. There are roughly 55 mln tokens in circulation after epoch0, meaning over 50% increase, were we to distribute the unearned tokens one way or another. This would undoubtably create a significant selling pressure even if only 10% of these tokens are being sold. Therefore it would be desirable to somehow filter out hodlers from sellers or to limit the overall impact of supply increase.

Reading through the forum there have been multiple solutions proposed:

Expand the claim period by another 28 days allowing anyone who missed out to earn the rewards by using L2 platform. This inevitably suffers from the community not wanting a selling pressure to crash the token price and also doesn’t reward token holders who did the homework and achieved the tasks required to earn the tokens

Do 50/50, 25/75 or any other % split, allocating some tokens to people who missed out and remaining ones to the community members who have been successful in claiming their tokens. This has the same issue in terms of selling pressure (no way of knowing that the people who were successful in earning tokens initially wouldn’t dump them right away) and also has a perception of community trying to receive extra tokens from treasury under the guise of righting a wrong

Taking the above into account and also aiming to close this topic for good so we can all move forward satisfied with the result I propose the following (take any numbers and dates as arbitrary, but judge the framework in general please):

Allow anyone who fulfilled the tasks by did not claim their tokens to claim them. I honestly think this one is the least controversial of all. People make mistakes and it’s a bit of dick move on community part to refuse them to claim tokens (pardon my French)

Allow anyone who missed on doing the tasks to  claim their rewards, but, given they failed at doing the task and to prevent the dumping, do it in delayed manner. For example, we can make them claimable as of 1 st of January 2022 on the condition that they trade in each epoch starting with epoch1. There are 4 epochs left till end of year, so for each epoch they complete the task, they would be receiving ¼ of their unclaimed tokens.

This would achieve multiple goals of increasing overall volume of dydx, while making it more fair to anyone who did the task for the original drop. It would also delay the selling pressure by 3.5 months

I would also propose to potentially exclude the first group (which had over 8 million tokens unclaimed) as it is the group that most likely had people trying to game the system. This would significantly reduce the overall allocated amount as well. Not 100% sure about this one because 300 $DYDX tokens can be a significant sum for many and i'd rather have bunch of opportunists make more money than a lot of less fortunate people miss out on rewards, but its hard to estimate how many of each we have. Maybe somebody can script it and parse through 6K wallets...

Another very important consideration to consider is how much of these calculations will take time from the core dev team. My preference would be to pursue a solution that takes the least time possible.

I’ll conclude by saying that I personally think we should find a way forward and shouldn’t look for precedents from other projects but instead look to create a precedent of our own and be an example to others in how we treat early adopters. Thank you for reading through😊"

['Reduce%20Market%20Maker%20incentives'],"Hi everyone, DAT Trading here to give our thoughts on this topic.

The goal is to make DyDx one of the best crypto exchanges. For DyDx to be great, two things need to happen: Customer's should have as low transaction cost as possible, and token holders should benefit from the growth and profitability of the entire DyDx ecosystem.

We are not a fan of reducing total rewards at this exact moment. But as Evgeny Gaevoy mentioned, “For the mid-term, I’d be more in favor of rewards and thresholds captive to individual markets allowing smaller/niche MMs to focus”. We believe changing the weights as time moves forward will be an important step to make the platform fair, but also as liquid as possible. Without strong belief in a DyDx, a firm will not be an early investor + market maker + power user. We shouldn’t disincentivize “bigger players” to trade as much as possible while the protocol is still growing.

A quick note on how rewards are calculated:

The Liquidity Provider reward calculation does not directly take ‘volume’ into account. It only measures quoting depth and uptime. Having less emphasis on ‘real volume’ will very likely lead to wider markets. Having a threshold to monitor ‘real volume’ will improve the tradability of MM’s quotes. Currently, DyDx’s ETH and BTC books are one of the tightest perp markets mainly due to a well-designed MM incentive program.

We agree with Evgeny Gaevoy’s conclusion and think it’s a good way forward.

We love that the community is so involved so early!

['Reduce%20Market%20Maker%20incentives'],This is already the case.
['Reduce%20Market%20Maker%20incentives'],Thanks for the clarification David
['Reduce%20Market%20Maker%20incentives'],"Hi all, Evgeny here from Wintermute. Exciting to see the governance topics emerging!

A bit of background: we’ve been supporting dydx for two years, starting with spot markets, followed by first version of perps and, finally, the current L2 variant. We quote every single market and are committed to provide liquidity in majority of future launches. We are also investors in the previous two rounds and, contrary to Zhu Su argument, haven’t sold a single token from the rewards as we see much higher upside in the token price for ourselves and would rather have a bigger weight in governance.

There are a number of topics being raised by this discussion and @Ben Yorke did a good job outlining some of the counterarguments, allowing me to be slightly more concise😊

First of all, there is little explanation behind the magnitude of the reduction, i.e. why is it 1,150,685 to 1,000,000 and not to 500,000 or 666,666? My preference would be to have a well thought process behind the numbers and current rewards are set at the level that made it feasible for current market makers to invest significantly into dydx integration and, more importantly, uptime. Kronos did a fantastic job this epoch (and we are dedicating resources internally to catch up😊) which would have been a less obvious course of action were the rewards smaller. Just integrating with dydx is not enough – you need to have quotes that are still there in volatile markets as well and it is an investment that most MMs wont do without a decent risk/reward in mind. We already see more MMs from FTX leaderboard joining (hi Nibbio!) and once they integrate and provide liquidity, they will stick and remain here even if the rewards are phased out in mid/long term all while having a more robust tech supporting it. One solution would be to introduce a cap on how much a MM can earn from the incentives (e.g. X% of the total MM rewards)

I also wanted to comment on “double dipping”. I really don’t understand why one wouldn’t want to incentivize MMs to trade more on platform. Firstly, on the maker side we already use dydx as liquidity source, skewing our quotes towards the bid/offer if we need to close out a risk in a given token, which makes markets more liquid and surely is a preferable state of affairs for the exchange as a whole. It is true that we are also active on the taker side and I actually don’t see what’s the problem is in us taking liquidity (as long as we don’t take it from our own quotes a.k.a. wash trade, which can be easily monitored by dydx). Trade rewards and MM rewards are focusing on two different KPIs – volume and uptime, which cannot be easily merged into one metric. For example you can have 20 MMs quoting 20 bps wide, doing 4% each and one MM quoting 10bps wide with 20% market share and I would argue that the latter totally deserves more rewards, but he wouldn’t be recognized as a good MM by uptime alone (receiving only 1/21 of total rewards, assuming uptime is the same).

0.5% threshold is way too low and has a very obvious downside in that it can be gamed by a market maker creating 3-4 accounts. I think 2.5% makes more sense. It might also make sense to leave it at 5% but set the rewards and threshold per market, allowing more niche MMs to focus on specific perps that most market makers wont touch for whatever reasons (for example Wintermute is not going to MM privacy token perps for regulatory reasons).

I’ll pause here to switch to a more general comment. We are hardly one month away from token launch and governance is very much in its infancy. I hope the arguments presented by me and Ben paint a more complex picture than a bunch of greedy MMs trying to dump the rewards on retail. On top of it, a lot of investors (including ourselves) haven’t exercised the token warrants, meaning any governance vote would be pretty exclusive. This point is important not just to this particular discussion but to any topic that we would be voting on going forward. Wintermute preference would be to postpone any significant votes for at least another month.

For this particular proposal I’d be in favor of:

Keeping the rewards as they are to make sure we get more MMs lured into the honeypot with a properly done integration so that they stick and not evaporate if rewards decrease/disappear. A more thorough discussion can look deeper of how much we would want to pay per market maker or introduce caps on max DYDX token rewards per market maker

Reduce the threshold to 2.5% more in line with comparable cefi thresholds after the end of epoch 2 or 3 once there are more market makers (5% is totally achievable currently for anyone willing to challnge the incumbents). For the mid term, I’d be more in favor of rewards and thresholds captive to individual markets allowing smaller/niche MMs to focus"

- [@zhusu](/dydx/account/0xc5ef1C84EA5C570979DA35eB7C068687d15709ee) 's post refers to the 1,150,685 DYDX available to market makers via the Liquidity Provider Rewards. Any market maker doing maker volume above >=5% of total trading maker volume in a given epoch is currently eligible to join the Liquidity Provider Rewards pool in the following epoch. There are no stakers / borrowers here. This 5% threshold acting as a gatekeeper for more small and medium-sized market makers to compete is the topic of the debate.
- The Liquidity Provider Rewards pool is different from the Liquidity Staking Pool where community-approved liquidity providers can borrow staked USDC. This pool operates as a two-sided, under-collateralized, interest-free liquidity system. In this pool, stakers (not liquidity provider borrowers) receive DYDX rewards. 
With this said, your thoughts on the lower threshold are more applicable to the Liquidity Staking Pool, not the Liquidity Provider Rewards. Per the [docs](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/staking-pools/liquidity-staking-pool), Governance should do diligence on new and existing borrowers in the Liquidity Staking Pool but eligibility for the Liquidity Provider Rewards and the Liquidity Staking Pool are separate and distinct (though some market makers may participate in both).

"
['Reduce%20Market%20Maker%20incentives'],Could we allow MMs to be eligible for rewards at 0.5% but without allowing them to borrow USDC from the protocol? and move the borrowing USDC and other risky benefits to whitelist only?
['Reduce%20Market%20Maker%20incentives'],We should wait and watch 3 or 4 more epochs. DYDX liquidity is not so great when you compare with cex's . I agree with the rewards being very high in dollar terms
['Reduce%20Market%20Maker%20incentives'],"Great discussion, dYdX community

Quick introduction, I'm Ben Yorke representing Kronos Research, one of the five designated market makers on the platform. My other role is the marketing lead of WOO Network, which provides liquidity support for Kronos' market making on dYdX. As a personal note, I’m also a dYdX user, token holder, and ecosystem participant.

Some quick stats: We have the top uptime of all the market makers by a substantial margin (averaged over 98.3% across all pairs), and our market maker score (a function of liquidity within a narrow depth) is also substantially higher than other market makers.

(image)

I have had discussions with both the WOO Network DeFi team and Kronos Research’s DeFi traders about this proposal. We have taken this proposal very seriously as we are committed to helping dYdX achieve long-term success. In order to achieve top uptime and market maker score, we’ve made substantial time and resource investments for trading on the dYdX platform. We spent a long time working with the dYdX team to optimize their integration process, at a time when there were no guarantees about the success of the platform (although we did have a hunch as an early investor in dYdX).

We are also delighted to see Su’s proposal, as it shows an active governance ecosystem is forming with the long-term interest of token holders in mind. Now it’s time to do our part.

Let’s start with the last part of the proposal - the lower threshold:

In the proposal, this threshold is framed as a barrier to entry, which reduces competition. As a trading firm, we welcome competition and recognize it is inevitable. However, what is being suggested is that the dYdX community will allow a much larger group of traders access to unsecured lending.

Where does that come from? User funds being staked on the platform. We view the 5% requirement as a guarantee that the firm borrowing without collateral possesses the competency to use their reputation as collateral and not put stakers’ assets at risk.

What would happen if many small market makers are allowed to borrow stakers’ assets unsecured and a negative event occurs, which causes some of them to be unable to repay? The stakers would bear the losses and the integrity of the platform would suffer as a result.

Unlike the existing market makers, smaller ones may not have the same reputational motivation to act in good faith. For this reason, we view the threshold as a bar for including reputable market makers and protecting stakers, not as a barrier for competition.

(image)

Source: https://dydx.foundation/blog/en/liquidity-staking-pool

A second point is that a lower threshold for competition won’t necessarily result in new market makers outcompeting firms like Kronos for top-of-the-book liquidity.

(image)

Data already shows there is a significant drop off in quality of liquidity between the top three providers versus the fourth and fifth, as visualized by two of the market makers here receiving a much smaller share of the rewards.

Market makers compete for rewards on three objectives: size, bid-ask spread and up-time. If smaller market makers can compete on size and spread, then they will naturally meet the 5% threshold. The most important and difficult aspect is up-time, which requires significant technical and operational investment. During the market wide crash on September 7th, Kronos was the only market maker quoting in several of dYdX markets because of our ability to stay up during volatile market conditions. We believe rewards are essential for incentivizing market makers to continue taking risks while providing liquidity during periods of high market stress - if we didn’t continue taking that risk, then some orderbooks would have been empty throughout the crash.

Lastly, for reference, the 5% threshold isn’t an arbitrary number. Large exchanges like Huobi also require a weighted maker volume ranking in the top 5% to get market making benefits. Additionally, FTX requires 2.5% of all exchange volume, not just maker orders, for the best benefits. We believe 0.5%, as proposed, is uncharacteristically low, especially for a DeFi platform which carries additional risk to market makers relative to CeFi exchanges.

https://help.ftx.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044358751-2020-06-05-VIP-Program-and-Market-Maker-Policy

To summarize, we believe this proposal would result in the protocol lending out users’ assets unsecured without any guarantees that dYdX liquidity will improve. We believe that capable firms should be able to meet the 5% requirement. And we welcome that, because better liquidity will lead to more growth and a better trading ecosystem for all dYdX users. If dYdX holders would like to make a change, then we have two suggestions:

Reducing the threshold to a value around 2.5%

Deferring the proposal until more data from future epochs is acquired, then updating the threshold

We think dYdX is better off to gradually lower the threshold, rather than lower it too aggressively and increase the potential that dYdX stakers experience a significant loss. Note: We’d appreciate hearing from other market-makers, as they have industry experience and have met similar requirements on other exchanges as well.

As for the next part of our response, we’d like to first state that we are open to discussions about reducing rewards but, while recognizing our bias, we don’t believe this is the right time. The reasoning behind this is that while rewards are fixed, volumes on dYdX have a lot of room for growth. Market maker rewards might seem high now, but if volumes grow higher and more market makers become active, then in the long run the fixed rewards will be distributed a lot more fairly.

Providing liquidity on-chain in a volatile market has a lot of risks - if market makers aren’t incentivized, they will simply take fewer risks, resulting in worse liquidity and trading experience for dYdX users. Great liquidity is one of the main reasons dYdX has achieved such a strong position among DeFi derivatives platforms - we believe dYdX should not risk its advantage so soon after launch. While understanding our position has a bias, we feel this seems like a premature policy change that might not pay off in the long-term. We believe the short-term cost of inflationary rewards will be offset by the long-term success dYdX can achieve as the leading DeFi derivatives platform. We think more data from future epochs should be obtained before dYdX passes a proposal that could have a negative impact on its liquidity and user experience.

Regarding double-dipping by also earning taker rewards - we at Kronos Research don’t do that. We are solely focused on the making side. If users can game the system by wash trading for rewards without contributing organic volume, then we believe any proposal focused on changing rewards should focus on excluding double-dipping and wash trading, rather than discouraging valuable and high-uptime market making activity.

Most importantly, we’d like to restate our commitment to the dYdX community. We are eager to discuss and vote with the rest of the community, and we are optimistic about the future of the ecosystem.

Thanks from the WOO Network and Kronos Team.

['Proof of Competence - PoC'],"This is just insulting to those who used L1 and flies in the face of what a caring community is about. I didn't use uniswap for about 3 months but started using it again when the gas fees were realistic. Fortunately, Uniswap did what was fair to their users and rewarded those who help bring it to prominence. DYDX could have done the same. Many L1 users were not notified and missed the ""window"", the fact that nearly 25,000,000 tokens were not claimed by such a large number of L1's shows there was a problem. But to think that you reward users as recent as July 29th 2020 and forget about those who help bring DYDX to where it is today. This proposal is again another slap in the face of participants. And if this is what the community is built on, it is a very shaky foundation."

"['[Updated Proposal]: Missed airdrop, here is a solution...']","I disagree. The people who missed out on the airdrop are the ones that would want to dump. I personally as a early “pioneer” L1 user still had the ability to keep up with the community in regards to the airdrop and was full aware a few months prior to august that the trade had to be made in august to collect rewards. Why should we pity those that were off in La La Land doing whatever they were doing and not paying attention. Also a lot of these people that are complying are mad because they put in a lot of effort into opening a lot of wallets and paying a ton of gas fees. That is what they are made about. Because they could have made x amount of money from opening up a ton a wallets and the gas that they paid. If you invested all that time opening up these wallets you should have invested actual time in the community and you would have been okay claiming your tokens. But instead the few that are making noise are sour because they missed out. I am a long time holder and don’t plan on selling my coins for a long time. I would vote against any proposal to distribute more funds period. I’ve missed out on a few crypto airdrops myself personally but do I cry about it on the daily, no I’ve moved on. Let’s not entertain these folks, the devs are smart and put those rules in place because they already knew people would open up a ton of wallets. So making an extra trade in august was kind of proof that you would be willing to go an extra mile to claim this tokens and spend a little more money to get them. Now that the token is worth $10 and stable it’s the only reason a small minority are complaining about it. Dydx will grow regardless we don’t need a bunch of whiny mooches in our community."
"['[Updated Proposal]: Missed airdrop, here is a solution...']",Everybody should get the airdrop they deserve !! The time conditions were very short!!!

Dev's 28 days reward/punishment airdrop time window idea was very poor, omo.

Airdrop supposed to be a marketing strategy, not pissing users off strategy.

I currently trading over $10M per month volume over binance, I'm sure it wasn't much less back when I used L1 at time when fees were around $20-$200 per contract. I completely stopped about a year ago when fees start going over $600-$2K per. I was sure devs are be working on the issue at some point, so occasionally I was checking back at the bookmarked https://margin.dydx.exchange/margin/ETH-DAI url. Never seen anything saying about new website or airdrop, except thinner books, I even had a thought it was a dead project.

Someone said they were seeing some popup message about new site coming, but then I'm sure dy/dx devs are to smart not to engage popup on window open, because my 3 year old probably knows that most browsers will block event if its not been invoked by direct user action.

And now, out of blue moon I get news about expired short lived airdrop. Not cool.

I'm sure if I never chose to come back to dy/dx it will be very minimal impact for the project, but I also sure there are many people like me out there, who would do same as me based on their principles. and I not talking about daily twitter checkers and monkey task `deposit?.make1trade` completers."

I see a lot of mistrust of the DRC vote for whatever reason, so if the community and foundation responds with their answer, no matter what it is, this issue will end and no more effort will go toward pushing for it or against it. No matter how this forum poll goes, people won't be satisfied until they get an answer through solid token governance.

Just my reasoning."
"['[DRC] Extending the ""28-day"" period post Epoch 0']",Another blant statement. Most of people who missed the airdrop are L1 users which makes them even more OG. I missed my airdrop but continue to use DYDX and got my reward for that. These people deserve appreciation and respect.

As early adopters we have actually been punished compared to newer users."
"['[DRC] Extending the ""28-day"" period post Epoch 0']","I appreciate the time it took you to write this, at least you have shown thoughtfulness into why you don’t agree that early users should be rewarded for their early use and support of the protocol. I am also not surprised by your response because by voting yes to this proposal you would be in direct conflict of your own interests by diluting the value of your holdings.

I do however think the DYDX team will be able to do something which works for everybody and doesn’t forget those of us who are entitled to our share of the protocols success."
"['[DRC] Extending the ""28-day"" period post Epoch 0']","@ICA First and foremost thanks for taking the time to write this. I thought I was alone until I read this and some of the other comments on this thread.

i completely agree with your premise that this should not be left to a community vote at all because it’s overwhelmingly going to be a vote against each time. There’s no way anybody would vote to dilute the value of their holdings.

one thing that is important to note which I’ve seen someone above say is that Layer 1 users also could not have known about token or rewards because there aren’t even any prompts on the Layer 1 interface like there is on Layer 2. On Layer 1 there is no mention of rewards but there is on Layer 2.

For me, a time-lock may be a good option…

Example;

Retroactive users are entitled to an extension of time however the tokens they claim aren’t redeemed to their wallets until a minimum 6month cool off period but claimants have option to extend this by a longer period for additional rewards. I.e if you delay for further 6months you get 15% more etc. I’ve seen other protocols do this successfully.

what’s the best way for us to move forward with things? Have you managed to make any formal contact with DYDX?"
"['[DRC] Extending the ""28-day"" period post Epoch 0']","I appreciate the effort in thinking of alternatives but I don’t think the competing option is the answer. It should be fair and equal. This shouldn’t be left to a community vote because as you say it will be a majority no each time.

I think having a time-lock is a legitimate answer;

Example;

Retroactive users are entitled to an extension of time however the tokens they claim aren’t redeemed to their wallets until a minimum 6month cool off period but claimants have option to extend this by a longer period for additional rewards. I’ve seen other protocols do this successfully."
"['[DRC] Extending the ""28-day"" period post Epoch 0']","I’m not surprised people here would think like you. That’s why I agree with ICA’s initial post, this decision shouldn’t be left to the community, it should be a DYDX team decision as they set the initial claim period. It’s a conflict of interest to expect current holders to agree to a proposal which in effect dilutes the value of their token holdings.

the one compromise which can be made which I wouldn’t mind agreeing to though is allowing early users of Layer 1 additional time to claim but having a time lock on the release of the token claim to wallets for say 6+ months. However giving claimants the option to delay redemption for a longer period for additional rewards I.e if you delay for longer you get additional tokens."
"['[DRC] Extending the ""28-day"" period post Epoch 0']",How do you know this? Where was this info shared?
"['[DRC] Extending the ""28-day"" period post Epoch 0']","But in order for it to be fair and equitable, you would need to provide those who were not able to do the trades within the window an opportunity to claim their tokens or the ""vote"" you propose is inequitable and not democratic in any way."
"['[DRC] Extending the ""28-day"" period post Epoch 0']",The email verification didn't work when I was in the alpha for L2 so...go figure. It is still not working today.
"['[DRC] Extending the ""28-day"" period post Epoch 0']","No but it was inequitable. As not all users were informed. I only interacted through email, I even have emails from people working at DYDX trading inc. when I joined their Alpha for L2. By not informing everyone on all communication platforms they were leaving people out of the discussion and potential to participate in the community."
"['[DRC] Extending the ""28-day"" period post Epoch 0']","I think the timeframe was ample. But the delivery of the message was done so inequitably because it only allowed for those on twitter, discord but not email to know about the airdrop claim information. I'm not on discord but I get emails from DYDX about new listings. So, why not email me about the airdrop stipulations?"
"['[DRC] Extending the ""28-day"" period post Epoch 0']",People don't care about seeing the price. Even if it was a dollar it would have helped many users have some voting power in the community. Now those are the begging poor of the community. I think it is not a way to treat community members.

Cut out all of the first tier users

Price impact must be minimal. 80% of the non-claimed wallets are in this tier. Also, I bet most of the traders who traded multiple wallets are in this tier.

Give unlimited time to the users that are above those tiers

If you traded more than 1k$ on L1, and haven't been around that much lately, chances are you've been in crypto a long time. Maybe you've also built a following around yourself.

Take for example @defi_dad on Twitter. That guy went from tweeting about dydx with a lot of enthusiasm one year ago, to posting not so optimism predictions anymore. He's got 100k+ crypto twitter followers. We don't want those predictions to become self-fulfilling...

Also on Twitter, I noticed this adheres to the initial motivations from Antonio . In fact I was surprised to see no mention at all about any time limit in the 10+ tweet thread where he announces the retroactive-rewards program.

As a developer, I know the dev team will appreciate implementing one of the simplest solutions amongst the ones that were proposed up to now.

Last but not least, giving unlimited time also reduces price impact and sell pressure as there won't be any rush to get the tokens and sell them. E.g. one of the commenters in another thread about this still has his 400 UNI.

I think with this proposal we have a chance to put this past us, and also make some green DYDX candles along the way. Maybe some candles who wound't have even been there otherwise.

It's funny to see opposer say, we do not follow community, so we do not deserve it. When I had issues back in 2020, I checked out their github, docs, contacted Antonio on Telegram, which was normal chat back then, now announcement only.

Performing those actions - checking team's discord and twitter everyday, brings absolute ZERO values to the protocol before the token launch, or before the governance forms.

I suggest following solution:

Airdrop all unclaimed tokens evenly to everyone that claimed and to everyone that was eligible but missed the airdrop.

+with possible lock period.

This way if airdrop will impact the price, the ones that claimed before will be rewarded which should compensate for possible dump.

The ones that already claimed get the most and the ones that didn't will be partially punished but still rewarder for being part of the project.

Maintenance of your own self interests does not have to turn into a show of psychological projection.

There have been proposals to prevent dumping through incremental release or locked staking, as well as proposals to incentivise prevoius claimers with a percentage of newly released airdrop.

A combination of these to whatever percentage (to be decided) would surely appease all parties and be of best outcome for the sustained growth of the platform.

1/ Releasing more airdrop will double the current supply. This will greatly affect existing DYDX holders. They are very important part of the community. The benefit to one person is the loss to another. How can the team balance this? Even having a vesting plan.

2/People who are complaining that they don't see the airdrop in L1 and they have 28 days to go to the community chat group or this forum to ask questions. Why did not they do it to understand all rules? But after the deadline they are here and ask and blame a lot? When they have a problem that they don't understand without discussing it in the community. And when they do not receive benefits, they come to claim? Do they deserve to be 'early adopters' or 'early supporters'?

3/People complain about 28 days being too short to complete the tasks. I do not think so. 28 days in the crypto world is enough time for a project to go through a lot of achievements, prices also change very quickly. 28 days without news in the crypto world I think I'm old-fashioned."

Users on the, cheaper, L2 smartcontract had the advantage to cheaply sign transactions and fullfill the obligations needed to get the airdrop.

The people at L1 didn't know the project had tried to deploy on L2 and experience the product. They complain again that L1 costs more gas, and can't see the airdrop on L1. In fact, they have left or lost faith in the project before the project deployed on L2."

"['[DRC] Extending the ""28-day"" period post Epoch 0']","Incentives programs and airdrops are not the same thing @Antonio Juliano . Incentives programs drive short-term activity, yes. But airdrops are different.

A well-executed airdrop provides a ton of value to a protocol by rewarding early adopters significantly enough that they will be forever champions of the protocol. This is at the cost that you might inadvertently reward some airdrop hunters, but it has empirically turned out to be worth that cost.

Having a short claim window with occluded announcement of the airdrop is not a good way to achieve the above. You end up disproportionately rewarding airdrop hunters and alienating early adopters who may have missed the claim window, for whatever reason. It's the opposite of what you want.

For these early adopters who miss out, it may have been better to never distribute an airdrop at all. You alienate a significant chunk of your early audience (as has been reported by the percentage of unclaimed rewards) and divide your core community. Half of your earlier adopters leave with feelings of betrayal and become your biggest critics, while the other half focus on division and short-term gain rather than building a brighter protocol.

"['[DRC] Extending the ""28-day"" period post Epoch 0']","Hi all,

Thought I might add my thoughts to the thread. I would like to think they are fairly balanced overall, so I hope they are considered with some weighting in further discussions.

I am approaching this as someone who is not of a technical background but who, despite still working a 9-5 in the legacy world, is still active in various Ethereum DeFi communities and stays somewhat up to date with developments broader ecosystem.

Disclaimer: I am a holder of both a claimed airdrop account AND an unclaimed airdrop account (go figure), so I will be affected by any action or inaction taken.

TL;DR

I am in support of a combination of:

Extending the claim period (I think up to the end of the calendar year but open to something different); and

Reducing the reward amount to between 33% - 50% of the original reward across all tiers.

Logic

Overall, there are a number of competing interests here:

dYdX Dev Team - The additional work required to execute on such a proposal (regardless of how simple or complex the final outcome is) would both add little-to-no value and would take away from work they could otherwise be doing that would add substantially more value.

dYdX Treasury - Foregone airdrop allocation could materially benefit their budget for further expanding the platform through other incentive/growth programs, which arguably adds more value.

$DYDX token holders and claimed airdrop accounts - Broadly, financially incentivised to be more aligned with the Dev Team and Treasury (see first 2 points), as this likely creates more value for the platform and in turn the token price. Additionally, popular view is emerging that unclaimed token accounts (see next point) would likely cause sell-side pressure on the token.

Unclaimed airdrop accounts - Broadly, financially incentivised to lobby for more time regardless of the reasoning behind it (equity, greed or other)

I agree with a number of the points set out by all sides, specifically:

I would prefer the dYdX Team to focus more of their efforts on the most value-adding tasks for the platform

I would prefer the dYdX Treasury to have more financial ammunition to grow the product

I would prefer to see ""number go up""

I would prefer to see early users rewarded for contributing to the platform's early growth, regardless of how much that may be and how active they are in the broader crypto community

That said, I also take a different opinion on a number of points that have arisen from this thread, specifically:

Contrary to the opinion voiced by Antonio, most token airdrop programs to date have in fact been designed reward early adopters of the platform, be it the users of the product or those that provided liquidity to allow the platform to function. Without these users, it may not have been as successful as it has been

A larger Treasury balance may not necessarily mean a better use of the token's supply. I would argue that the UniSwap Treasury is not being used to its full potential. That said, who is to say in either case that a better use of the token's supply is distributing it to users? An argument could be made for either side.

Not every eligible unclaimed airdrop account will be creating sell-side pressure on the token's price and those that do will only be able to do so once, meaning the token's price will only be affected in the short term.

Not every eligible unclaimed airdrop account is one person and, as a result, may not be necessarily benefiting as many early users as one may think. As Evgeny pointed out, a large portion of unclaimed airdrop token supply sits in accounts from the base tier, where the barrier to eligibility is much lower.

Personal opinion:

My views sit somewhere towards the middle.

Overall, I don't think 28 days was ample opportunity, mainly for the fact that not everyone that is an early user is necessarily involved on a daily, weekly or even monthly basis for various reasons. For that reason, I am of the opinion that they should not simply miss out.

That said, I also don't think those that missed the retroactive claim period should receive the full amount of the original reward. Being an early user does not necessarily mean you are a valuable user. There is some recency bias to this argument, but given the price discovery of the token it is very possible that a large portion of the proponents of this vote will not necessarily be the same users that will continue to drive growth of the token.

While this does result in non-value-adding work for the Team, I think it comes as a result of a decision being made that was not optimal. That, to me, is something they should bear."

How many of these self proclaimed early adopters who unfairly missed the airdrop have moved all their trading to dydx to gain tokens? Provide USDC liquidity?

All I see is a bunch of people who weren't following the project, didn't think it was worth it to claim the airdrop and just want to dump it as soon as they receive it.

May I remind you something? This is a Governance Proposal Discussion. Your attempt to ask the affected users 'moving on' from the issue is virtually to dissuade participation in the governance, which should not be encouraged / endorsed by the community. Unfortunately, the dydx team and mod are turning a blind eye to this kind of behaviour.

Asking us, the affected users, to start contributing again, to build the value of your airdrop tokens, doing so before the matter is fairly resolved, is not just unrealistic, but a serious insult to the affected community.

All I see is a bunch of people who weren't following the project, didn't think it was worth it to claim the airdrop and just want to dump it as soon as they receive it.

I believe if there was a commitment to allocating 7.5% of the supply towards early, loyal users, team should try fulfil that commitment to the best of their ability rather than using filters such as short timeframe and limited awareness (and other reasons mentioned at the top) as a mechanism to ensure not all the 7.5% supply is distributed. Plenty of examples out there like Uniswap and 1inch that have managed to do their airdrop in an a more altruistic manner and allow those who have the snapshot eligibility to redeem still till this day.

I do agree that it would be rather excessive to release all 25mil DYDX tokens but want to raise a few points on this:

Evgeny's proposal to exclude the first group would see 8 of the 25mil tokens remain in the treasury.

Its likely that still a decent % of tokens will go unclaimed and remain in the treasury."
"['[DRC] Extending the ""28-day"" period post Epoch 0']","Thankyou Evgeny for taking the time to read through the comments and share your well articulated thoughts.

I really like your proposal, its fair and would serve to drive further volume on the exchange. However, I am concerned this would still be voted against by most as current token holders will not vote to dilute the supply even if it is delayed.

I propose in addition to yours that 10% of the unclaimed tokens be available to claim by those who did manage to claim in epoch0. This would simply serve to counteract potential token depreciation of current holders and give them some incentive to vote yes. Such a small amount should not as you say have a ""perception of community trying to receive extra tokens from treasury under the guise of righting a wrong""

I also think that tokens should be claimable as soon as trading requirements are fulfilled for each epoch. This would mean tokens are released more gradually and randomly rather than waiting for a period of time then releasing them all at once."

Also, I think it's a way better marketing to make a lot of people happy, that are going to spread the news and for sure onboard more people, than to make a lot of people talk trash about the platform.

It's not that huge amount of money and I am very sure that soon enough you will generate this profit for a short amount of time.

ALSO, I think the main mistake was, that this ""claiming period"" was not well explained. I entered the platform like 8478924 times during the claim period I didn't even realize what I had to do, to not miss this period and actually, I waited for gas prices to go lower, as they were HUGE at that time, to move my funds from the margin account to the perpetuals one."

For circulating supply and token dumping, Evgeny's solution proposes wonderful idea to prevent it.

Regarding dev team's efforts , proposal can allocate certain amount of tokens to dev team and certain percentage of token amount can be left at community treasury as a growth fund.

Hi @Antonio Juliano

I believe this short 28-day period can be more justified if all users were properly notified. I made a comparison to the Gitcoin airdrop which also had a short 30-day claim window, and why I think it is more justified by their email notices in this post above.

How did you consider it was *communicated* to L1 users, while 'Rewards' tab and any mentioning of the Airdrop claim process is completely missing from L1 pages? Screenshots in my post .

If the primary goal was to reward users with these tokens , why not to let them claim now as these tokens were not supposed to be to be given to community fund when airdrop was planned .

"['[DRC] Extending the ""28-day"" period post Epoch 0']","** Personal thoughts **

It's first worth mentioning that this proposal could cost the community treasury around 25M DYDX if 100% of unclaimed allocations are made available to earn - a massive amount. Those are funds that could be put towards other growth programs. For context, dYdX Trading Inc.'s yearly growth program budget is in the low single digit $ million range - so this would represent many orders of magnitude more capital that could be more optimally deployed towards growth. Paying tens of thousands of dollars of value to acquire a single user is not a reasonable growth proposition, and is hugely inefficient.

The primary purpose of the Retroactive Rewards was not to reward past users, but rather to drive growth to the protocol and bootstrap governance by making sure early token holders are actual users of the product. Another purpose was to ensure there was a significant enough circulating supply upon the token becoming transferable - and with most allocation having been successfully claimed, that objective has already been completed.

As Evgeny mentioned, keep in mind that anything the dYdX team has to build into the backend to support this will take away dev time from other value generating engineering projects. We're already stretched simply trying to keep the exchange running with the dramatic increase in activity."

"['[DRC] Extending the ""28-day"" period post Epoch 0']",NO. I guess all should be treated fairly...this is a community-base project now.
"['[DRC] Extending the ""28-day"" period post Epoch 0']","Hi all, Evgeny here from Wintermute. I’d like to weigh in on the topic as it looks like half of the posts on the forum are from people missing out on the rewards for different reasons.

My position in short – I generally sympathize with anyone missing on rewards and would like to find a solution that would give them closure and at the same time be acceptable to the broader community. I strongly believe dydx owes a lot to early adopters and it is unfortunate so many of them were not recognized, even if it was a fault of their own.

First, some numbers. According to epoch0 review ( https://dydx.foundation/blog/en/epoch-0 ) 67% of total rewards have been earned and claimed. This equates to 24,690,803 unclaimed tokens that went back to treasury. The claimed % has been generally high across 6 different tiers with an exception of lowest one (first one) where only 24% of tokens have been earned (representing roughly 1/3 of total unearned tokens). In terms of total number of tokens the unearned portion is less than 2.5% than circulating supply. However when taking the current float into account the picture is quite different. There are roughly 55 mln tokens in circulation after epoch0, meaning over 50% increase, were we to distribute the unearned tokens one way or another. This would undoubtably create a significant selling pressure even if only 10% of these tokens are being sold. Therefore it would be desirable to somehow filter out hodlers from sellers or to limit the overall impact of supply increase.

Reading through the forum there have been multiple solutions proposed:

Expand the claim period by another 28 days allowing anyone who missed out to earn the rewards by using L2 platform. This inevitably suffers from the community not wanting a selling pressure to crash the token price and also doesn’t reward token holders who did the homework and achieved the tasks required to earn the tokens

Do 50/50, 25/75 or any other % split, allocating some tokens to people who missed out and remaining ones to the community members who have been successful in claiming their tokens. This has the same issue in terms of selling pressure (no way of knowing that the people who were successful in earning tokens initially wouldn’t dump them right away) and also has a perception of community trying to receive extra tokens from treasury under the guise of righting a wrong

Taking the above into account and also aiming to close this topic for good so we can all move forward satisfied with the result I propose the following (take any numbers and dates as arbitrary, but judge the framework in general please):

Allow anyone who fulfilled the tasks by did not claim their tokens to claim them. I honestly think this one is the least controversial of all. People make mistakes and it’s a bit of dick move on community part to refuse them to claim tokens (pardon my French). Claim period should have been much longer

Allow anyone who missed on doing the tasks to  claim their rewards, but, given they failed at doing the task and to prevent the dumping, do it in delayed manner. For example, we can make them claimable as of 1 st of January 2022 on the condition that they trade in each epoch starting with epoch1. There are 4 epochs left till end of year, so for each epoch they complete the task, they would be receiving ¼ of their unclaimed tokens

This would achieve multiple goals of increasing overall volume of dydx, while making it more fair to anyone who did the task for the original drop. It would also delay the selling pressure by 3.5 months

I would also propose to potentially exclude the first group (which had over 8 million tokens unclaimed) as it is the group that most likely had people trying to game the system. This would significantly reduce the overall allocated amount as well. I realize that 300 $DYDX could have still been a significant amount for some people and would rather make some bastards richer than make a few less fortunate folks suffer:) I'm sure it's possible to verify each individual wallet whether they are real or not, but there are ~6K of them, and automation is certainly required to sort out the good ones

Another very important consideration to consider is how much of these calculations will take time from the core dev team. My preference would be to pursue a solution that takes the least time possible.

I’ll conclude by saying that I personally think we should find a way forward and shouldn’t look for precedents from other projects but instead look to create a precedent of our own and be an example to others in how we treat early adopters. Thank you for reading through!"

"['[DRC] Extending the ""28-day"" period post Epoch 0']","I too missed the L2 announcement and hence the airdrop. Only found out once the token was released like many others it seems.

I can understand the communities concerns regarding retroactive claims being abused by multiple wallet holders hunting for the airdrop.

And also of dilution of the supply.

How about a proposal that would incentivise genuine community participation by the users who missed the drop by automatically staking the tokens for a period (even years) on that users behalf, thus negating any potential to dump said tokens.

May I remind the community that the growth of participation in every aspect is of paramount to the success of the platform (and the objective of the airdrop) and many early supporters who could potentially help that growth will be frozen out of a community that doesn't recognise them. (Very little insentive for the future).

Stakeholders should consider the fact that there is not that many people in the world that are technically inclined enough or have the means or awareness to participate in such financial instruments and attracting them to the community is the reason for the airdrop in the first place.

Especially those who would like to be a part of the future of the project and not just dump multiple wallets of airdrop onto the open market.

If you have long term interests in dy/dx then you should consider the stutter in the long term growth curve for the platform and the affects this will cause. If you assume exponential growth this could be devasting down the line in the race to mainstream adoption.

Either way I would accept any decision from the community (or lack thereof).

"['[DRC] Extending the ""28-day"" period post Epoch 0']","I disagree. The people who missed out on the airdrop are the ones that would want to dump. I personally as a early “pioneer” L1 user still had the ability to keep up with the community in regards to the airdrop and was full aware a few weeks prior to august that the trade had to be made in august to collect rewards. Why should we pity those that were off in La La Land doing whatever they were doing and not paying attention. Also a lot of these people that are complaining are mad because they put in a lot of effort into opening a lot of wallets and paying a ton of gas fees. That is what they are made about. Because they could have made x amount of money from opening up a ton a wallets and the gas that they paid. If you invested all that time opening up these wallets you should have invested actual time in the community and you would have been okay claiming your tokens. But instead the few that are making noise are sour because they missed out. I am a long time holder and don’t plan on selling my coins for a long time. I would vote against any proposal to distribute more funds period. I’ve missed out on a few crypto airdrops myself personally but do I cry about it on the daily, no I’ve moved on. Let’s not entertain these folks, the devs are smart and put those rules in place because they already knew people would open up a ton of wallets. So making an extra trade in august was kind of proof that you would be willing to go an extra mile to claim this tokens and spend a little more money to get them. Now that the token is worth $10 and stable it’s the only reason a small minority are complaining about it. Dydx will grow regardless we don’t need a bunch of whiny mooches in our community."

"['[DRC] Extending the ""28-day"" period post Epoch 0']","@All Re:DRC

For ALL interested in the DRC proposal, in this post I will summarize the relevant docs, links, and some of my personal thoughts.

[DRC Guidelines]

Please read this first: Proposal lifecycle https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/voting-and-governance/dip-proposal-lifecycle

[What We Need]

we need a formal DRC proposal in this format ( https://github.com/dydxfoundation/dip/blob/master/DIP-X.md ) and a snapshot off-chain vote ( https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/voting-and-governance/dip-proposal-lifecycle#3-drc-snapshot-polling )

[Examples]

Take a look at the Dydx Foundation created DRC for example

Example DRC: https://forums.dydx.community/proposal/discussion/1770-drc-incident-report-of-the-safety-module-outage-proposed-solution/

Example snapshot vote: https://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/QmbJ5QxHr1pyShKTDaF5DjAr6vxQn8DVxshH2fyWgzDCBn

[My thoughts]

These tasks are not technically hard to accomplish, and I believe many of the affected users here, myself included, would like to help. But it is too much of responsibilities for a single person to write this proposal and snapshot vote in one's words and expecting the affected community members' views to be fairly represented. This, after all, is not just a few k of $, but millions of $ at stake, affecting a large dydx user base.

I suggest we should have more discussion and thoroughly consult the affected dydx users by having some form of chat group, Discord, Telegram group, etc. Then, we can put the draft (proposal + snapshot vote) together, before publishing it as a formal DRC.

The first step is done by this discussion.

T he second step needs to be done through a DRC Creation. This is when we need the more technical persons in order to work with Github.

"['[DRC] Extending the ""28-day"" period post Epoch 0']","I think L1 users were not given the fair chance and DYDX foundation should keep in mind that these were the early supporters they had and it would benefit them to allow extended period to these users as some of them are traders who trade with large amounts ,

most of the people including myself stopped using Defi trading due to huge fees and got to know about token launch or airdrop just when token started trading, its not a good decision. The timeline was also very short and it was held at the time when most of the people were on vacations and didnt actively tracked social media or crypto trading."
"['[DRC] Extending the ""28-day"" period post Epoch 0']","I think if the reward period would be extended that it would increase traffic and usage of the protocol, much more than in the first period.

The bug that happened could be buried and overlooked as well.

Having used the protocol in 2019 myself, there is much dust to uncover before I feel comfortable using in the second time.

I think it's worth considering. The proposal for governance is a brilliant idea. This is how it should be done, and judging by other treasuries in the past any form of community inclusion through incentives and fair treatment returns MASSIVELY on the entire health of the ecosystem."
"['[DRC] Extending the ""28-day"" period post Epoch 0']","It is clear that some (large) dYdX holders are thinking from their own interests. The response above shows that mostly of the whales think too self-centered not wanting to think about governance or long term.

To make this discussion land properly we should ask for the opinion of people who have absolutely no interest in it. People who have no dYdx, and who also have no right to the airdrop.

I am curious to see what the dYdX foundation will do about this. This is apparently an issue that goes beyond the decentralized governance model. An issue that is looking for a solution that doesn't look at the amount of tokens you hold, but a balanced solution where every vote is equal"

"['[DRC] Extending the ""28-day"" period post Epoch 0']","The fact that so many people missed the airdrop are here within first 1-2 days of, not like 6 months afterwards, $dydx listing on major exchanges, the airdrop reported by big media in the space like Cointelegraph, is a clear indication of the 2 things:

1) We are not a group completely disconnected from the space. We do use CEXes / DEXes and we do read and care about what's happening in Crypto, Defi, dydx included.

2) The airdrop is not well publicized to the community. Access to such information is not equal. The 'Rewards' tab and claim process are completely missing from dydx L1 page, only present in its L2 pages. See my above post for screenshots, or compare the two links by yourself.

L1: https://margin.dydx.exchange/portfolio/overview

L2: https://trade.dydx.exchange/portfolio/overview

Whether 28-day is fair or not, imho, depends on a single factor: how well the community is informed of this airdrop.

Here I want to draw a comparison to the GTC (Gitcoin) airdrop I was a part of, which had a similar short 30-day claim period. Some background first, in order to contribute to Gitcoin, all users must login their website using github credentials, so GTC had all of our email addresses. Throughout the 30-day period, I received at least 4 emails from the team explicitly asking me to claim the token right now before the expiry day.

Do I think GTC's process is perfect? Maybe No. But, its short claim period is more justified by the email notices they delivered.

dydx being a Defi / DEX protocol (the big D stands for Decentralized, mind you) does NOT require an email address, joining Discord, reading up team's blog posts, etc. to be able to use the protocol. Unlike GTC team, dydx team had no effective means to reach out to all users. That is the basis why I think this 28-day is not fair, especially for old L1 users, who can't even see 'Rewards' tab on dydx L1 page."

"['[DRC] Extending the ""28-day"" period post Epoch 0']","It is really unfortunate for most people like me. I was long time L1 user, and probably margin traded millions in volume back in days when fees used to be around $20-$200. But, fees jumped over $2k, so I switched back to binance. Since then occasionally I been checking L1 for current fees with plans to coming back, without even realizing of new L2 platform. Nothing on L1 trading page saying about new website or airdrop. I did noticed very thin trading books. And just now I accidently caught news about airdrop right after 2 days past deadline.

Oh well, bummer.

@0x3 The airdrop was supposed to reward current, active L2 users, not past users that had left the platform. If you did not even bother to check the dydx twitter for a whole month then you’re not even trying to be active.

No airdrop was not supposed to reward only active L2 users. Plus, I don't have twitter, or any other social platforms, except Facebook that I haven't logged for at least few years now. Airdrop is the marketing strategy, with potentials bringing back early first users along with new users. Thats, so you are just not thinking you got rewarded only for daily checking twitter or completing few monkey tasks."
"['[DRC] Extending the ""28-day"" period post Epoch 0']",I GROSSLY DISAGREE WITH YOU.
"['[DRC] Extending the ""28-day"" period post Epoch 0']",You sound quite sarcastic and think not giving a second chance to those that missed the airdrop claim period is in the best interest of the dydx foundation. This is now a commonwealth and it would serve dydx foundation better if we don't create a dichotomy by ignoring a 1/3 of users who were unfairly denied airdrop claims.
"['[DRC] Extending the ""28-day"" period post Epoch 0']","STOP BEING DELUSIONAL

Many of us often boast about ape'ing into the next shiny thing in crypto, the next meme, the next jpeg. We pledge loyalty to projects and teams only to abandon them within hours or days after we've made that 10x return. We celebrate the wins, but we do not talk about our losses. We boast about about others ""ngmi"" but when we ourselves forget to check in with some of the projects we used to love and find out we missed on an airdrop we get f*cking pissed.

All these complaints about 28 days not being long enough are just pity.

Here's my take:

Team: The dydx team did a great job at announcing in all their channels and beyond that there was a 28-day timeframe during which people who had not yet hit the milestones could do so. Everyone in the dydx team was available 24/7 to field questions about the milestones in the Discord, help out with specific wallet issues etc. etc. This is WAY better than any support by other DeFi teams.

Comms: Some of you say that there should have been an explicit banner or announcement on the website or app. There were announcements of the website, a new foundation site, multiple articles etc about the next steps in dYdX's roadmap. What did you expect, a f*cking banner saying ""FREE AIRDROP MONEYZ HERE!""? I bet that most of you wouldn't have noticed that.

L1 vs L2: There have been users who supported dYdX when it was still a Layer-1 application and provided ample liquidity there. Some of these users did not provide the same liquidity when L2 launched, and feel left out for not having been ""compensated"" for their earlier efforts. I personally have the most empathy for this group. However, products and markets change, especially in crypto. Even if you did not provide any more liquidity under L2, you were at least still eligible for some amount of rewards.

Uniswap Comparisons: There are a lot of salty comments about the retroactive mining campaign not being as ""fair"" as the Uniswap one. Well - let me tell you something - the Uniswap airdrop was the first of a kind, and set precedent and it is exactly because of that reason that the same model should not have been replicated, by dYdX because of airdrop bots (terrible for dilution), fake users (terrible for product dev) and fake volumes (terrible for long-term growth).

Personal Issues: I hear you, I feel you. But - like anything else in life - larger campaigns cannot make individual exceptions. C'est la vie.

Vacation/Holiday: So you live in Europe and think it's unreasonable to announce anything in August because you want to sit by the pool and sip on your shirley temple? This is crypto for f*cks sake. Things move - and they move fast. Please don't tell me you did not check the price of BTC/ETH or some shit-coin you bought in 2017 on Blockfolio on your Android phone for one whole f*cking month. This is crypto, it doesn't sleep, it doesn't wait, for anyone. Get over it.

I am a DYDX whale and will vote against any of your pity proposals."
"['[DRC] Extending the ""28-day"" period post Epoch 0']","If you missed the deadline to unlock your allocation, it is 100% your own fault. You had an entire month to make extra sure your allocation was actually unlocked, as thousands of times stated in the Discord, blog posts, docs and social media. If you had traded on Layer 2, your allocation was already unlocked, because previous Layer 2 volume did count to unlock your allocation.

Nobody with a significant stake and an IQ above 100 will vote for this garbage proposal. Stop being salty and move on.

"['[DRC] Extending the ""28-day"" period post Epoch 0']","I commend and respect all the tasks DYDX foundation has done to put up a reward program for their long/short-term users. This is indeed a brave and benevolent action. But unfortunately, the window for the claim of users reward was too short for a project that has taken quite a long time to build, and involving clients who has been with the project from the early days of which most of them were unfairly affected by the short claim period, which happen to fall in August. In my country twitter and other social media usage was banned by our unscrupulous politicalised leadership and I got no wind of the claims announcement. I just knew of it in September when I travelled to another country for a business. Many others too have cogent reasons not to have made it for the claims. Please I kindly ask the DYDX foundation to extend the (epoch 0) claim period to capture those who missed the claims, majority of who are L1 users of which I am one. Please let us build this foundation together. Please i kindly ask."
"['[DRC] Extending the ""28-day"" period post Epoch 0']","Technically, it wasn’t just a 28-day deadline. All volume on L2 was counted, so you’ve had from April when L2 launched officially until August 28th. So it was a 5-month deadline. The airdrop was supposed to reward current, active L2 users, not past users that had left the platform. If you did not even bother to check the dydx twitter for a whole month then you’re not even trying to be active.

Why are the L1 users not calculated in this? Théy were the actual first backers who just as some L2 users had to pay tremendous amounts of gasfee's to experiment with dYdX. It is too quick of an answer.

Nobody is entitled to anything. It was a free airdrop with specific requirements. I have personally missed many, many airdrops and wish I also could go back in time… Everybody had equal opportunity, that is fair. Equal outcome regardless of effort is not fair.

Agree on the first part. But I disagree on the part that everybody had a equal oppurtunity. Again, not everyone is as active as some cryptoparticipants. It is everyone or no one, this decision by the dYdX team seams to be a half-half decision: allowing certain people to get an airdrop, while others not, based on time and activity.

If you blame your missed deadline on a vacation I can’t feel sorry for you financially, a 4-week long vacation means you’re already well-off.

This makes no sense. Asking in August to do certain tasks is knowingly excluding certain people since it is the vacation period. Besides, you can also have a vacation in your garden or at the campsite in a village next door.

The L2 app did not contain detailed information about the requirements BUT if you did not then bother to look at the community docs or discord to understand how it worked then that’s totally on you.

Is it? You should expect in order to have equality and equilibrium in a decentralized governance that information asymmetry should not exist. It is a blunder by the dYdX team not to provide information on both L1 and L1 pages.

If there was no notice on L1 about the coming airdrop and that it required L2-trading, then that specific part was a blunder by the dydx team.

Happy you agree on at least one point :P

It would not be fair to those that were active to just extend the deadline after everything is said and done. They were active community members and took risks without knowing how much the airdrop would be worth.

How many were actually active, how many of the airdrop people staked their tokens? It is wrong to state those people were active members. I can name 4 people who used 5 different eth adresses to do one trade to dump them afterwards. This statement is wrong.

In the 310 token tier, 27467 wallets did not qualify for their allocation. These users never traded any volume on L1 or L2. Many of these wallets belong to airdrop hunters that just create 10+ wallets just to try to get airdrops. Frankly, I think it was almost too kind of the dydx foundation to even give these wallets a chance to qualify at all. Why would we, the active community, give out 8.5M DYDX to users that never even traded a single dollar in the past AND did not even bother to stay up to date with the project announcements?

I can not say if this is true or not, in total. However, me for example, I did not trade because I was not able to because of the high gasfees back in L1. I did transfer some eth and let is wait for some days for gasfees to drop.. which did not happen. After a couple of days I transferred it back to my wallet. Am I an airdrop hunter, well now yes, but back then definitely not. I was worries that centralized exhanges could block my funds.

dydx needed the August deadline so they could stick to their roadmap and completely decentralize the protocol as quickly as possible. Also, with a longer deadline, the volume traded in August would have been much lower, the hype around launch would have been much lower and the size of the current governance would be much lower.

They could have perfectly stick to their roadmap and make other arrangements for the people who were not on time claiming or fullfilling. We are talking about smartcontracts and tokens, they could easily build in a timer which would burn tokens the longer it took to claim/fullfill..

The tokens are way more useful to all of us when they are in the community treasury. The treasury went from 50M to 75M. That’s a huge difference and will greatly benefit the community. 80%+ of the airdrop receivers would have instantly dumped their tokens (this happens in pretty much all free airdrops), that would not have helped the protocol.

Good, we can still help the protocol. They can, f.i. , require the tokens to stay locked for x amount of time and would release them over a period of time.

There are many solutions. It aint black or white. Happy to discuss further."
"['[DRC] Extending the ""28-day"" period post Epoch 0']","100 percent support this.. DyDx should Capitalize on the situation.

MORE TRADE/ACTIVITES ON L2

In my opinion, this is also good for the dydx protocol. Extending the time means more people trading on L2, familiarizing themselves on how to use the DyDx platform and getting the experience in general.

ON TOKEN DUMPING

for those worried about the price, I wouldn't. There has been a lot of people who have learnt to keep airdrops tokens and used them for generating more tokens as a result of lessons learnt from airdrops such as uniswap, 1ich etc. dumping major airdrop tokens in my opinion has never gone well for dumpers. DyDx has some pretty juicy incentives going on that makes more sense to put your token to work than dumping.

Good for Governance.

I have my aave tokens staked since AAVE safety module was implemented. I have no plans of taking out those tokens. I have voted on several proposals and continue to do so. I don't think everyone who missed taking the task is uninterested in governance. There are people out there who are legit interested in governance and will keep the token for voting and other governance stuff.

PUBLICITY AND SETTING A GREAT STANDARD

there are some pretty famous people such as Defi_Dad who missed the airdrop and has also pleaded on the DyDx community to reconsider. reconsidering can earn good publicity for the protocol. I believe a protocol loved by the community in general will be a good thing."

It seems normal to me to extend the claim interval, let's say even if some penalties would be applied"
"['[DRC] Extending the ""28-day"" period post Epoch 0']","Technically, it wasn’t just a 28-day deadline. All volume on L2 was counted, so you’ve had from April when L2 launched officially until August 28th. So it was a 5-month deadline. The airdrop was supposed to reward current, active L2 users, not past users that had left the platform. If you did not even bother to check the dydx twitter for a whole month then you’re not even trying to be active.

"['[DRC] Extending the ""28-day"" period post Epoch 0']","I agree with this. Firstly, we might even struggle getting someone with 10k tokens to create this proposal and secondly, token holders are not going to vote in favour of diluting the circulating supply. There needs to be financial incentive for token holders.

I like option A (but I think 75/25 split is fairer): Of the unclaimed tokens, let 75% of them be allocated to people who didnt claim in epoch 0 and the other 25% allocated to those who did claim. Same mechanics as before in terms of milestones - people claiming for the first time need to hit the milestones and people claiming for the second time need to hit them again (but maybe a reduced amount considering its only for 25% of the original airdrop)."
"['[DRC] Extending the ""28-day"" period post Epoch 0']",Bypassing voting mechanism is like unlegitimizing dydx token functionality. This should never been considered at all. Destroying token functionality for 50 whinners isnt the way forward.

This is false. Anyone who fulfill all tasks can always have forever access to unlocked rewards."
"['[DRC] Extending the ""28-day"" period post Epoch 0']",L1 Trader is right. L1 users such as myself knew nothing of the airdrop until after it happened. I checked my etherscan and I have been with DYDX since 241 days ago. This feels like a really cheap shot. Those who were new to DYDX even got a fairer shake. Also when I tried to get email notification from L2 it said there was an error and never sent me any notifications on it. This is a realistic proposal and was unfair to L1's. Hell! I was even on L2 and didn't get informed!

"['[DRC] Extending the ""28-day"" period post Epoch 0']","Thank you ICA, I appriciate your job which is legit in my opinion.

Even if I have a subjective point of view (due to the fact I did not receive the aidrop) I think it is about equity for people who were involved and have participated to the project, but finally were not rewarded because they were not present in this time laps or simply did not understand the way to act.

Equity is the basis of a decentralized protocol : involvement should be rewarded.

Here the question was to be present at the right place at the right moment, even if you were not present the rest of the time and came out of the blue.

It is severe and not fair in my opinion."

** Личные мысли **

@Rugged DYDX staker В целом я согласен, однако я думаю, что еще одна вещь, которую важно сделать в приоритете, - это простота. Благодаря этому исправление выйдет быстрее и останется меньше места для ошибки.

Поэтому, я думаю, было бы лучше делать только фиксированную процентную компенсацию для затронутых адресов, а не более сложные механизмы (точный расчет платы за газ [как это переводится в сумму DYDX], скидки на торговые комиссии и т. Д.)

Как я уже сказал, я думаю, что что-то около 15-20% будет справедливым для компенсации затронутых адресов, учитывая ожидаемую прибыль за заблокированное время + плата за газ + общие проблемы"

[' Safety Staking Pool On Pause '],"Would it be possible to just use the tokens from the bugged contract to give LP tokens from the new, fixed one? That way we won't have to make new txs and start staking as soon as its live plus no additional tx would be required from our side."
[' Safety Staking Pool On Pause '],"** Can somebody who hasn't got their tokens stuck please create a proposal to apply the code fix as soon as possible. We we need to unstake/stake at by the end this month.

The compensation can be discussed while the fix is voted on."
[' Safety Staking Pool On Pause '],"First of all, thank you for initiating a vote. But my dydx is trapped in a safety staking pool and I can't vote.

In addition, if the final voting result is ""other"", will a new round of voting be launched?"
[' Safety Staking Pool On Pause '],"People are asking for way to much. You would have paid the gas fees anyway if the pool didnt get locked. And your tokens would be locked so the only thing you're missing out on is the initial APY that would have rapidly dropped as more people staked.

I missed out on staking by literally 1 second, because i clicked to stake and then it disappeared. Now I'm sitting on my tokens and I'm not getting anything at all. Shit happens. I'll stake when it opens back up.

I feel a generous compensation package for people that had their tokens locked in the contract would be:

1) 5% gains for lost interest

2) a small bonus (20-50 Dydx tokens) to cover gas fees

Anything beyond that is just silly. 500000% APY is not going to produce that level of return after a minute or two as more people flooded in and you all know it.

Another possible solution is just to airdrop a second batch of tokens to everyone that still has tokens, say 5% of your initial drop. Because honestly the pool being closed affected everyone that wanted to stake, not just the people who got in first."
[' Safety Staking Pool On Pause '],I think it is possible to open a temporary pool. Users who previously staked in safety module will be counted. We can also use part of Treasury to compensate users who previously staked in safety module.

[' Safety Staking Pool On Pause '],I'm interested to understand what early stakers who got in before the bug closed the opportunity for others were expecting to achieve had this not happened. The gas price paid for the transaction was a given at the time as well as the funds being locked for a period. So what reward were they expecting had the pool been open for others to join over the course of the Epoch?
[' Safety Staking Pool On Pause '],Non-affected Staker
[' Safety Staking Pool On Pause '],"Non-affected holder here still holding complete airdrop.

I agree with this as I had every intention of joining the staking pool but failed and had stuck TXs due to gas fee spikes.

How about us who are cheap on gas? haha

It is a bit blase of affected stakers to claim that they were trying to do the protocol a favour by putting ""capital on the line so you can sleep well at night, with no worry about black swans"" when realistically they primarily wanted early staking rewards and speed of entering the pool wouldn't affect this (we’ve been fine without a safety pool for a while now). Personally I would feel a bit upset if users who wanted to frontrun the pool are rewarded whereas those who had intentions of staking but were delayed are not.

However, these members are obviously valuable DYDX community members and regardless of financial motivation or not, are actively participating in the protocol and deserve to be compensated for their gas and unusable capital.

I suggest something similar to this, where all original airdrop holders who have claimed but not sold are rewarded the epoch 0 safety staking rewards proportional to their claim amount, with those early stakers in the pool receiving a significant % more than others.

This motivates anyone still holding their airdrop and uncertain to further participate in the protocol, as well as incentivising them to agree with the proposal and ensuring it gets pushed through.

Personally I won’t be happy with an overly generous % to early affected stakers but will accept a reasonable one as to not further delay staking."

This motivates anyone still holding their airdrop and uncertain to further participate in the protocol, as well as incentivising them to agree with the proposal and ensuring it gets pushed through (personally I won’t be happy with an overly generous % to early affected stakers otherwise)"
[' Safety Staking Pool On Pause '],I propose that we assume that everyone who was airdropped  that hasn’t sold or bought on day 1 and hasn’t sold was planning on staking and spread the rewards to everyone who held the tokens in their wallet for the entire epoch. Rewards would be based on the lowest amount of dydx your wallet held throughout epoch 1. Any untouched dydx would be rewarded as if in the safety pool. Basically the same thing as staking. Refund gas fees to the wallets that staked.
[' Safety Staking Pool On Pause '],"Early stakers should be rewarded, but not at the expense of other airdrop holders that did not get a chance to stake due to

1) short window before bug was discovered.

2) gas was too high in that window.

I don't have enough coins to start a proposal. However I suggest that the incentive structure should be paid out from the trading rewards pool rather than staking rewards pool to be fair to other airdrop holders (5-20% flat interest for 1x month)

My proposal is

1) Whitelist Tier 5 or VIP Level for the early staker wallet addresses for a period of 1-3 months. This way it a) upgrades the users to very low fees that should incentivize b) more trading (good for the protocol) and thus c) higher trading rewards for them.

2) One time 50-100 DyDx airdrop ($750-1500 at time of writing) to cover for the gas costs paid as an early mover advantage.

OR

3) 2x multiplier on trading rewards for 1-3 months."

Should the community deploy the open-sourced fix?

Yes, of course.

How should rewards from Epoch 0 be distributed to stakers in the Safety Staking Pool?

Discussions that might have financial impact are never easy and therefore I would love to have seen a proposal for this and not just an open discussion that might easily go sideways. I would agree that people who staked before the error was discovered, should receive the rewards they would have gotten otherwise. I know this might not be easy to calculate though because shall there was no error, a lot more people would have also staked.

I wouldn't agree for ""extra"" compensation for trouble or gas, to be honest."

[' Safety Staking Pool On Pause '],"** Personal thoughts **

@Rugged DYDX staker Generally, I agree, however I think another thing that is important to prioritize is simplicity. This makes the fix go out sooner, and have less room for error.

Therefore, imo, it would be best to only do a flat % compensation for affected addresses rather than more complex mechanisms (exactly calculating gas fees [how does this translate into a DYDX amount], trading fee discounts etc)

Like I said, I think something around 15-20% is fair to compensate affected addresses given the expected return for the locked time + gas fees + general hassle"
[' Safety Staking Pool On Pause '],"Everyone will have a different opinion on the OC compensation on the lost staking yield, so in the interest of time I propose the following

15% effective Staking Yield for the impacted accounts or ~60K tokens (assuming it gets done this week)

e.g., 64 accounts * ~6K tokens/each * .15 ~ 60K tokens which < 10 bps of the float assuming 600M circulating by epoch end)

Gas Refunds on (i) deposit, (ii) withdrawal and (iii) restake (only if you make a commitment to restake obviously)

1 yr Trading fee discount based on the tiers posted above by @Day28

idc about NFTs and not sure why i'd be entitled to one anyway. The rest I feel this is fair / equitable to all stakeholders and want to push this forward.

Thoughts?"
[' Safety Staking Pool On Pause '],"As someone who didn't get to participate in the staking this approach seems fair to me. People who didn't stake initially are now locked out of staking, so it's not fair that the affected addresses would get to keep the entire epoch award as some proposals have suggested. 10% compensation is on the high side because it's unlikely that the stakers would have gotten that naturally — if I could I would lock my tokens in the buggy contract to get some of that 10% reward. Something closer to 5% is more realistic. I would definitely vote yes for a 7% reward, but if there's a proposal for 10% I may still vote for it if it seems like the community at large (both affected and unaffected addresses) supports it."
[' Safety Staking Pool On Pause '],Is any way to withdraw tokens from not working contract and dont wait one month ? This option will be also satisfying for me.

I would have liked to stake in the pool myself but missed the opportunity so would like to see the APY returned to the start rate for the next epoch as well.

More and more user friendly every week."
[' Safety Staking Pool On Pause '],"Hmmm, There are a few of us out there who didn't get the chance to stake in the pool. I think there is a middle ground to be had here. I agree you guys that went straight in should be honoured with some reward. Gas and an initial bonus reward of some sort perhaps. Then I suggest we start the APY at the top price again at the beginning of the following Epoch and go from there. This rests the marketing incentive for the project, gives holders who missed out the opportunity to get in on it and hopefully this helps support price in the short term while the hype is real and excitement is at a high."
[' Safety Staking Pool On Pause '],"To me it does not seem totally crazy to reward the agreed amount of tokens to stakers.

My reasoning would be that early stakers have proven to be committed to protecting the protocol. Having us gain earn extra DYDX tokens (that would have otherwise been split among more users) and thus gain increased voting power would not be a bad thing.

Some people have received pretty crazy amounts for trading large amounts or running multiple accounts. In this perspective rewarding early believers seems fair to me.

My idea would be (if its decided to reward early stakers the agreed amount) for these tokens to be locked or vested so we cant dump them.

(I'm one of the affected addresses so i am biased and have a conflict of interest)"
[' Safety Staking Pool On Pause '],"GM.

On claim day there was a glorious band of dydx degens that went out to battle. While you were refreshing Uniswap with your paper hands, we aped into the safety pool to put our capital on the line so you can sleep well at night, with no worry about black swans attacking the protocol. You want to give us gas money?! The core believers of dydx, who were early L1 users, early L2 users, and diamond hand stakers? Get outta here.. I say we deserve statues at the dydx HQ. Or at least we get the full safety module reward for Epoch 1: 384.615 tokens, just as agreed. Pacta sunt servanda."
[' Safety Staking Pool On Pause '],"Why not split the compensation in two parts:

Compensation for gas used to stake/unstake - fixed amount distributed after fix is deployed;

Compensation for staking rewards - distributed after second epoch and calculated according realized real APR;

[' Safety Staking Pool On Pause '],"As an affected address, I would be happy with...

The fix put in place in time to unstake this month.

Compensation in DYDX for gas fees having to unstake and restake to the new contract.

[' Safety Staking Pool On Pause '],"Thanks. Personally, I’d be happy with a 10% compensation.

Will we need to unstake from the old contract and stake on the new? Because then the gas fees would be very impactful but only for the smaller stakers."
[' Safety Staking Pool On Pause '],"Unfortunately, I'm one of the addresses. I spend a lot of gas, which is very expensive for me.

[' Safety Staking Pool On Pause '],If the community does not vote ?
[' Safety Staking Pool On Pause '],"** Personal thoughts **

Good thoughts on this thread overall.

I think we should recognize that by far the most important piece is to get the fix passed as soon as possible. This will enable affected addresses to regain their funds, and make the Safety Pool live for everyone asap. The upgrade must pass the long timelock which requires 10% of the max supply to vote yes. This will require both broad community support, as well as governance participation from dYdX investor token holders.

The main point of discussion seems to be around the level of compensation to offer the addresses that were affected by the error. The effect on them will be that their funds are locked until the fix is enabled through governance - likely a couple weeks at least. However, remember that the staking contract only processes withdrawals on a monthly timeline anyways, so even if this issue hadn't happened their tokens would be locked for that long.

Therefore, it seems reasonable to compensate them similarly to the amount they reasonably could have expected to earn by staking over that timeframe, plus potentially a bit extra for the trouble. To me, a staking APR of 50% for non-stablecoin on DeFi would be considered generous - even right after launch. Given this, I would suggest doubling this APR and rounding up to get to a compensation for the month of 10% of the value staked for each address affected.

--

Summary:

Governance should prioritize getting the fix out asap

We will need broad voting participation from the community and investors

10% compensation in DYDX seems appropriate to me, but I could see going a bit higher"
[' Safety Staking Pool On Pause '],"** Personal thoughts **

I don't think anyone could have reasonably expected the 500,000% APR+ rates to have persisted for more than a few minutes.

I agree there should be compensation for the affected stakers, but something in the 5-20% range for the month seems more reasonable to me."
[' Safety Staking Pool On Pause '],"** Personal thoughts **

The extremely high APR was not likely to last for more than a few minutes, so I don't think it is reasonable to extrapolate that level of return out for an entire month.

I agree there should be some amount of % compensation for addresses that deposited before access to the pool was removed from. To me, somewhere in the 5-10% range sounds right - this would lead to a 60-120% APR which is on the very high side of what I would expect"
[' Safety Staking Pool On Pause '],"I'm one of the adresses and I totally agree. I paid a lot of gas to be first in the pool to get 500K% APY staking yield.

When will we know what next? I see that there are about 70 addresses in the contract.

I am very shocked by the whole case."
[' Safety Staking Pool On Pause '],"How, I can vote if my dydx is a blocked?"
[' Safety Staking Pool On Pause '],It would be naive to think that the APY would remain above triple digits for more than a few blocks. I'm on your side - I want to maximize comp. Also think that asking for 10x what you staked is never going to be approved in governance.
[' Safety Staking Pool On Pause '],"I’m one of the adresses in the staking pool, so take my opinion with a grain of salt.

I think that a compensation for the opportunity cost + risk + gas fees is obviously warranted.

Not giving a compensation would make clear that governance has little appreciation for the safety pool stakers. That’d be worrying because governance is also going to chose which events the safety pool stakers are on the line for.

Basically, if governance is unfair to safety pool stakers now, holders may expect unfairness later and choose not to stake."
[' Safety Staking Pool On Pause '],"Ty and agree the fix should be pushed asap, BUT hard to argue that the opportunity cost of missing 500K% APY staking yield (@1370% daily) is offset by a 10% bonus (assume 6K *10% (600) * $10/each = $6k) + gas refunds ($1k) + illiquid NFTs ($ TBD) + trading discount (based on future usage which I promise you after this fiasco I will not be utilizing).

Assuming the daily yield of 1370%, if you staked 6K tokens and took the rug for everyone else before the bug was found you should be entitled to at least that many tokens on Day 1. I can certainly accept not being entitled to 42K% monthly given boost TVL (500K%/12) but for 1 day of staking 6K tokens I would have receive 13x as many, so the ""rugged stakers"" should get at least 80k - 100k tokens.

Hard to put this in $ / ROI terms considering, we won't get the tokens for a month and we don't know how much lower / higher the token price will be at that time, but considering the banner advertisement and the opportunity cost, I think this is fair."
[' Safety Staking Pool On Pause '],"This makes a lot of sense. Also, the worst case scenario for everyone is a long governance vote that takes months. Lets push this forward as quickly as possible, what would be the soonest we can draft a proposal?"
[' Safety Staking Pool On Pause '],"The fact that the staking pool is not live for an epoch has the following problems:

Full circulating supply on the market with little incentive to hold besides trading fees.

dydx "" vulnerable"" in case of a shortfall event (unlikely but possible )

People depositing early were quite unlucky but did help others in not losing on the opportunity cost that comes to being stuck in a zero yield pool.. Also, it can be a bullish event that it will not add additional circulating supply at the end of the month.

Compensation should consist in:

Refund of gas cost for deposit + withdrawal calculated at the amount of gwei used to deposit and paid in DYDX.

Additional 10% on the deposited amount,

Unique NFTs

Lifetime trading fee discounts on the TIER they fall into, basted on deposited amount.. So people will get at most a max 3 tier discount...

Tier

I ≥ 100

II ≥ 1,000

III ≥ 5,000

IV ≥ 10,000

The fix should be pushed asap."
[' Safety Staking Pool On Pause '],"Would be insane to not offer retroactive rewards for Stakers based on a banner headline advertising 500,000% APY. Safety Module Stakers could've sold the airdrop for $70K, but chose to backstop the protocol and are currently neither earning yield and don't have their tokens to take profit. The whole point of being the first TVL (or ""apeing into the staking contract"" which was audited) is to earn the bulk of the distribution. There should 100% be retroactive compensation based on the tokens the 64 effected addresses would have earned."
[' Safety Staking Pool On Pause '],"Regarding the open-sourced fix, I guess there is no alternative for a sustainable decentralized protocol.

Regarding compensation, probably amount of tokens sent to the contract + gas fees rebate + 5-10% interest per month would seem adequate - all paid in Dydx tokens. It's a small amount and would get the protocol off to a good start so people feel comfortable depositing to the Safety Module again.

Also an NFT or POAP for impacted users would be great, happy to help with that if needed."

[' Safety Staking Pool On Pause '],I think they should get a small compensation for being locked out. Say 5% interest on their tokens.

['DRC: First initiatives for the DAO'],"Hey LITE,

These are some really good ideas! Especially the stop market. This sound like it would give dYdX an edge!

Your first idea about swapping for USDC made me think...

How about working to get the dYdX governance token listed as collateral on Compound, CREAM, Aave etc...

Feels like a wise move.

Not only would listing the the dYdX governance token on these lending protocols drive massive awareness to dYdX meaning more users and profit

It would also make the dYdX token productive!

Seems like this would be a great first thing for the protocol.

What do you think?

Personally i'm curious about what can be done with the treasury, can we for example swap a part of it for USDC and try to seek yield on DEFI platform like DyDx spot/margin exchange or compound or else (Maple/Centrifuge).

On the design question, i think we need to make the spot/margin exchange and the perpetual one work more in symbiosis (Same UI, Same feature,Layer 2 upgrade if possible)

One last thing on the trading side, we should add stop market if possible, if not we should incentivize as much as we can taker order to allow the filling of the stop limit order.

However, after slowly realizing the token has zero earnings potential (outside of demand to reduce trading fees), I'm pretty disappointed, and don't see dydx reaching it's goal of becoming the largest, without some kind of economic incentive to hold the token.

Pancakeswap, which is likely on the decline but still at 4x marketcap of dydx, heavily incentivized people to hold their CAKE token by providing a high reward APY for staking, and by some % of the trading fees going to buying back the token and burning it. I think CAKE was too aggressive with their emissions, but it did attract many holders of the token.

Becoming ""the largest exchange"" means also capturing the long tail of smaller traders, not just the big fish. I bought dydx token and I'm staking USDC in your market maker pool, and I like the idea of owning the exchange, but to me, owning means making money when dydx does well, not just voting on some minor things when there's a problem :). It's just not as exciting to own as CAKE is.

BNB does well because it's an entirely separate chain, and you can stake the token to earn more BNB, and there are some binance connections. The dydx token doesn't have as much value, and won't have as much demand, and therefore won't have as many excited users who will evangelize the platform.

I think most current defi project founders/devs are scared of distributing revenues due to the possibility of SEC coming after them soon (they already began as we've seen with UNI). I believe it could be a solution to do so after the token launch if they had never promised to do so beforehand, especially if it was something ""summoned"" by community members (the request and act of distributing revenues/part of it to token holders).

The optimal state of current dao's is with governance being fully in control of token holders (e.g. Yearn Finance) which have control of treasury resources and final say on what devs (which are paid by treasury finds, in accordance to what governance deems appropriate) - we would need for dydx to have a multisig wallet with known community members and potentially have dydx trading accounting as 1(or 2 or 3) voting members in a 5+ address multisig wallet which manages community treasury.

Options are infinite, dydx just needs to be willing to decentralize control of their creation. Obviously, I believe they would be entitled to hold a good (but healthy) portion of protocol governance tokens (say 5-10%) and maintain a similar status to what executive board members do in trad biz nowadays.

Only time will tell us how willing our dydx frens are to move towards full decentralization."
['Is%20the%20team%20thinking%20to%20share%20exchange%20revenue%20to%20stakers%3F'],"As was mentioned in « DRC: First initiatives for the DAO » topic, «dYdX is uniquely positioned to have one of the most formidable DAOs in defi». Sounds great, but before reaching this goal we all should have a «rough consensus» about what DAO is.

We all understand that the concept of DAO (first mentioned by Vitalik in 2014) is not fully formed today, and there is no one correct answer to the questions of what DAO is, what are the structural elements of DAO and what goals should DAO strive. Everyone who is interested in DAO’s can dive into the subject here "" DAO landscape "" or here "" 15 ways... "", but for now I’d want to consider two questions related to the subject of discussion:

- DAO as a decentralized way for making decisions;

- DAO as a new type of LLC.

DAO as a decentralized way for making decisions

May be the only undoubtable question in DAO discussions: DAO-tokens must give to its holders the opportunity to take part in decision-making process: decisions about treasury management, partnerships, design etc. (more examples on snapshot ).

DAO as a new type of LLC

Before making a point I’d want to raise few questions :

1. Where is the line between dYdX Trading Inc and dYdX Foundation? Are decisions made by community mandatory for development team of LLC? How can we formalize and describe the relations between Foundation and LLC?

2. Following from the first question – what is the spectrum of decisions which can be made by Foundation? Can we formalize the list of this decisions (as in the corporate charter of LLC)? Are there any decisions which can’t be made by Foundation?

For example, in the topic « Move from USDC collateralisation to DAI or ETH » I see the answer from dYdX Foundation «Currently due to technical restriction, it will hard to support multi collateral on the protocol» - does it mean that some kind of official representative from Foundation can «kill» the proposals which are, from his point of view, too technically complicated? And who at the end can decide is the proposal technically acceptable or not?

3. And one more question following from the first question – is community entitled to demand the information about, for example, project revenues? In topic « Where are generated trade fees going? » I see the answer «the dYdX Trading Inc is collecting the fees». There is no doubt that fees should cover the transaction expenses and development team wages. But should the community be aware of the size of this fees and their distribution? Or be aware of financial records of dYdX Trading?

It’s obvious that the answer to the question about revenue sharing depends on the answers to the above questions. However I’ll try to describe my point about revenue sharing for DAO-project like dYdX .

1. I like the concept «DAO is a new type of LLC». But the main feature of being legal entity participant is to be entitled for the part of revenue generated by this entity. Without sharing revenue this concept will never be achieved.

2. I also like the idea of revenue sharing because:

 from my point of view at this moment governance token have real value for market makers (which want to be admitted to the platform) and for projects with tokens (in a broad sense, including indexes). But for me as an ordinary platform user it doesn’t bring any clear benefits. It’s like if 7-11 near my house would organize a surveys in every week basis and formalize the process of implementation of decisions made through this surveys. It’s cool. I’d be happy to see that 7-11 is ready to take my opinion into account (moreover – to regard it as binding), but would I pay for the right to be the part of this process (or pay for token to have this opportunity)? Me personally – no.

adding new markets, managing the treasury etc. – all this are questions which need time and some competences from community to formulate the best decision. In fact, they are management questions which in LLC are making by governing bodies (board of directors etc). And the participants of this governing bodies are getting part of projects’s revenue for the decisions they make. From my point of view situation in DAO decision-making is quite the same.

the announcement about dYdX plans for sharing revenue (even if it’s all about small fraction of revenue – let’s say, 5% of fees) could create the unique precedent and draw the attention of thousands new users.

In the same time I should note that the community decision-making power leads to more new questions. For example, who must technically implement the decision made by community? What will be the relations between token holders and development team? What will be the role of dYdX Trading if the power will move to community?

Looks like there are more new questions in my post than comments about forum thread. Sry about that, hope to see your thoughts about the topic and as many «you’re not right» as possible."

DYDX and Antimatter share the same goal in building a highly-decentralized trading platform. DYDX focuses on futures trading while Antimatter is determined in taking option trading/leveraged token trading to the next level.

Antimatter ($MATTER) is currently listed on Kucoin, Poloniex, Uniswap and Sushiswap.

Earlier this month $MATTER became the most trending asset on Coingecko.

Antimatter market cap is around 30m USD right now the community is quite active with nearly 100K members in Telegram and Twitter.

Alameda Research is the market maker of $MATTER on Kucoin and Poloniex.

also, listing DYDX itself is really a request from the community."
['Adding New Markets'],"Conversely, $LDO.

It is the largest liquid staking protocol with ETH, SOL, and LUNA already live - drawing ~$6.5B of TVL ( https://defillama.com/protocol/lido).

There are currently NO venues to leverage trade the token and it has not yet been listed on any major CEX.

Additionally, a LDO/ETH price feed is currently active on Chainlink ( https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/crypto-eth/ldo-eth) and it should be trivial to convert it or add a LDO/USD feed as it's as simple as fixing the denominator.

Per @Evgeny Gaevoy | Wintermute 's framework:

✅ Oracle data - Chainlink Oracle already live.

❓ Regulatory approval - Not entirely sure, maybe the lack of CEX listings comes from concerns here?

✅ General public interest - Disclaimer: I don't own any LDO myself, but I think it would be beneficial to the overall liquidity for all pairs on dYdX (where I mainly trade) in the long run.

From my personal view, I think that there would be a great amount of interest in creating a venue for deep liquidity margin trading for LDO. Given Lido's position in the liquid staking market ( https://dune.xyz/LidoAnalytical/Lido-Finance-Extended) and the quality of ETH depositors (~50% ""whales"" - depositing 10,000+ ETH; https://dune.xyz/KIV/Lido-Deposits), that is a lot of LDO not being put to use.

❓ Market Making Support - Depends entirely on whether Lido passes the necessary compliance/risk/liquidity requirements for each MM. Again, maybe there is a reason for no CEX listings here and it might be due to the regulatory concerns above. However, as a pure governance token - my surface level view tells me that it *should* be ok, given that there also seemed to be some degree of desire for a DYDX market - which possesses a similar token function.

Would be interested to hear in any commentary from MMs on whether this seems feasible, and from the DYDX team on whether they would be willing to entertain the idea of adding this new market."

['Adding New Markets'],"I believe RocketPool's token ( RPL ) should eventually be added to the protocol. Ethereum is transitioning to proof-of-stake and RocketPool is one of the few projects that is actively working on a truly decentralized staking pool solution. After many years of development, they are less than a month away from launching to mainnet (October 6th).

Currently, there is no way for the people to really speculate on the success or failure of the RPL token as there does not exist a leveraged market for it.

However, I cannot ignore the challenges that face this market at this time. Currently, there are very few exchanges that list RPL so a supermajority of its daily volume is on Uniswap -- this makes for a rather terrible Oracle for our purposes since that data would only be updated every block.

To Evgeny's point, maybe we should be evaluating each potential market from a feasibility point of view before we discuss onboarding them?"

['Adding New Markets'],definitely
['Adding New Markets'],"Not sure this thread will be very successful in making decisions on new tokens being listed unless we make it a bit more structured. I strongly feel we should accelerate this aspect because speed of adding new products has been a major feedback point from us to dydx team.

From my understanding there are several prerequisites to an asset being added (most of which are mentioned above):

Oracle data

Regulatory approval

General public interest

Market Making Support

Only if you have all four, it makes sense to go on and vote to include an asset and add it to smart contract. Going through each of them in order:

Oracle data is generally available for a lot of things, but not for more esoteric ones like punks price floor or power perpetuals.

Regulatory approval is a pretty big hurdle and it is not clear how the community can move it forward, i.e. what is the format of legal advice dydx would be comfortable with? Wintermute would be keen to assist in obtaining this legal advice in certain cases where perpetuals to be added are commercially/strategically interesting, but we need to know the requirements.

General public interest can be taken from coingecko volumes, but it is not necessarily best metric for emerging products - best example is DYDX token itself - would have been amazing to launch it (the perpetual) on the token launch - a massive missed opportunity in my opinion. There will be more prominent token launches going forward - you often see FTX capitalizing on them, launching perpetuals before anyone else. dydx can do the same, but it needs to organize itself to be nimble enough first

Finally, something that is not mentioned is market maker support. One simple example - Wintermute doesnt trade XMR and ZEC because we dont touch privacy coins. Other market makers might be more relaxed with these, but wouldnt be able to market make index products liek DPI. Point is you need to either ensure or incentivise (or better both) liquidity support prior to launch or face empty books.

Might be that we should be creating a matrix is google sheets, ticking each of the four boxes and launching a vote, once it is all ready. might be there should be a seprate working group focusing on regulatory approval (with a dedicated budget).

Most importantly we should organize this process better and not just shill perps we want to get added"

XMR liquidity in the Defi space is basically non-existent right now. A platform for Defi users that offers 'real' liquidity, margin, and rewards could bring in many unique users specifically looking for XMR exposure.

A lot of these coins will be great future additions, but most already have sufficient liquidity through AMM and exchanges. This is not true for XMR. XMR has always had liquidity or implementation problems (mostly because of compliance issues) despite the steadily increasing number of daily transactions and users.

I think XMR should be at the top of the queue!"

    As the earliest fan of dydx, I continued to pay attention to this project last year and applied to be the first test member. Soon I was honored to receive a test whitelist invitation from your team. It was in March. At that time, the GAS fee of the Ethereum network was ridiculously high. During my attempt to deposit coins on the platform, I encountered Many obstacles, I spent a lot of time and some expenses to participate in the test experience, very lucky to be the first batch of test members. In the next few months, I recommended a lot of friends to the platform. Until last month, your platform announced airdrop rewards. When I opened the dydx website, I found that the number of airdrops in my account was 0, which made me I was discouraged, and then I learned that it was because American users were banned, but I am not a US user, my IP is Hong Kong, and there is no relevant law in Hong Kong. The friends I invited all got airdrops, and many of them never traded futures. Of users have also received generous returns. But as an early whitelist user, my airdrop was 0, and I also saw that my address cannot be traded, I don't understand why. When I entered the platform test for the first time, the US IP was unable to participate in the test, but I successfully participated in the entire test. I am not a US IP, but my account has nothing. The dydx reward is displayed as 0, and then I found it. Community volunteer, he deceived me and did not help me to appeal. He told me that there was no possibility. I gave up at the time, so that I missed writing to you earlier. I'm sorry. Today I saw that my friend got the dydx reward that he lost because of the IP by writing to you. I envied him because he was not an early fan and got your help. So I also hope that through this email, you can help me unlock my account and make up for my loss as an early whitelisted user.

There's https://github.com/SixtantIO/rfc6979 which is a primitive for the ECDSA signatures for Starkware orders, and https://github.com/SixtantIO/dydx-starkware for higher level hashing and signing of orders. We open sourced these because we think dYdX is a next generation trading platform, and while the excellent Python and JS client libraries probably already cover ~80% of potential API users, we hope that adding a JVM client pushes that number closer to 90%.

From our point of view, this venue is the future of trading, and the more people participating here, the better."
['Borrower - Sixtant'],"Hey everyone!

I'm Josu, one of the co-founders of Sixtant, along with Matt. We'll be more than happy to answer any questions you may have.

We've been making markets on dydx since they launched their L2, and we have recently passed 0.5B of accumulated maker volume on the platform.

We focus mostly on CLOBs, so dydx has been our first large incursion into DeFi, and it has truly been a delight to integrate with the platform. Thanks to the really great design of their API, we have been able to fully integrate dydx into our trading system, and treat it just like any other CEX.

As stated in the brief description above, our approach to markets is beta neutral, and we don't usually take any inventory risk. Along with the market making, we also run a small market neutral prop trading operation, which for now is just open to employees and a few selected LPs.

If you want to know a bit more about our operation, we recently did an AMA with the dydx team: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVS0IytKZRE"
['Borrower - Wootrade / Kronos Research'],"I watched your dydx interview, great stuff!"
['Borrower - Wootrade / Kronos Research'],"Hi everyone! This is Ben Yorke, representing WOO Network (and Kronos Research).

Prior to dYdX, our focus was on liquidity provision and market making across global centralized exchanges. dYdX's innovation towards scalability and gas-free transactions presented us with an excellent opportunity to shift our services into DeFi.

dYdX is certainly a game-changer from a vision, product, and execution perspective, delivering stellar trading performance similar to that of centralized exchanges. These reasons, coupled with the elimination of custodial risk presented us with a clear reason to scale our trading algorithms towards dYdX.

Kronos Research as a multi-strategy firm specializes in more high frequency and arbitraging strategies, and Wootrade is a liquidity pool that connects deep liquidity across CeFi and DeFi exchanges at a low cost. These two companies work in tandem to provide this liquidity onto dYdX.

We look forward to playing a major role in the dYdX ecosystem. That includes being active in the forum and proposing/voting on key governance issues. We want to have discussions here to find out how we can provide more value to the users and future token holders.

For more information, we've had an AMA with dYdX earlier that explains in greater detail how we operate: https://dydx.exchange/blog/ama-recap-wootrade

We've been active on dYdX for some time but recently ramped up our activities following the L2 launch. Since we're active market makers/traders on all the various CEX's, integrating with dYdX has been almost plug-and-play. As a firm, we've been active in DeFi since 2018 (we were market makers for many of the 1st gen DEX's, which didn't really work out). Amber was built with the view that transparency and open financial systems make markets more efficient. We support multiple initiatives in the ecosystem, investing and interacting with protocols, providing liquidity, backstopping liquidations, and more.

We're also an investor in dYdX and are really excited to see what the future holds for the protocol, as well as the DEX/derivative space in general."
