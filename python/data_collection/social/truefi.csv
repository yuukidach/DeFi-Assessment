['xTRU: Auto-Compounding stkTRU'],"
xTRU: Auto-Compounding stkTRU
Rationale
The current value proposition behind stkTRU is that stkTRU holders can earn a portion of interest earned by the protocol which gives TRU inherent value. Currently, TRU rewards are offered on top of this to incentivize deposits. A lot of community members are asking for a “restake” functionality in TrueFi. In addition, stkTRU cannot be used on an AMM, the account which owns the stkTRU is entitled to the rewards, and AMMs do not have the ability to claim TRU or tfUSDC rewards from stakers. This proposal encourages the creation of a new token called xTRU, which automatically compounds TRU rewards earned through the contract’s stkTRU balance. In addition, fees are used to buy TRU and stake it back into the contract, thus allowing the value of one token to increase in it’s TRU value over time.
Implementation

A new token is created called xTRU, which pools stkTRU in a single contract
Deposit stkTRU or TRU into the xTRU contract in exchange for a share of the pool
TRU farmed through stkTRU rewards are re-deposited back into the contract for stkTRU
User shares are tracked so that their stkTRU balance grows as the pool compounds
tfUSDC earned are used to buy more TRU and stake the TRU back into the xTRU pool
xTRU can be used on AMMs to increase liquidity for stkTRU
xTRU/ETH or xTRU/USDC pair can be incentivized through a farm an offramp for xTRU

Open to thoughts or feedback. Anyone can develop this since it is only wrapping functions on top of existing smart contracts. This could be a good hackathon project for a solidity developer or TRU funded grant.",30,225.8,2021-09-13
['xTRU: Auto-Compounding stkTRU'],"We shouldn’t make a new contract that will utilize the old one, stacking one on top of another, because it will just make everything unnecessarily complex and gas costly. Smaller TRU holders are already cut out of the system and there is no point in staking less than already a pretty big amount of TRU. If we stack more logic on top of each other, it would be even worse. We need to upgrade the way the currently existing staking contract works, to not distribute new TRU through claiming but just increase stkTRU value (that being said, I keep in mind, that we will still need to keep the claiming mechanism for stablecoin dividend). Or we should just introduce a new staking contract and migrate.
Also, we shouldn’t really run two separate contracts of similar nature alongside.
Upgrade or migrate.
Migration would be cleaner in terms of process and architecture. Upgrade would support smaller stakers.",22,64.2,2021-09-21
['xTRU: Auto-Compounding stkTRU'],"I am strongly in favour of anything that allows auto-compounding for smaller stakers (like me).  With the current situation I need to wait a long time to earn enough from staking before it’s worthwhile withdrawing it (due to gas costs) and then why would I re-stake what I’ve earned? as it’s yet another gas tax applied on the way in.
Claimable tfUSDC grows so slowly I can’t see a time that I will ever be claiming it as it’s not worth the gas cost so I agree with this being paid in TRU instead and staked back into the pool to get the compounding effect.",15,12.8,2021-10-01
['xTRU: Auto-Compounding stkTRU'],this sounds very reasonable to me… sure gas is not as crazy as 4-6 weeks ago but it’s still 15-30$ to do pretty much anything x2 to claim and stake that can certainly eat into the 26.69% ROI.,14,17.4,2021-10-03
['xTRU: Auto-Compounding stkTRU'],"The benefit of this system is that the people entering / exiting xTRU would pay to claim+restake. Smaller users would only have to pay once to enter / exit, which would be the cost of stake() + claim(). Over time, the TRU will compound so holding longer would eventually offset the cost of the restaking",10,16.6,2021-10-12
['[Proposal] Oct 7 - 21 TrueFi LP Incentives'],"Authors: @tylerw, @ryan.rodenbaugh
Summary
Decrease total LP emissions by 5% from 270,000 TRU/day to 256,500 TRU/day.

Decrease total tfTUSD emissions by 2,500 TRU/day to 27,500 TRU/day.

In line with the ongoing tfTUSD pool migration, incentive emissions will be shifted to 80/20 between tfTUSD in the liquidity gauge and legacy tfTUSD.
22,500 TRU/day to tfTUSD in liquidity gauge
5,000 TRU/day to legacy tfTUSD farm


Decrease tfUSDC by 10,000 TRU/day to 140,000 TRU/day
Decrease tfUSDC by 1,000 TRU/day to 89,000 TRU/day

These changes will go into effect around noon PT on Thursday, October 7, 2021, if approved.
Background
Keeping with the cadence started on June 15, we’d like to reevaluate the LP TRU incentives every two weeks to (1) gradually decrease emissions over time and (2) target utilizations near 60-70% for each pool.
Motivation

Recent community sentiment has supported lower TRU reward emissions to lenders
Current utilization rates are fairly low (43%)
This proposal aims to reduce rates incrementally until TrueFi pools near target utilization (60-70%). Current utilization:

tfTUSD (~25%) = well below target utilization
tfUSDC (~35%) = well below target utilization
tfUSDT (~55%) = slightly below target utilization


Base interest rates across DeFi markets remain low for stablecoins (~5% on Aave/Compound)
Adjusting emissions gradually based upon utilization rates helps us test and build a sustainable, long-term model for TrueFi lender incentives

Specification
For: YES, implement proposal
Against: NO, keep current incentives

['[Idea] Reimburse gas fees for migrations'],"Background:

As part of the TrueFi V4 launch, all current lending pool farm incentives will be migrated to the Liquidity Gauge next Thursday, August 26th. This model greatly simplifies farming TRU, replacing the existing farms for tfTUSD, tfUSDC, and tfUSDT. Beginning August 26th, lenders can stake any of the lending pool tokens into the Liquidity Gauge to earn farm rewards as outlined in this blog post.
TrueFi will begin migrating the existing TUSD pool & tfTUSD farm (which will now be called the “legacy TUSD pool” and “legacy tfTUSD farm”) to TrueFi’s more scalable and more secure V2 lending pool design also starting next Thursday, August 26th. As highligted in this blog post, the upgrade will bring TrueFi’s TUSD pool onto the upgraded pool contract framework used by tfUSDC and tfUSDT.

Proposal:


Reimburse gas costs for users who need to migrate funds. Recipients would include:

tfUSDC and tfUSDT lenders who migrate from the existing tfUSDC and/or tfUSDT farms to the new liquidity gauge
Legacy tfTUSD lenders who migrate to the new tfTUSD pool and liquidity gauge


Reimburse gas rates in a fair, easy-to-understand fair structure

Reimburse X gas per lending pool migration (where X = 90% of expected total gas fees)
Reimburse Y gas per farm pool migration (where Y = 90% of expected total gas fees)
For converting gas to TRU, use the median gas price during the week (up to a max of 40 gwei) and the TRU/ETH price from CoinGecko for the week



Points for discussion:

Pros:

Providing reimbursements helps users with small balances continue to participate in TrueFi.
Reimbursements should reduce friction for migrations and ensure that a high % of funds move from to the new liquidity gauge and to new tfTUSD.


Concerns / Questions:

Setting up such a reimbursement program may be tricky to implement and take significant time / resources from TrueFi’s contributors.
Bad actors may be able to game the system. This proposal should not incentivize users to make transactions when gas is most expensive and should not enable users to recoup >100% of their gas costs.
Bad ROI: small wallets that migrate may incur far higher costs in gas fees (and TRU reimbursements) than they are worth through a financial lens.


Next steps

Establish expected gas costs (denoted by X and Y above). Once contracts are live, devs can provide the expected amounts of gas used for each transaction and we can set the flat-rate reimbursement amounts for each migration. If rates do not vary widely between USDC/TUSD/USDT, my recommendation would be to set flat-rates that apply to all pools.
Determine total TRU budget to allocate to this program. This number will be based upon the expected gas used per transaction and the expected number of migrations across TrueFi pools.

['[Idea] Reimburse gas fees for migrations'],"I have to say that I like this idea. UMA does this for governance voting and they use a disperse.app function call to efficiently distribute the reimbursed UMA direct to everyone’s wallet at a low per-user gas cost. It should be relatively simple to make a query to see which wallets migrated and then disburse the TRU. So I don’t see this as especially complicated to implement and certainly a goodwill gesture to the lending community, some of whom may have relatively modest amounts that they intended to leave in the vault a year or more.
Maybe set a deadline that you have to migrate within ten days to get your gas reimbursed (that’s two weekends to try to catch low gas prices).
But in general, I would try to discourage these kinds of migrations. I’ve seen on another project where over $10 million of value was in a deprecated pool for over four months. I’m not sure what happened to all these people, but the project was going to deprecate the interface, meaning that those people would have to do a smart contract call on Etherscan to get their money back. So please don’t deprecate the interface if you want to see those investors participating again.
One comment I would say if you anticipate this kind of thing happening, to build a self-destruct mechanism into the next version of the vault smart contract so that it can return any money beyond a minimum that’s outstanding after the vault is deprecated after a reasonable time period.",31,81.2,2021-08-23
['[Idea] Reimburse gas fees for migrations'],"Farm rewards are slated to migrate tomorrow around 11am PT and I’d like to get a snapshot proposal up for reimbursements live before then. Let me know whether you think the revised proposal below is a good idea:
~~
Revised Proposal
Goal:
Reimburse ~90% of gas costs (at up to 50 Gwei) for users who complete any of the following migrations:

legacy tfTUSD pool → new tfTUSD pool & liquidity gauge
existing tfUSDC farm  → liquidity gauge
existing tfUSDT farm  → liquidity gauge

Budget:

Allocate up to 50,000 TRU (~$30,000 USD as of today) towards this program from the TRU supply’s unallocated incentives
Reimbursements will be available to users who migrate within the next 30 days (by midnight UTC 9/25/21), on a first-come, first-served basis. If the allocated TRU does not cover all reimbursements, governance can decide to adjust this program

Proposal details:

Reimburse users in TRU
Amount of TRU received based upon flat gas reimbursements per migration, gas prices at time of migration, and TRU and ETH prices at time of migration. See below for details

Gas reimbursement amounts per migration:

1,470,000 gas per TUSD pool + farm migration
450,000 gas per USDC farm migration
450,000 gas per USDT farm migration

Mechanics:

Gas will be converted to ETH at the median gas price for the day (UTC time) in which the migration was completed, up to a maximum of 50 Gwei

ETH transaction costs will be converted to TRU at the average daily TRU/ETH price across Sushiswap and Uniswap

Eligble users: this program aims to avoid overcompensation (e.g. it should not reimburse someone $100 in TRU for moving $1 worth of tfTUSD). Therefore, wallets must migrate at least 500 tfTUSD, at least 50 tfUSDC, or at least 50 tfUSDT to receive reimbursement
Only 1 migration per token per wallet will be reimbursed (i.e. one wallet moving multiple chunks of tfTUSD only receives one reimbursement)
Reimbursements will be distributed to wallets within 7 days of the conclusion of the program on 9/25/21

P.S. - Running reimbursements like this is inherently complicated, but I’m confident we can run this w/o too much overhead, similar to how we did for the Sushi LP compensation.",28,65.6,2021-08-26
['[Idea] Reimburse gas fees for migrations'],"Over 90% of funds have now migrated (see the update from Discord I pasted below) and there hasn’t been much talk or support for gas reimbursements.
Given the migration’s progress and success so far, I think there’s less need for this than I anticipated. If we move forward with a reimbursement, I now think it should be smaller scale than what I originally proposed.
///
Update on the ongoing migration of TrueFi farms + TUSD pool:
Overall status: 


90% of TrueFi funds have been migrated to the new liquidity gauge / multifarm

Over $900M staked is now in liquidity gauge
98% of USDC and USDT pool tokens now staked in the liquidity gauge
TUSD is split 50/50 between the legacy farm and liquidity gauge (as expected, given TRU rewards are split 50/50 btw legacy farm and liquidity gauge)



TUSD has migrated 50/50 to the new tfTUSD pool (as expected given 50/50 rewards split)

there’s now ~$60M in the new TUSD pool  (and ~$60M in the legacy TUSD pool)

I am a small-time liquidity provider (14000 TUSD) and TRU staker (3000 TRU). This migration is cost-prohibitive for me. I entered my tfTUSD position through Uniswap to save on the exorbitant gas fees that would otherwise disproportionately eat at my returns. I am truly trying to save wherever possible because it does make an impact for me. Going into my position, I wanted to allocate capital to both TUSD and truefi for diversification purposes, away from other stablecoins and platforms, for a long time horizon. Deposit & forget.
Under current conditions, I’m slated to generate $450 interest in another 11 months. That’s fine if I expect to pay $15 to enter and $50 to exit. But heaping on a migration that costs $200 under ideal network conditions nets me a meager 1.5% interest.

['[Idea] Borrowers can stake TRU in order to increase their credit limits'],"Idea: Allow borrowers to stake TRU in order to increase their credit limits beyond the unsecured limit that our credit team is comfortable with
Loom of me walking through this proposal  ← Watch the Video (can be on 2x speed)
Why Do This?

Get borrowers more involved in and invested in the success of the protocol
More usage and utility for TRU
Increases protocol TVL and utilization (in a safer way)

With our new credit model, we’re taking steps in the right direction of systematizing how we set credit limits for our borrowers. Most of our borrowers would like higher credit limits and we’d like to do this for them, but don’t have a safe way to do this without going past our comfort limits when it comes to risk.
One way we could do this is by allowing borrowers to collateralize their loans above the limits that we’re comfortable extending without collateral.
As an example:

BORROWER_1 has a credit limit of $2,000,000. This means that we are okay with extending them a $2,000,000 loan without collateral.
We wouldn’t want to go beyond 2mm without collateral, but we might be willing to go up to 3mm if they were willing to post 5-6mm worth of collateral…

This is a way to scale up growth in a way that we are comfortable with while also giving more utility to TRU and getting our borrowers more involved in the protocol.
How I envision this working:
If a borrower wants to go beyond the unsecured credit limit we assign them, they’d be able to post collateral for the amount above our unsecured limit that would be locked on-chain for the duration of their loan.
Example Tiers (numbers below are examples for the purpose of explanation):
If a borrower stakes:

250,000 - 1,000,000 TRU: Can borrow up to an additional 500,000 at 50% LTV.
1,000,000 - 5,000,000 TRU: Can borrow up to an additional $2,500,000 at 50% LTV and receive 1% discount on rates
5,000,000 - 10,000,000 TRU: Can borrow up to an additional $5,000,000 at 50% LTV and receive 1.5% discount on rates
'>10,000,000 TRU: Can borrow up to an additional $10,000,000 at 50% LTV and receive 2% discount on rates

In the above example, even if the borrower did not want to borrow more at the 50% LTV, they’d still be able to have the discount on rates. E.g., if BORROWER_2 has a 10mm unsecured credit limit and only needed to borrow 10mm then they could still have the 2% discount on their unsecured amount if they were staking >10mm TRU.
I don’t believe this at all takes away from the value of unsecured lending (we are very much still doing that), but now we’re expanding our offerings to be able to more scalable grow our borrower pool.

If this leads to a higher TRU price, then it means better lending APY, better default protection and hence more lenders. This can also encourage more people to stake which again leads to more default protection.

I’ll make some updates to the post so that this is better reflected.

In either case, it creates a spike in demand for the token at some given point ( right before submitting proposal vs. payment date approaching ). In a scenario where there is limited liquidity, this creates ridiculous volatility that undermines the credibility of the protocol rather than the healthy appreciation desired. It also requires the protocol to pump liquidity into the system to maintain some sort of normal functionality. The price appreciation evaporate as soon as the liquidity is absorbed and the demand returns to normal. In the end, it’s difficult to quantify what was actually achieved.

dydx Liquidity Provider
We have been working with the dydx team, providing liquidity one their L2 perpetual markets since they launched in April 2021. We finished Epoch 0 as the first Market Makers by Liquidity Rewards, in front of Wintermute or Amber Group. We captured ~1.4B (~15% of the total) of maker volume on Epoch 0, and we are currently standing at ~17% on Epoch 1.
dydx Approved Borrower
We are on the list of dydx’s initial list of Approved Borrowers. This allows us to borrow up to 20% of the ~120M USDC deposited in the Liquidity Pool.
BORROW REQUEST
Request
An initial loan of 500,000 USD.
Usage of the funds
The dydx loan will allow us to 2x our trading capital. However we won’t be able to withdraw the funds from dydx, and since our main market making strategy in that venue is fully hedged, we also require capital for the cover exchange. This is where the TrueFi loan comes in.
Risk Management
Since our positions are always hedged, we are not exposed to market risk. When it comes to leverage we usually stay below 2x, and never go over 3x on any exchange.
Almost all our capital is deposited in exchanges, so we are exposed to counterparty risk. That’s why we chose our trading venues carefully and never deposit our own capital in exchanges that don’t have a proven track record.

['Proposal to integrate Footprint Data Analytics with TrueFi'],"Summary
Footprint is a powerful yet easy-to-use analytics tool to uncover and visualize blockchain data
The team consists of an experienced team of DeFi enthusiasts with diverse backgrounds, including smart contract developers, consumer internet product designers, investment managers from the banking industry, and risk modeling practitioners
Footprint is committed to transforming data and information into actionable insights, to find value in every movement
Proposal

This proposal advocates for providing a real-time dashboard on TrueFi
This proposal advocates for recommending TrueFi users trying to create dashboards and queries, to develop analytical thinking, and discuss the platform development scientifically

At first, Footprint will provide a real-time dashboard for TrueFi users. Not in a normal way relying on API only, using Bitquery and Airflow, Footprint built three commonly used modules, through conducting protocol-decoding and figuring out input and output of each pool, and analyze events behind pools. Footprint can provide automated, intelligent data integrity & data quality verification mechanisms. The system can automatically check the data before data entry, timely warning, and automatic repair
Then, Footprint will be a tool that existing TrueFi users can use. TrueFi users build out their own dashboards and intensify interest and loyalty towards DeFi and TrueFi
Reason
Users can understand and analyze the real-time data of TrueFi and build confidence in the TrueFi ecosystem
Footprint can help members of the TrueFi community to promote their analytical thinking and properly distribute their assets
Analyze Pool reports to obtain deeper insight data, optimize DAO’s investment management strategy, and maximize the return of the platform’s investment strategy
Result
Footprint provides customized dashboards to promote the development of the TrueFi ecosystem and serve users
Everyone can be a project analyst and contribute insights to TrueFi and DeFi industry

Background
Keeping with the cadence started on June 15, we’d like to reevaluate the LP TRU incentives every two weeks to (1) gradually decrease emissions over time and (2) target utilizations near 60-70% for each pool.
Motivation

Recent community sentiment has supported lower TRU reward emissions to lenders
TrueFi originated >$200M in new loans during August, creating significant protocol value from recent capital inflows.
While utilization rates remain low (33%), this proposal aims to reduce rates incrementally so as to bring utilization near target (60-70%) while also maintaining larger pool sizes that enable TrueFi’s growth.

tfUSDC (~30%) well below target utilization
tfTUSD (~30%) well below target utilization

['[IDEA] Reimburse stakers if possible when defaults are recovered'],"Authors: @nsoman AKA @soaringdove in Discord, or Nick Soman in real life.
Summary
When defaulted loans are fully or partially recovered, reimburse stakers, not just lenders and the SAFU.
Current system:

When a default happens, stakers lose 10% of their stake (value transfer to lenders).
If defaulted loans are recovered, lenders are made whole first.
ALL excess is kept by the DAO/SAFU to compensate it for handling the default process.

Stakers have no way to get any of their slashed stake, even if all money is recovered. This means a successfully recovered default is a money transfer from stakers to DAO/SAFU - regardless of the amount, or time spent.
Proposed system:

When a default happens, stakers lose 10% of their stake (value transfer to lenders).
If defaulted loans are recovered, lenders are made whole first.
SOME excess is kept by the DAO/SAFU to compensate it for handling the default process (to cover all money and time spent).
Remaining excess is redistributed to stakers.

Motivation
The TrueFi model relies on stakers. I’m operating on the assumption that these are big entities and defaults have a >50% chance of being recovered. The current system punishes stakers for staking even when defaulted loans are recovered, and there is a significant risk that they will stop staking.

['[IDEA] Reimburse stakers if possible when defaults are recovered'],Agreed with this idea.,18,3.6,2021-09-02
['[IDEA] Reimburse stakers if possible when defaults are recovered'],"Hi @nsoman thanks for your post. Before addressing your proposal I think it is worth pointing out a few things about the way the current default system works that do not seem clear from your post. I have numbered my thoughts to align with the numbers in your post as best as I can.


The current system doesn’t automatically cause stakers to lose 10% of their stake if there is a default. It can slash UP TO 10%. This is a key point. If the value of the staked TRU on the system is $100 million, the maximum slash to stakers is 10% or $10 million. But if the defaulted loan is only for $5 million, the full 10% slash won’t happen. Likewise, if the defaulted loan is for $20 million the most the stakers can lose is still $10 million. This is a capped downside risk. I think when considering the value that stakers are getting for their staking activity it is important to recognize they are getting this capped downside risk while still participating in both the TRU rewards for staking, a percentage of the successful loan interest payments, and platform governance. Compared to a similar structured finance transaction in “trad fi” this is a much better deal. So to give up a portion of potential default recovery isn’t that big an ask (which I expand upon below);


If a loan defaults, the SAFU makes the lenders whole and also collects the slashed TRU from stakers. This activity acts as an internal bank insurance program to give the stablecoin lenders confidence to provide liquidity. It is necessary to attract the lenders. The other benefit of the SAFU managing this process is that rather than immediately slashing and selling TRU from stakers, and pushing the prices lower by dumping on the market, is that the SAFU can make lenders whole from reserves and manage the sale of TRU over time to protect the value of the stakers “un-slashed” TRU;


/4. - The point about “excess” recovery really needs to be explored. The TrueFI protocol is an uncollateralized protocol, meaning that if there is a default there is nothing to sell to immediately recover losses. Instead, the DAO and SAFU would work together to bring a legal action to collect the defaulted amount. I would recommend everyone reading this spend some time researching how uncollateralized debts are collected in “trad fi” because even though we are dealing in defi the same universal truths apply. Primarily, the likelihood of recovering 100% of an uncollateralized debt through legal action is almost zero. If the borrower has some funds to pay back the defaulted loan and agrees to a workout with creditors it is most likely that the DAO/SAFU is one of many creditors that will be standing in line to be paid. In a best case let us assume that the defaulting party pays creditors $0.80 on the $1 owed. This is a highly unlikely outcome but maybe it happens. That still leaves a 20% gap that the DAO/SAFU has to make up, before legal and administrative fees, just to get back to even after making the TrueFi lenders whole. The amount, if any, recovered is even less if the defaulter claims bankruptcy protection. There is no excess. The chances that there will ever be an excess recovered is so slim that voting on which party would have “first claim” to a theoretical excess is fine but ultimately pointless. And, I would say propose the staker’s capped downside risk, and the freedom from the administrative duties of actually collecting the debt justify giving this theoretical excess to the DAO/SAFU.


So while I understand your motivation, I think it lacks certain realities. Even if chances of some recovery is as you say “>50%” that is different than saying it will be a full recovery, inclusive of legal and administrative costs. Rather than punishing stakers, the current system caps their downside risk and allows them to vote on the terms of credit portfolio they are staking on. In return it asks stakers to be active participants. I have no problem if you want to have a vote but I think it would make sense to recognize the chances of an “excess” recovery are virtually nil.",17,68.4,2021-09-02
['[IDEA] Reimburse stakers if possible when defaults are recovered'],Keep system as is given the discussion points  after the initial post.,13,2.6,2021-09-03
['[IDEA] Reimburse stakers if possible when defaults are recovered'],"Thanks @tim.welsh. I appreciate this thoughtful response. I still think we should change the system, and hope to use an example to illustrate why.


You’re right, I should have written “up to 10%” and that is an important point.


Agreed, and I don’t think we should change any of this.


I agree that the point about “excess” should be explored. Let’s use the real world example of a defaulting $19MM loan.


The DAO/SAFU is currently seeded with 5MM TRU (~$3MM). I’m assuming that gets paid out to lenders first, and they are still owed $16MM.  Right now there is $161MM TRU staked in the system, so a 10% slash to stakers on default would cover the remaining $16 MM lost. Lenders would be fully reimbursed immediately.
Now let’s say that in the future 80% of the $19MM loan is recovered (~$15MM). Lenders have already been fully reimbursed. As I understand the current system, 100% of that $15MM would go to the DAO/SAFU. I am proposing that we change this. It certainly makes sense that the DAO/SAFU should be reimbursed for money and time spent to recover the funds. They should also get first claim on restocking their seed money, assuming that is paid out to lenders first. But if the DAO/SAFU spent $1MM on recovery, they should get $1MM + $3MM for seed $ = $4MM of the recovered funds, and the other $11MM should go to the stakers. It won’t fully reimburse them - they’ll still be out $5MM - but it will not enrich the DAO/SAFU at their expense.
I welcome further conversation on this. Please let me know if I’m missing something important above.",13,12.6,2021-09-03
['[IDEA] Reimburse stakers if possible when defaults are recovered'],"Again I understand your point and appreciate the illustration. I think what you were originally talking about isn’t correctly termed “excess.” That was the point that I was originally reacting to; that in almost every scenario, even if a recovery is made by the DAO/SAFU there will be a deficit between what the SAFT paid out and what was collected.
I believe you want to talk about what to do with an amount of money that may be recovered over and above the value of the liquidated balance of the SAFU at the time of the default and the legal administrative costs (~$3MM and $1MM in your example). Let us agree to call the original SAFU balance and the legal costs the “Net Costs” and any amounts recovered above those two amounts the “Net Recovery” (in your illustration, it would be $11MM). If participants in the DAO’s governance want to vote to send that back to TRU stakers they have that option. It can be proposed and voted on at any time.
Even though DAO governance could vote to return any theoretical amounts of the Net Recovery to TRU stakers, here is why they shouldn’t vote to do that - diversification of the insurance pool.
As your illustration outlines, if the SAFU sells the original seed assets and immediately dumps ~$16MM  TRU on the market, the price of TRU will immediately plummet given today’s liquidity. As the recovery plays out, even assuming the recovery rates in your illustration, the platform will issue more loans that don’t default, and hopefully, the price of TRU rebounds. The smarter thing for the SAFU to do with the ~$11MM Net Recovery would be to restock the SAFU’s asset buffer with non-TRU and uncorrelated assets, and to manage an insurance portfolio that can grow over time and lower the chance of needing to slash stakers in the case of a second default. That is what would have the most overall benefit to the platform and to holders of TRU (both stakers and non-stakers). Sending the Net Recovery to the individual stakers who were slashed during the first default encourages a death spiral for the platform. Instead of growing a reserve in the SAFU and lowering the chance of needing to perform a 10% slash in the future, it keeps leaving the SAFU at a bare minimum level. This would mean each successive default will likely require another slash. That hurts stakers over time and they will unstake. It hurts the price of TRU over time as it continues to need to be dumped on the market. And it hurts the platform as a whole because it has a lower and lower balance of reserves to pay liquidity providers in the case of a default. If this was put to a vote, I would encourage a vote against it.
(An aside - I think an 80% recovery estimate is wildly optimistic and not correlated to recovery rates in real legal action by an unsecured creditor, which is where the recovery will take place, the real world court system. I would highly recommend everyone do their own research into the recovery rates of unsecured creditors who bring legal actions. Based on my experience it is much more likely that the DAO wouldn’t recover the original balance and legal fees, i.e., it would recover less than $4MM in your illustration.)",13,7.6,2021-09-03
['[IDEA] Reimburse stakers if possible when defaults are recovered'],"Thanks @tim.welsh. I appreciate your thinking and I believe we’ve clarified where we disagree.
We are talking about a scenario in which a loan defaults, all lenders have been fully reimbursed, and later a recovery is made over and above the value of the liquidated balance of the SAFU at the time of the default and the legal administrative costs.
I think some or all of the incremental dollars should be returned to stakers who lost their money on the default, since they were harmed directly by this default.
It sounds like you think all of the incremental dollars should be kept by the DAO/SAFU (which could vote to do anything with them, including reimbursing stakers), in order to reduce the negative impact of future defaults.
There’s a fair amount of systems thinking and assumptions going into both of our recommendations, but I think that’s the crux of our disagreement.
LMK if you think that categorization is incorrect. I’d be curious to hear thoughts from others in the community too.",11,52.2,2021-09-03

['Community forums - Engagement and Interaction'],"Hi, my name is Neal, this is my first post.
I’m a member of a few Defi (Decentralised Finance) forums and wanted to share some data over the last three months of how frequently users visit and how they interact whilst there (ie. create or replies to topics):
The large Defi projects listed here have more than 3,000 registered users, Small Defi projects have less than 400 registered users :

The data shows that the majority of users in large communities are not visiting very frequently and even less are interacting. Whilst the smaller community numbers are better, it is possible that the numbers might go the same way as they continue to grow in size. The question is: why are so many people signing up and tuning out?
Possible reasons
Defi is complex – A lot of the material on forums is difficult for the average person to understand.
A lot of information – Although topics are categorized, it is hard to know where to start and how to gain a good overview of everything going on.
Hard to know what the main objectives are – DAO’s (Decentralised Autonomous Organisations) are a new concept still in its infancy and with the larger forums in particular, it is hard to know what a community is collectively trying to achieve.
I am interested to hear the thoughts of others and have another post to make with some suggestions on how to address the issues mentioned above.
Hope I’ve not overstayed my welcome already!

['Revised Tokenomics and proposed token BURN'],"Hey guys, I have gone through the token distribution document published by the team and wanted to express my thoughts on improving/revising the tokenomics for the long term growth of TrueFi. The goal is to at least reduce the total circulation supply by ~160M TRU (11.11 %) by a token burn.
The post identifies places of possible token burn/re-allocation and logic behind it


docs.google.com



TRU Token Distribution Explanation [Shared]
TRU Token Overview Max supply:  1.44bn Current circulating supply (as of 2/3/21):  151mm  Token allocations: Incentives (yield farming) = 565,500,000 (39%) Pre-Sale = 387,917,402 (26.75%) Team =  268,250,000 (18.5%) Company/Foundation = 163,082,598...





Current Allocations:
1) Incentives : 39% (565 million)
2) Presale : 26.75%
3) Team: 18.5 %
4) Company/Foundation : 11.25%  (163M, 53M unlocked and 110M unloced in next 2 years)
5) Future team: 4.5% (65M)
Proposal:
a) Incentives Pool

Burn UNUSED Balancer pool incentives :  8,912,512 TRU
Burn UNUSED Nexus Mutual pool incentives  1,227,500
Burn UNUSED Uniswap leftover allocation: 53M tokens (due to reduction of Uniswap and then removal of uniswap incentives)

Reduction in supply from BURN ~ 64 Million tokens
b) Company foundation


Burn 35% of company fund (57M TRU)
This leaves company reserves for spending at 70% i.e 106M TRU which is a sizable budget for all company expenses (35.33 million unlocked at each vesting period) and SAFU fund


Re-Allocate 5% of company fund as a Marketing Fund:  (8M TRU)
This is absolutely essential to set a budget aside to exclusively spend on AMA’s, Youtube influencer videos, and directed media marketing using the existing crypto juggernauts. This should only be used for social media and influencer marketing. At present, there is no separate marketing fund for this spending and the creation of one will make the spending expenses on directed influencer marketing transparent. In addition, the community can decide if this amount is to small or too big but having an exclusive marketing fund is vital.


Reduction in supply from BURN ~ 57 Million TRU
Cumulative reduction a+b : 121M TRU
c) Future team
Burn 70% of future team tokens (45M TRU)
These have  been overallocated as mentioned in the document above. Also since TRU is becoming more valuable this will not diminish the USD value of TRU incentives for new team members.  Remaining in pool (20 million TRU)
Reduction in supply ~ 45 M TRU
Cumulative reduction a+b+c : 166M TRU
These are some numbers I have crunched to reduce the token supply without affecting the incentive pool or affecting the functioning of the company. With the token unlock coming every 3 months, this is going to help greatly in reducing the supply of TRU by a sizable amount immediately.

['Revised Tokenomics and proposed token BURN'],"This is some amazing detailed proposal @spidey Thank you for this.
I have a high level question regarding this. Why can’t we initially put this into a temporary SAFU fund until we have a proper SAFU fund initiated through some options we discussed at Secure Asset Fund for Lenders (Similar to SAFU)
I’m trying to see if we can hit two birds in one stone. Once we have a proper SAFU setup, these token in the temp SAFU can be burned. The only advantage I see burning right away vs putting it in a temp SAFU is the optics.
If tokenomics are super important to onboard new comers and influencers, then I’m fully onboard even without any temp SAFU.
I don’t have a strong opinion with one vs the other. Overall I’m in supportive of this token burn.",69,48.8,2021-02-12
['Revised Tokenomics and proposed token BURN'],"I support this 100%.   From my perspective  and experience in crypto recently, coming back to the industry as a sell-side crypto analyst:


I’ve pitched the TRU coin to 2 sell-side crytpo analysts and I know @JupiterCapital has as well.  The tokenomics need to be fixed , this and the resulting valuation were a major concern.  Basically institutions won’t buy this coin and the sell-side can’t recommend it to them in the 1st place until we fix these legacy issues and small tokenomics fixes aren’t good enough. Let’s fix this once and for good.


the Marketing fund is pure genius and every other major coin out there has this allocation.  In 2018 when it was ICO time we didn’t need this but times have changed.  I am personal friends with the head of a $100mm crypto VC and have learned how they do things.  Projects like PAID, RUNE, PUNDI, 1INCH, have all been taken to market via “influencers”.   The influencers are given allocation of the ICO and /or coin on an ongoing basis to do write-ups on Twitter and YouTube and the like.   We want to work with the top 10 influencers who have worked with major projects, like Cardano and the ones above and these guys need to be paid well and quarterly.  These influencers have basically created the entire user base and valuation for these coins, allowing the mgmt teams to then take the wheel and steer the company to the moon without having to focus on the coin price much.   PAID has already done 100x to its investors , RUNE 70x, PUNDI 50X, 1INCH 40X .   So it’s time we get up to date with 2021 marketing and get this approved.


I support creating a general marketing fund like Spidey has done b/c I want to get 1) management buy-in 2) not focus on promoting the coin but rather on growing the project as a whole 3) allowing enough wiggle room (let’s not be cheap) to allow management to make the correct decisions: (i…e. let them build a superior product but have the allocation ready to market the heck out of it (influencers, press releases, youtube, whatever they need, here is their fuel)
Great work @spidey and thanks for your hard work and commitment.   We have amazing momentum and teamwork (and management buy -in I think).  Let’s increase our TVL to well past $100mm and gain the attention of major borrowers like Yearn Finance, and take TRU to $5+",68,48.6,2021-02-12
['Revised Tokenomics and proposed token BURN'],"Agree 100% with point #1. I do think additional burns of company tokens would make sense, the “tokenomics debt” of our legacy structure is clear to me as well.
Iffy on #2 in the way that you present it in here, while I am fully aware of the projects you’ve cited, their methods, and performance… I’m not sure PAID is the token we want to aspire to… something tells me that one doesn’t end well.
RUNE is ANON, 1inch and PUNDI are not US based teams to the best of my knowledge. 1inch for as great as it is, isn’t listed on DeFipulse and has poor relations with the rest of the larger DeFi projects in the west (not discounting the team at all, I hold a bag).
I want TRU price to go up, as a reflection of the work the team/community is doing together.  A lot of 2017 coins like Cardano/XRP have predatory marketing aimed at retail noobs that just end up as someone else’s exit liquidity. Personally, I wouldn’t want TrueFi to be associated in the same realm as Cardano or similar projects. Numbah go up is important but at what cost?
Overall, I agree some tokens should be converted for marketing fund, just can’t endorse the examples you outlined.",58,76.6,2021-02-12
['Revised Tokenomics and proposed token BURN'],"@spidey thanks for putting this together to start on a much needed conversation / proposal.
Team. I have personally pitched TRU and while the overall sentiment of the project / protocol is amazing, the tokenomics is a concern. This has also been said via twitter posts as well.
Why let this go on any longer and risk losing the solid momentum and community that has been built thusfar.
I support every measure Spidey has put forth. Let’s get this to vote and fix this asap in order to move forward. 2017 ICO tokenomics wont work in this environment and we can really push TRU to new heights.",53,25.6,2021-02-12
['Revised Tokenomics and proposed token BURN'],"@Jacks my idea behind marketing fund is to make allocation for marketing/amas, youtube influencers transparent. It’s a hard truth that marketing goes a long way in adoption and I am proposing having a transparent allocation reserved for this purpose.  As for examples, I agree they don’t matter as our philosophy is different from them but the end goal of adoption is the same.
What are your thoughts regarding the tokenburns proposed? Removing 161M out of supply without affecting the TrueFi ecosystem is absolutely vital to instill confidence is new users as well as institutions looking to adopt TrueFi! I would appreciate other team members to chime in as well. @MG-TT @ryan.rodenbaugh @rafaelcosman

['Revised Tokenomics and proposed token BURN'],"haha, sorry to laugh but you are correct in that those weren’t the best examples.  The point is they are ones that had good marketing budgets with influencer allocation.  Now while we can claim 1inch doesn’t have great  relations with other companies in the industry, TRU has had 4 years to create great relations,  and, for what?   We’re struggling to hold a spot on DeFi pulse 1inch just did $12 billion in volume last month and became the #1 DEX aggregator in the world and returned 40x for its investors ,  we want to give you, the team, a marketing/influencer budget as opposed to no allocation , which is what we have now.   From what I learned 1inch, for example, used influencers, not only to increase their coin price, but also to increase product awareness use of their platform some 100x.  The proposal aims to give management that budget and ability to do . Let’s remember that some (very few) of these influencers are first and foremost proponents of blockchain and the crypto ecosystem and they would love to work with companies such as ours that add serious value to society.  Candidly I’ve discussed this with @MG-TT   I believe he understands this area well.  He asks the right questions and understands the benefits and drawbacks well.  He has legacy crypto experience and now is up-to-speed on current expectations and risks of influencer use so I don’t think he will steer you wrong with regards to use of this budget.  I am always here to give him feedback given my experience taking 2 startups to the 8 figure revenue level using grassroots marketing efforts and my experience as a scrutinizing sell-side research analyst.",51,70.2,2021-02-13
['Revised Tokenomics and proposed token BURN'],"I have been on the discord server since launch,  and followed the developments of the product and feedback from the community very closely.  The product is evolving nicely, and the v2 changes will be a massive step forward - and “fix” many of the issues I have personally experienced and reported.
There has been regular and consistent feedback regarding both marketing and tokenomics from people that are looking this from an investors perspective. Although marketing strategy and execution is subjective, I will always support more funds being made available to marketing. Marketing is the fuel to take this product where we all want to see it. Therefore I agree with allocating more TRU to marketing - and to keep this money ringfenced.
The second point is regarding the tokenomics. Now this is not an area I have much experience in - so I have to take council from the people that do (the people on the front line that are talking to inventors and pitching TRU and TrueFi). From what I am hearing, the tokenomics are based on what was appropriate/standard a couple of years ago. Things have moved on quickly, so we need to adjust appropriately.

['Revised Tokenomics and proposed token BURN'],"I think this is a good post, but also a bit shortsighted. Let me explain my thinking
1
I agree that the original token distribution PROBABLY overallocated to (a) future team (b) company and maybe to incentives (more on incentives later).
I also agree that the total supply is a legacy #. Fewer projects launching today have so many tokens outstanding. I think the only one that’s close is Uniswap which has 1bn tokens and after y4 plans to introduce 2% annual inflation.
2
On the incentives: I am opposed to burning the leftover Balancer, Nexus Mutual, and Uniswap tokens. Those pools were created to incentivize people to join the TrueFi community and decentralize ownership of the protocol. Burning those tokens would directly opposed to those goals of decreasing centralization of the protocol. It would only be to the benefit of existing token holders (of which you all are). I can’t fault you for wanting that outcome, but at this time, I don’t believe it’s best for the long-term growth of TrueFi. At a later date, it could be decided that burning those tokens would be the best decision, but I believe it’s too early to make a decision on that. From the Google Doc linked in the original post, it provides a ton of nuanced detail (more than most other token distributions I’ve read) and I believe people who read that will be satisfied with the state of the unallocated incentive pools. If they’re token holders, they’ll be able to vote on the best new ways to use those tokens to grow TrueFi.
3
Future Team Tokens: Same setup as incentive tokens. I’m opposed to burning these right now. I already said in the Google Doc above that while yes, this category was probably overallocated to, nothing has changed between when I typed the google doc and now to confirm that this has been overallocated to. While these tokens do count against the total supply, they have no impact on circulating supply right now and anyone who reads the Google Doc (which will soon be a medium post) can clearly see that.
4
Company tokens:  I think this is the category that could be adjusted now and as I said on the SAFU thread, I’m working on it. I’ve been working on it nearly every day for the past week including today (Sunday) and yesterday. It’s extremely top of mind.",51,195.2,2021-02-14
['Revised Tokenomics and proposed token BURN'],"Thanks @ryan.rodenbaugh. I appreciate your comments and as I mentioned my post was just based on some number crunching I did myself to figure out what % of token-supply can be reduced without affecting company operation and at the same time increasing the investment value for TrueFi from a tokenomics perspective. I want to still strongly emphasize that a tokenmics model which significantly reduces or locks away the current share of Un-released tokens is absolutely essential for the longterm growth of TrueFi.


The current token model is definitely a legacy model, so I am glad  you agree it needs retweaking to be attractive in the current market. I look forward to your comments and how you incorporate our feedback.


Community incentives need not be burned, I was just trying to find ways to reduce supply. A better way would be to use these based on community feedback. Also any unallocated community incentives should definitely not be reduced at all.


As for future team and company tokens, I commented on the SAFU post (Secure Asset Fund for Lenders (Similar to SAFU)) that if we allocated > 70% to the SAFU fund, I have no issues with these tokens being NOT BURNED, as they are still being used for insuring the current users and also locking away the TRU in a way. I was unsure of how much progress had been made from team’s end with regards to SAFU, and hence suggested to burn these instead, but I will not be opposed to using these for SAFU operations. Please keep in mind that this needs to be a significant chuck to make a dent in the SAFU fund.


Finally, I thank the team for considering the community feedback, but have to again insist that we need to bring the total token supply by a lot (atleast by 200-300 million), to make TrueFi attractive to incoming investors/users and reduce the sell pressure from newly released tokens.
I look forward to your post ryan ",43,43.6,2021-02-20
['Revised Tokenomics and proposed token BURN'],"I’m currently opposed to pretty much all burns. I see them as a short-term optimization at the expense of later growth. I think a better use for unallocated incentives is to allocate them as incentives in the more distant future - I think even a very small farming reward going on for several years would be valuable in helping us keep our edge over other DeFi projects. I also think that burns have an undesirable centralizing effect, placing more of the market cap in the hands of current holders rather than allowing more new people to earn those tokens and join the community.",40,28.0,2021-03-29

['Creation of Community-Managed TRU Telegram Group'],"Hi everyone,
Per my conversation with multiple members of  the community I am creating a proposal for the re-creation of a Public TrueFi (TRU) Telegram group.  This will be different and, exist concurrently, with the Discord group.  In the past we’ve avoided doing so b/c we wanted to avoid negativity and confusion with the TrueUSD group but things are different now: We are now trading on Binance and have a strong community.  The market is hot, now is the time.  The features of this Telegram group include
*Will be a “Public” group essentially managed by the community and for the community about the TRU coin
*Will focus on the TRU coin’s investing / trading, and other general topics NOT on how to use the TrueFi lending platform, governance proposals or anything that is already discussed in Discord in great detail
*Management will NOT be an active member of this group.  We do not want to distract them. Management will continue to be active in the Discord community that has evolved to generate significant activist-investor-generate ideas and governance proposals
*We recommend the hiring of a community manager who can clarify questions, ban users if needed, and implement community infrastructure such as automated messages
The reasons we, as the TRU stakeholders, want to create this community are that

The Discord community is too small and Discord is used by a very small % of crypto investors (about 10 %) whereas Telegram is used by over 75% of crypto investors.
There is no existing easily accessible, commonly-used medium through which TRU stakeholders can talk.  This is limiting community involvement.
It is limiting:
a) the # of wallet-holders and # of stakeholders
b) our word-of-mouth growth of the TrueFi lending platform
c) word-of-mouth growth of the Total Value Locked in the various Pools
d) Buzz around the company and street about the company and TRU coin
e) Price action and Volume on the TRU coin

We have examined over 20 similar projects that were able to use their Telegram community to grow from a sub $.10 coin price to several dollars.  These projects were able to speed up use of their platform, grow revenue, and receive major media coverage.  It seems Telegram usage has matured in the past year to allow for this and is different than before.  We believe that the creation of this group will also result in:

Thousands more Twitter followers-something that will snowball and reduce the management time of marketing:  allowing the company to use Twitter more effectively
Many more TradingView write-ups resulting in more institutional buyers of the coin and also more Loan requests on the platform from institutional trading firms
More media coverage from publications and research analysts such as Unchained, Messari research, and even some free influencer write-ups

As a last note, we would like to keep Discord as an actively-managed channel for high-level community and management involvement.   We feel the addition of newbie investors/traders into Discord is distracting and overwhelms the channel with talk about price, trading, and simply, complaints which are distracting to mgmt.  This causes it to appear as a negative environment and sends the wrong message to potential investors in TRU.   A Telegram TRU community should not be heavily censored but, rather, allow price and trading talk, memes, and be fun and full of energy for the investing public.

The truth is this: we’d love to have an official Telegram group from a marketing perspective but (a) having to orient two distinct communities around Q&A, governance, etc AND demand they cross-pollinate their best ideas is a certain kind of nightmare and (b) using core team to manage the volume of conversations on Telegram is not the best use of existing resources.

['Community forums - Some suggestions'],"Identification System for Proposals
As more and more proposals are put forward by community members, it will become increasingly harder to keep track of them. A simple identification system might be useful going forward.
For example :

Proposal Tracker
This new Identification system could form the basis of an up-to-date document (perhaps pinned at the top of the Proposals category) that shows the current status of all the proposals put forward. If maintained, it would give the community a clear picture of where things are and in the years to come, it would be an accurate record of everything put forward, whether implemented or not.
For example (feel free to suggest other columns, this is just a general idea)  :

Weekly Bulletin
A weekly bulletin would give community members an idea of what has happened in the last week.
The topics that have had the most interaction (say three or four were picked out each week) could be summarised, to give community members an idea of what is being talked about and trending in the community. These bulletins could serve as a weekly record and members who only drop in once a month could read the last few weeks and feel up to date.
This might be better as a monthly bulletin and I am happy to put my writing skills to use if the idea has support.
Community Objectives
This one might take a bit of work but could be worth it in the long run.
Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO’s) are a new concept and this form of Governance through a community forum is still finding its way but if a set of objectives could be agreed upon, this would give a clear direction of what the community is striving to achieve.
For example:

Generating revenue.
Growing the community.
Collaborating with other protocols

These objectives might change over time but having something to aim for might provide some guidance heading forward.",11,72.2,2021-08-17
['[Ideas] Change Lender Incentive Payouts'],"Authors: @ryan.rodenbaugh @tylerw @hal @RDharia @MG-TT

Background:
As the community has been discussing tokenomics in a few posts now (1, 2, 3) and for the past two months we have made bi-weekly adjustments of lender incentives.
One thing that has not been formally discussed is either (1) vesting on TRU incentives for lenders or (2) paying out lender incentives in stkTRU instead of TRU.
We can discuss both, but for the purpose of this proposal, I will talk about paying in stkTRU.

Proposal:


Pay LP incentives in stkTRU (by default, this means rewards would be locked for at least 14 days)
Increase the fee that stakers receive from 10% → 15% or 20%
Consider increasing the $TRU incentives paid to stakers if the interest rate becomes unappealing


Points for Discussion:

From the perspective of a lender:

Con: lower liquidity, as stkTRU comes with 14d lockup
Con: higher risk, exposure to 10% liquidations from default slashing on stkTRU
Con: higher friction, more steps to capturing upside of lending
Pro: passive new earning upside, in the form of TRU farm & protocol fees (10% now and we can vote this higher)
Pro: growing default protection, as lenders will now contribute to stkTRU default assurance pool as they loan
Pro: lender involvement in borrower selection, as lenders now get governance tokens used directly in approval of new loans/borrowers

From protocol/TRU holder perspective:

Pro: locked liquidity + deeper incentive alignment between lenders & stakers grows the quality of loans and borrowers and designs for long-term investing in TrueFi.
Pro: Less mercenary farming where lenders are just there to farm and dump
Con: Could lead to short-term TVL decrease if most lenders are not in favor of the change

['[Ideas] Change Lender Incentive Payouts'],"I’m in favor of paying rewards in stkTRU.
I’m not sure if increasing the interest earned to stakers makes sense. I think this kind of change is a separate issue from using stkTRU to pay stakers. If we increase % fees paid to TRU stakers, I would support at maximum 12.5%. In order to be competitive as a lending product, we need to make sure lenders are getting the best rates for zero-collateral loans as possible. Through decreasing the base rate lenders receive, we are creating a worse product.
Instead of increasing the amount of interest given to TRU stakers, we should implement more creative ways to increase the utility and value of the TRU token.",28,90.6,2021-08-13

Max across both 0% - 20%

I agree with Hal that we should ensure the lending product is competitive. For the intermediate term, I propose keeping the 90/10 split and directing all of the current 10% from TRU stakers to build up the treasury funds and remove slashing from TRU stakers.

Summary
Decrease total LP emissions by ~5% from 350,000 TRU/day to 330,000 TRU/day.

Decrease tfTUSD by 10,000 TRU/day to 45,000 TRU/day
Decrease tfUSDC by 10,000 TRU/day to 185,000 TRU/day
​​No change to tfUSDT; emissions remain at 100,000 TRU/day

These changes will go into effect around 11:00 am PST on Thursday August 12, 2021
Background
Keeping with the cadence started on June 15, we’d like to reevaluate the LP TRU incentives every two weeks to (1) try and gradually decrease emission over time (2) target utilizations near 60-70% for each pool.
Motivation

Recent community sentiment has supported lower TRU reward emissions to lenders
TrueFi generated >$130M in new loans over the past 7 days, creating significant protocol value from recent capital inflows.
While utilization rates are currently very low (32%), this proposal aims to reduce rates incrementally so as to bring utilization near target (60-70%) while also maintaining larger pool sizes that enable TrueFi’s growth.

tfTUSD (20%) is well below target utilization → decrease tfTUSD incentives
tfUSDC (30%) is well below target utilization → decrease tfUSDC incentives
tfUSDT (45%) is near target utilization → leave as is


Interest rates across DeFi stablecoin markets remain low
Adjusting emissions gradually based upon utilization rates help us test and build a sustainable, long-term model for TrueFi lender incentives

"['TrueFi Marketing Bounty Program, “Refer for Rewards”']","Background
Since our last community town hall meeting on 6/2, after @leecrowhurst  and @MG-TT  suggested building a TrueFi media buying committee, we’ve been exploring successful incentivized community engagement programs - often called bounty programs - and strategizing how to adapt the best case studies into something that’d work for TrueFi’s unique needs.
Authors: @AdaW @MG-TT
Summary: This proposal develops a way to incentive community-driven marketing via TRU rewards from the treasury.
The objective is to (a) grow TrueFi’s current network & reach through social media influencers, writers, artists, journalists and podcasters, (b) prototype the first community-driven marketing effort, and (c) reward those participating appropriately in an incentive-aligned way.
In terms of a proposed timeline & budget, we’d expect to run this program as a 3-4 month trial with a 50,000 TRU budget (equivalent to 10-50 reward disbursements, depending on tier), or until the budget is exhausted - whichever comes first.
Adjusting budget after the end of the trial: If the program is successful, the budget will run out before the trial period. The community may then vote to refill the program budget. If the program is largely underutilized and much of the budget remains unspent, the community can vote to reallocate the budget or reclaim it for general treasury use at the end of the trial period.
The “TrueFi Marketing Bounty Committee” - Suggested Makeup
As executing on many of these referrals will demand the active participation of the TrueFi core marketing team, it’s proposed that the committee steering this initiative have at least some TrueFi core marketing team representation, who will serve both as standard committee members and oversee execution on the referral (which may look like slotting time on Rafael’s schedule for a podcast, booking travel for a conference appearance, creating marketing collateral for a PR opportunity, etc).
As it’s a community-funded effort, and as one of the objectives is to introduce more community leadership to TrueFi’s marketing efforts, it’s also important this committee include representatives from outside the TrueFi core team. Ideally these members would (a) be longstanding users of TrueFi, as well as current TRU holders, (b) have at least nominal expertise in marketing/PR/social media, and (c) be endorsed by the broader TRU community.
The function of the committee is: vetting incoming opportunities, choosing the tier of awards, and paying out successful referrers.
Proposed team structure: to start the conversation, we propose a committee of 6, composed of 3 TrueFi core marketing team members and 3 TrueFi community members endorsed by TRU holders. The committee would require a majority to approve any activity, not full consensus. Any member inactive for 30 days or ineffective (as deemed by committee vote) may be removed from the committee, with the intention that the member be replaced by a person of the same type (i.e. core team or community member).
We encourage you to share any other effective structure to run the program in comments!
Whitelisted Functions Rewarded by the Bounty Committee:
As it stands, it’s the authors’ opinion that the highest ROI marketing activities that can benefit from the widest possible community involvement are largely (a) warm introductions to credible folks with a large, relevant audience and (b) the creation of original educational content on TrueFi. The list below attempts to categorize and qualify each of these activities:

bountyproposal1404×909 85.8 KB

If it’s not obvious, any referring party must be a relevant, warm intro: the referral should fall under one of the above categories, and the referred party should both roughly understand TrueFi & have an intention to work with the project. No duplicate entries, please.
If this program is approved, we’ll accept referrals via Typeform (a survey platform), and then reach out to the referrer via Telegram and/or email.
Reward Tiers: After a referral is approved and executed, the Bounty Committee will rank the value of the resulting deliverable on a 1-3 scale, with 1000-5000 TRU up for grabs (again, these are proposed reward tiers). A sample tiering system, subject to the discretion of the Bounty Committee, is presented below:

bounty rewards1408×607 50.1 KB

These prizes can be adjusted by the committee, especially as TRU price changes, with 7-day advanced notice by the committee on the forum.
Discussion
This idea will progress in three steps: overall idea & budget approval, then committee selection, and finally, approval of reward types and grant sizes. We’ll discuss it for 3-7 days.
To approve the idea and budget: Does the TRU community approve of this test timeline (3-4 months) and budget (50,000 TRU), and the overall plan for distributing these rewards? It’s at this point we’ll likely move to a Snapshot vote.
Then, to approve the committee makeup, we’ll want to look for good candidates to participate now. Your endorsements of relevant community members are hugely valuable for this - or nominate yourself! (Tip: Tag the person with @____ here in the forum).
Finally, the committee will approve what it will award grants to, and how much those grants will be, from their allotted TRU budget.",39,317.8,2021-07-30
"['TrueFi Marketing Bounty Program, “Refer for Rewards”']","Obviously biased as a co-author on this, but broadly speaking, I think it’s vitally important we come up with cool designs to get TRU holders/community members to actively engage in sharing TrueFi. While this particular proposal is still fairly simple, it’s not just intended to achieve its referral goals but to prototype a higher level of community engagement.
In the end, crypto is a word of mouth marketing game: a very high level of trust is necessary to get most folks to make a financial decision (ie buying a token, lending to a pool), and the TrueFi community is the strongest WoM tool we have. This proposal aims to direct, organize, and reward the enthusiasm of TRU holders into the most impactful activities for the protocol’s growth - but it’s just the start.
It’s my hope this is the first of many initiatives we as a community approve to organize and empower TRU holders to take over the reins of TrueFi marketing over the coming years.

['[Ideas] A Plan for Improved TRU Tokenomics'],"Authors/Contributors: @tylerw @hal Yuchen @ryan.rodenbaugh @MoreNapalm

Background:
Over the last few weeks, it’s been clear that we need to develop a more sustainable, long-term approach to lending pool incentives.

Ryan first posted about this on June 9 (A long-term strategy for lending incentives) that highlighted the fact that we are currently spending way more on lending pool incentives than originally anticipated. TL/DR is that if we stay at the current rate, we’ll run out of TRU lending pool incentives in 9 months, rather than 2-3 years.
This was followed up by a post on June 15 (A Medium-Term strategy for lending pool incentives) which included slightly reducing USDC and USDT from the highest level and severely reducing TUSD while – most importantly – proposing that we adjust rates every two weeks to be more in line with pool utilizations.
Rafael then followed up on June 18 with a post proposing to reduce all farms by 30%. That post had some good back-and-forth, but seems to have landed on the fact that this is not something we want to pursue at this time.
Since then we’ve continued to adjust rates every two weeks and this seems to be working well as a short to medium-term measure.

In the June 9th post, Hal commented about the improved staking gauge and additional ideas around locking TRU to boost lending pool rewards.
This post extends on some of those plans:

Objectives:
Better tokenomics and more long-term alignment between stakeholders


Increase TRU utility + incentives to hold & stake TRU


Improve TrueFi default protection by providing incentives for longer staking periods and higher slashing rates


Create scalable system for distributing lender pool incentives


Spur ecosystem innovation on top of TRU token


Provide stronger incentives to borrow TRU


Create opportunities for Yearn or Convex-like protocols to aggregate lenders and stakers to maximize stkTRU boosts


Our goal is to have this fully specc’d out in the next three weeks so that we can include it in the next smart contract development cycle!

Step 1 (Committed):
Introduce the TrueFi staking gauge in our next big smart contract update. This feature is being audited now.
The details of the staking gauge:

Right now each of our pools has its own smart contract which determines how many TRU will be distributed to that individual pool. In this updated model there will be one staking gauge for all current and future pools.
The gauge will be set to distribute a fixed number of TRU per block and then through ‘allocation points’ or utilization-driven system the gauge will determine how many TRU are distributed to each pool.

We will also scope this distribution model to slowly decrease TRU distributions over time, allowing us to extend the remaining TRU rewards over several years. We encourage you to share details of other projects that have done this well.

Step 2 (The Proposal):
We want to increase the usage for TRU by giving lenders more reasons to own and hold TRU. We have a few proposals for how we could go about this, but are very interested to get feedback and work on this as a community.
We think Curve’s vote locking for higher CRV rewards is a great system that has both created a mini-economy on top of Curve (see yEarn vs Convex wars) and creates additional utility for the token. That said, Curve’s system can be viewed as a bit complex. We want to make TrueFi very accessible to mainstream and TradFi audiences and want to cut out as much complexity as possible. Other projects have adopted Curve’s system with slight edits and that’s what we’d like to do as well.
The core of our proposal comes largely from Badger. We think their “Badger Boost” program comes from the same place our tokenomic revamp is coming from:

Until now, the Badger app hasn’t had mechanics in place to reward those who were long term supporters of the protocol. Instead the largest liquidity providers would earn the most Badger or Digg rewards and in many cases they would sell to realize gains immediately.

Badger aims to improve this by:

Badger Boost enables users to earn more rewards based on the dollar value of Badger or Digg they have staked relative to the dollar value of their Bitcoin deposits in the app. We call this the Badger Ratio and the formula is calculated as follows;


[$ value of BADGER Balance + $ value of DIGG Balance] / [$ Value of non-native staked sett positions].

In the context of TrueFi, this means that the $TRU incentives you receive for lending would be boosted based on the amount of TRU you stake relative to the amount you lend. A proposed formula for TrueFi could be:

[$ value of TRU staked] / [$ value of assets lent across all pools]

As an indicative example (with made up numbers), let’s say:

Ryan had 10,000,000 USDC and 1,00,000 USD worth of stkTRU
Tyler had 1,000,000 USDC and 500,000 USD worth of stkTRU

In this example, Tyler would have a higher boost than Ryan because (500k/1mm) > (1mm/10mm). Ryan would likely still receive more TRU since he’s lending 10x as much as Tyler, but Tyler would receive a higher ROI relative to the amount of capital he’s lending.

Open Questions:

What is the exact formula we want to use to calculate the boosts?
Do we allow users to lock their stake for longer periods of time (> 14 days)?

If yes, how does this work into the boost formula?
The veCRV model incentivizes longer staking and allows users to lock tokens from 1 week for up to 4 years.


Should we allow users to volunteer to accept higher or lower slashing rates?

If yes, how does this work into the boost formula?
We could use something like [$ value of slashable TRU] / [$ value of assets lent across all pools] to incentive higher slashing rates


If desired, how should we implement a voting weight determined by three variables: (i) # of TRU staked, (ii) slashing %, and (iii) staking period?

Are there models we can look to as good examples?
Models like veCRV only use two variables: staking period and amount staked


Should we incentivize lenders to lockup funds in lending pools for longer periods of time (30/60/180 days)?

Such a mechanism could help visibility into future lending capacity and utilization


Should these boost apply across all pools or should they somehow be pool by pool?

To re-iterate, this is good @ryan.rodenbaugh  but I still don’t see any word on the token burn or lock for unwanted tokens which are already circulating. The reason why its different for us compared to CRV, CREAM is we already have a surplus of tokens in circulation. CRV has massive TVL and the token release was gradual as TVL jumped up and the token lock was organically introduced to begin with. Cream has a very small token supply and hence this strategy will allow IceCream to boost cream.  For us, due to any concrete plan for a token burn, Price is at presale level already due to this excess emission and already surplus supply of tokens. Hence, unless there is a strategy to burn a chunk of circulating tokens just trying to fix the future emission will not help much. That’s just my opinion.",32,11.4,2021-07-23

distribute loan fees to stTRU holders. this would, of course, require TrueFi to collect origination fees and/or take a small % of the interest for every loan.  it would decrease the APY for the pools/farms but you’re doing that anyways by reducing TRU emissions.


more fees might be a solution.  i wouldn’t recommend more fees if you don’t have enough liquidity but it appears you have more TVL than you do loans.  so adding a withdrawal fee (Yearn charges 0.5% withdrawal fee, Vesper 0.6%) might make sense.  but of course, you already have an exit fee but that’s a little different.

His comment:

The proposal for step 2 is great, love the concept of the badger model.
Regarding the slashing % dynamic, I think that makes it a bit too complicated.  Ideally Tru should be focused on a way to increase the treasury with stable coins to support any loan defaults, so we don’t have to worry about slashing dynamics.  Then stake the treasury in aave/compound to allow it to grow.
Should also think about doing something similar to the badger model on the borrower side.  Like creating a separate staking system just for borrowers to lock their TRU for infinity, in return they get discounted interest rates on their loans based on the TRU value they locked vs the size of the requested loan.  Could use tiered levels of (locked tru / loan size) %, to determine discount %.  This accomplishes an effective burn of TRU supply and increases token demand.  I don’t really see a downside to this as long as its separate from stkTRU.

Regarding your first point, yeah I guess that’s true. I had not really thought that actually. But yes, if the SAFU/insurance fund was so big, it could eliminate the need for staking.

Building a protocol treasury/backstop from the protocol’s earned fees could improve TrueFi’s risk management and make TRU more attractive (i.e. this could get us to a buy-and-burn or similar model).
As a starting point, TrueFi could direct 10% of interest earned by TrueFi pools into this treasury/backstop (i.e. divert the 10% currently going to stakers). This treasury/backstop would grow steadily over time and once it grew large enough, “excess reserves” could be used to buy-and-burn TRU or distribute funds to TRU stakers (governance would decide what to do with the funds).
While 10% might seem like a trickle today, it can easily build up to $1M+ within a few months. So far in 2021, over $2M has been repaid in interest (i.e. such a treasury would have ~$200k worth of stablecoins had it started in Jan).
My rationale is that “building a warchest and reinvesting into growth” (quoting Hasu here) is the best use of today’s TrueFi protocol fees. Imo, there’s little lost in building the warchest today as governance can always decide to distribute the funds at a later point in time.
Such a system would be similar to MakerDAO’s, which I’d written a bit about earlier this year:



[Ideas] Designing the TrueFi Backstop Fund Ideas


    I like MakerDAO’s System Surplus Buffer as an inspiration for TrueFi’s backstop fund design. 
One simple self-sustaining structure could be: 

[ y ]% of protocol fees earned (earned in tfTUSD or TUSD) are sent to the backstop fund
once backstop fund value reaches >=  $[ x ], then all fees earned go to TRU stakers

['[Proposal] Replace Incentives between TRU Stakers and LP Lenders'],"==========CURRENT SITUATION==========
Incentives for staking TRU:

More TRU tokens
10% of income generated by protocol

Incentives for LP lenders:

More TRU tokens
90% of income generated by protocol

TRU token stakers as of right now only receive 10% of the protocol’s income. This means that as TrueFi grows in TVL and loans given out, the incentive to stake TRU decreases (explained below with math).
So to make money from TrueFi all you need to do is lend to it. Token is seemingly useless.
Staking TRU is not useful at all because you only get more TRU tokens that give you a small 10% of income AND you are at risk of getting slashed. If staking TRU is not useful, then holding it is even less.
Here is the math quoted proving that as the protocol grows, the incentive to stake TRU decreases:


I used the numbers from 0xsupertruper’s article here:
Is $TRU a productive asset? - 0xSuperTRUper’s Newsletter
Using those numbers, with all else remaining constant:

1 billion in loans given out.
30% of TRU staked
Average interest rate of 15%
10$ of fees going to stakers
1,000,000 TRU staked would generate 20,547.945$ per year.

This means that at current price of TRU (0.135$), 1 million TRU = 135,000$.
So at current price of TRU a staker will be rewarded with 15% APY in fees earned.
If TRU price is 0.50$, 1 million TRU = 500,000$
So TRU stakers will be rewarded with 4% APY in fees earned.
If TRU price is 1.00$, 1 million TRU = 1,000,000$
So TRU stakers will be rewarded with 2% APY in fees earned.
If the number of TRU tokens staked decreases, the APY goes up.
If the number of TRU tokens staked increases, the APY goes down further.
So it would only be worth it if TRU stakers decrease and/or TRU price is low.
Conclusion: as TRU increases in value and more loans are being given out, the 10% fee from the protocol becomes less and less attractive to hold and stake.


==========PROPOSED CHANGES==========
Incentives for staking TRU:

Less TRU tokens
50% of income generated by protocol
APY remains unchanged.


Incentives for LP lenders:

More TRU tokens
50% of income generated by protocol
APY remains unchanged.


WHAT THIS ACCOMPLISHES:


TRU can earn passive income. As we get more borrowers/lenders, TRU will generate more money for stakers, giving people a reason to hold and stake TRU (less people dumping, more people buying).


The ONLY way to get the full income is to either buy it on the market (pushes TRU price up), or to farm it and stake it, giving the lending pools capital (more TVL in lending pools).


Lenders will want to balance their funds between the lending pool and staking pools. They don’t need to provide to the lending pools to earn a nice APY on the fees generated by the protocol, but they will need to supply capital in order for the protocol to grow. Smart investors will know that they will need to supply both and keep a balance.


Less people selling TRU. I can tell you right now that if TRU tokens generated 50% of the protocol’s income, it is a crazy deal because that would mean that the staking pool generates more APY than the lending pool. People including myself WILL buy TRU in order to get that juicy APY from staking it.


TL;DR:
In order to to be exposed to the full potential of TrueFi you will need to own it’s token. If this isn’t a good enough reason then I sincerely don’t know what is.
It simply does not make sense that keeping the protocol secure while staking TRU will only at maximum ever get you 10% of the fees while also be the first-line infantry ready to die in case things get dicey.
==========WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF THIS IS NOT DONE==========
These are the 2 only possible outcomes from the current way things are working:
#1- TRU reaches a price so low that even giving it as incentive is useless, staking is useless. End result: TrueFi takes all the aspects of stkTRU and gives it to the lending pool. TRU token has no more use, which is okay because the protocol can still exist. All TRU holders get rekt though, which is still okay as long as the protocol still works. Just investors will be mad I guess. But in the end the protocol still functions without TRU token.
#2- TrueFi decreases the TRU rewards for LPs as planned. So LPs will re-evaluate whether it’s profitable versus other protocols. Some will move away, the rest will keep farming and dumping TRU until its no longer profitable, then leave. The ultimate outcome still circles back to outcome #1.
==========FAQs==========
Question: But holding TRU does have a use because you get 10% income and we can secure the protocol better, why are you saying there is no use?
Answer: Why would I buy and stake a token to get a measly 10% and get the full blown risk of a default when I can get 90% income by lending? That makes zero sense. On-chain data proves that because most of the farmed tokens are dumped.
Question: Why not grow the lending pools first like our strategy outlines right now, then take care of TRU token’s usecase later when we are stable?
Answer: Because growth isn’t about growing one part at the expense of another. There should be a solution to grow both the lending and staking pools at the same time. Lenders will lend to us as long as they make dollars. This solution lets them make those dollars as long as they keep and stake the tokens they receive after lending us their funds.
Question: insert token doesn’t give any incentives to stakers, why should we?
Answer:


MakerDAO uses the income generated to buyback and burn tokens, thus incentivizing token holders. Lenders get 0 income (in fact they pay to use Maker via the stability fee).

AAVE is migrating to a new system, the slashing is not even live yet and they can only secure 22% staked tokens because the incentives for tokenholders aren’t live yet either. AAVE has already promised to give stakers part of the income in the future in their new tokenomics plan.

Curve divides the income from the protocol between the lenders and the people who lock (like staking) their CRV in a 50%/50% split. Guess what? CRV has close to 67% of tokens locked for an average period of 3.68 years. That % has only increased over time, and will probably still increase.

COMP income is given to a Reserve Pool for each token to sustain the security of the protocol in case of cascading liquidations. What they do with the reserves will be up for governance voting in the future when it becomes fully decentralized. The difference between TrueFi is that TRU gives the income to lenders, TrueFi doesnt use this income to secure or help the protocol, we are just giving it to lenders as compensation.

Question: But if we give the same incentives to stakers, then the lenders will all run away?
Answer:
If we don’t give the same incentives to stakers, there is no point in having a TRU token. The price will keep falling to eventually adjust to it’s real intrinsice value which is 10% of protocol income. Lending pools will always be bigger than the staking pool and soon we will be lending out hundreds of millions while having a staking pool that won’t be able to cover any of the big loans.
Lenders only care about APY in terms of dollars. If the token’s value increases, then their dollars (APY) increases. Where will they get dollars when you decrease emissions for the lending pools? By staking? Nope, still no dollars there. They will go get dollars elsewhere and ditch TrueFi.
By giving them TRU that can generate dollars, they will have more incentive to keep TRU and to stake it instead of dumping and causing the price to go down. Hell, maybe they will even go buy some more.
So by giving the protocol’s income to TRU stakers, we are eliminating the downwards pressure on price.
Question: But look, the staking pool has doubled in size from 50M to 100M of TRU tokens locked since February, why are more people staking it if you are saying there’s no incentive?
Answer: Yes that is true, but check the price of TRU in February (floating around 0.25-0.50$). Now look at it’s price now. The price has been declining, thus the TVL in USD has not even increased. It has in fact been staying even or decreasing.
==========CLOSING THOUGHTS==========
Please do not disagree only to disagree, I have crunched a lot of numbers and taken my time to provide on-chain and off-chain data as best as I could in order to come to these conclusions (see other topic replies).  I am not trying to FUD or be a nuisance to the team, I am a simple investor who did his own research, came up with a point of view and presented it here with a proposal in hopes of making the protocol better.
Please provide data or logical reasoning behind why you are voting for or against this proposal, that is all I am asking.

Note that Compound pays out 92.5% of USDC and USDT revenue to its lenders (source: Compound | Proposal Detail #31).
Imo, Compound is a successful case study of a protocol that optimized for creating value for its lenders rather than delivering fees to its native token in the early stages of the protocol.
I’d argue that Compound (the protocol) and COMP (the token) have both been successful without tying fees to its native token.
COMP token is currently 69% off its ATH, which I think speaks to the altcoin market we’re currently living in. If we look at MKR, which employs a buy-and-burn model, it’s also 66% off its ATH.
TL;DR – I’m not convinced that fee structures are driving token prices today.

Compound works with over-collateralized lending. So the borrower needs to give Compound more than what he borrows.
The lender ARE the borrowers. You need to deposit funds into COMP before borrowing funds from it. Our lenders are not our borrowers; you do not need to lend to the LPs to borrow. COMP and TrueFi have very different structures.
I do understand that COMP also does not give incentives to their holders except for governance, but using the case study of COMP to mold TrueFi will not work, unless you tell borrowers that they need to lend a certain amount in the pools (which is not un-collateralized loans anymore).",37,27.4,2021-06-28

I think reducing the interest earned for LPs is a bad idea. I do agree though that the TRU token needs more reasons for people to hold and not sell.
We should overhaul the tokenomics, not just for staking, but for farming. We should follow the curve.fi and require locking TRU in order to gain voting power secure higher farming rates in TrueFi.  This way, we aren’t reducing the interest you can earn through lending, we are just restricting the boosted rates to people who lock TRU.

['[Proposal] Replace Incentives between TRU Stakers and LP Lenders'],"Thanks for posting this, and for the ton of work that obviously went into it.  Feels like there’s one point that is getting missed here: TRU rewards are coming from a (finite) incentive pool. If we want to build a protocol that continues to build value long term, we need to have economics that work even when those incentives are minimal or gone entirely. From that perspective, I don’t see how you have a viable protocol when lenders get only 50% of the interest paid. The risk/reward doesn’t make sense to me. So, I’m firmly in the camp that 90% of the interest goes to the lenders, 10% to the protocol (stakers).
There is a separate question, in my mind, which is how do we allocate TRU incentives to drive growth of the protocol. We have experimented with trying to incentivize borrowers, lenders, and stakers with differing amounts. We know many lenders simply liquidate their incentive tokens, and we’d like to reduce that sell pressure. One way to do that, which I do support, is to pay incentives in stkTRU, not in TRU. This probably should apply to both stakers and lenders, and should reduce sell pressure since there’s a 14-day cooldown.

['[Proposal] Replace Incentives between TRU Stakers and LP Lenders'],"Thank you for the input, as you guys can see I’m pushing for more aggressive changes which would change the tokenomics to a pretty big degree and I am sorry for that aggressiveness.
I also understand where Tyler is coming from when they believe that the incentives do not correlate with the token’s price. Maybe now is not the right time to be giving more incentives to token holders, and I don’t really know what the correct time is, but I do admit that I see the arguments from both sides concerning giving more protocol income to holders.
I believe rewarding lenders with stkTRU would be a very positive step and I welcome that proposal with open arms.
One thing that does sound disastrous to me would be TRU continuing it’s downtrend and bringing the APY down with it, in which case the APY will not be satisfactory to lenders anymore, thus we will lose TVL, which will most probably end up starting a vicious cycle with APY going down further and the token’s price following.
It would be a different story if TRU’s price was not tied in with the APY going to lenders, but in TrueFi’s case, it is.
Maybe I am over-alarmed and that vicious cycle is purely in my imagination because of other external forces, but I wanted to state my points nonetheless. Maybe a bullish recovery for crypto as a whole will float the token up regardless, but I would like some protection measures in case that fails to hold (such as the change in rewards for lenders from TRU to stkTRU).",28,80.6,2021-06-30
['[Proposal] Replace Incentives between TRU Stakers and LP Lenders'],"Indie dev from Compound and large TRU staker here.
I agree that the incentives should be changed in a fashion proposed by @MoreNapalm.
I hold and stake TRU because I highly believe in the protocol, want more of a share in it, AND because doing so generates revenue.
There’s a caveat with that last point. In order to utilize the revenue that my staked TRU generates, I must sell TRU as the tfUSD generated is miniscule.
There’s also the argument about the risk of staking which is very high. There’s currently $21M worth of TRU staked. What happens when a $21M loan defaults? How much staked TRU will be slashed? What effect will slashing have on the price of TRU?
Stakers take on a lot of risk… but this deserves a topic of its own.
I think the question in regards to this topic is who should own the protocol?
I believe it should be a combination of lenders, borrowers, and early adopters/supporters. These are our key stakeholders.
So therefore, I think we should distribute TRU equally among these three stakeholders.
Let’s look at Compound’s USDC market: https://compound.finance/markets/USDC.
$2.4B being lent at a net rate of 3.25%. 1.2% in the form of USDC interest, and 2.05% in the form of COMP distribution. USDC lenders on Compound earn more in COMP than in USDC.
So all in all, I agree with this proposal. Keep the APYs the same, but change the revenue composition. More TRU and less stablecoins for lenders. More stablecoins and less TRU for stakers. Maybe even incentivize borrowing by distributing TRU to borrowers.",27,25.4,2021-06-30

['[Proposal] July 29 - August 12 TrueFi LP Incentives'],"Authors :
Ryan Rodenbaugh, Tyler Wallace
Summary
Decrease total LP emissions by 5% from 370,000 TRU/day to 350,000 TRU/day

Decrease tfUSDT by 25,000 TRU/day to 100,000 TRU/day
Increase tfTUSD by 5,000 TRU/day to 55,000 TRU/day
No change to tfUSDC: emissions remain at 195,000 TRU/day

These changes will go into effect around 11:00 am PST on Thursday, July 29, 2021
Background
Keeping with the cadence started on June 15, we’d like to reevaluate the LP TRU incentives every two weeks to (1) try and gradually decrease emission over time (2) target utilizations near 60-70% for each pool.
Motivation

Recent community sentiment has supported lower TRU reward emissions to lenders
Utilization across TrueFi is currently at 72%, in line with our overall target utilization

tfUSDT (47%) is well below target utilization → proposal would decrease tfUSDT incentives
tfTUSD (96%) is well above target utilization → proposal would increase tfTUSD incentives
tfUSDC (76%) is near target utilization → leave as is


Interest rates across DeFi stablecoin markets remain low
Adjusting emissions gradually based upon utilization rates help us test and build a sustainable, long-term model for TrueFi lender incentives

Note on upcoming tfTUSD migration
Within the next few weeks, we plan to upgrade the tfTUSD lending pool from its legacy v1 contract to a v2 pool contract.
As the tfTUSD migration occurs, TRU incentives should be split proportionally between legacy tfTUSD and new tfTUSD token holders such that rewards are distributed fairly between the legacy and new pools as the migration occurs. We will share more details on the proposed migration as the time nears.

Summary
Decrease total LP emissions by 10% from 412,500 TRU/day to 370,000 TRU/day

Decrease TUSD by 12,500 TRU/day to 50,000 TRU/day

These changes will go into effect around 11:00 am PST on Thursday, July 15, 2021
Background
Keeping with the cadence laid out on June 15, we’d like to reevaluate the LP TRU incentives every two weeks to (1) try and gradually decrease emission over time (2) target utilizations near 60-70% for each pool.
Motivation

Recent community sentiment has supported lower TRU reward emissions to lenders
Utilization across TrueFi is currently at 47%, below our target range of 60-70%; this proposal would reduce TRU rewards most for pools with the lowest utilization rates

tfUSDT (36%) and tfTUSD (44%) pools are well below target utilization
tfUSDC (55%) is only modestly below target utilization


Interest rates across DeFi stablecoin markets remain low
Adjusting emissions gradually based upon utilization rates help us test and build a sustainable, long-term model for TrueFi lender incentives

Against: Keep current incentives as is

What Happened:
On January 19th, 2021, a proposal was made to migrate the TRU/ETH liquidity provider incentives from Uniswap to Sushiswap, with the logic that the migration would engender community cross-promotion to reach new users, and also offer double rewards: SUSHI & TRU.
The proposal passed a Snapshot vote on February 2nd, 2021, with a reduction in the outgoing TRU rewards: Sushiswap LPs to receive 10,108 TRU per day (20% of Uniswap incentives).
With a “double rewards” feature to ship with Sushiswap V2, it was believed the combination of SUSHI & TRU rewards would drive pool returns to an attractive range, as high as +100% APY.
Sushiswap incentives were designed to launch at the conclusion of the Uniswap TRU/ETH farm, which ended March 22nd, 2021. Though some Uniswap LPs migrated their funds starting February 5th, after the vote was passed, the majority of LP activity occurred in March onwards.
Unfortunately, Sushiswap V2’s launch (and by extension, double rewards functionality) was delayed to accommodate audits and test deployments, so TRU rewards were never distributed to Sushiswap LPs.*
Sushiswap LPs did, however, receive SUSHI rewards via Onsen as well as trading fees.

Additional resources:

SushiSwap TRU/ETH LP (SLP) Token Tracker
Sushiswap LP Analytics


*TRU/ETH Onsen rewards also recently ran out, though this was explained to have been a V1 > V2 migration mistake and are being restored.

Goal of this Proposal:
This proposal seeks to distribute TRU intended to be used for Sushiswap LP rewards retroactively to LPs who participated in the Sushiswap pool between March 22nd and May 20th, 2021 - the end of Uniswap incentives, and the launch of TrueFi V3, respectively.
The intention is to appropriately compensate Sushiswap LPs commensurate with the expectations set by the TrueFi & Sushiswap teams during the original proposal.

Supporting Data

Sushiswap LPs did receive SUSHI rewards and fees
Sushiswap LPs did not earn TRU rewards (this is why we’re proposing this!)
22% ROI for users in Sushi LP from snapshot on 2/5 to 5/20 launch

ROIs differ for users who entered and exited the pool at different dates, of course

The number of impacted LPs: 33

Note: Largest LP was company treasury; any TRU farmed by the treasury would have been burned, so this LP can be excluded
Source: Dune Analytics


If farm had run at the expected rate of 10,108 TRU per day from 3/22/21 to 5/20/21, LPs would have received 172k TRU (or ~$60k USD at current $0.33 TRU price)

Calculations for what each address would have received had farm been running


Discussion: Should Sushiswap LPs be compensated? At what rate?
The most generous argument: Considering the total amount of USD, at ~$60k, is relatively small, the most generous consideration is to distribute the reward to Sushiswap LPs in full, many who entered the pool in anticipation of TRU rewards. These community participants do a service for TrueFi and it can be argued they’re worth taking care of. The most generous idea is to grant LPs 100% of the allocated TRU from the date the snapshot was passed.
Conservative arguments: A high APY farm launching would have attracted more capital to the pool, diluting the LPs. It can be argued TrueFi should only allocate 75-50% of the allotted incentives to reflect this theoretical inflow.
Argument against disbursement proposal: In fact, most LPs made a decent return on the pool regardless of double rewards not being enacted: approximately 20% ROI.

Discussion:
Let’s start a discussion about (a) whether these LPs should be retroactively rewarded for their service to TRU liquidity and (b) to what extent (ie 100%, 75% or “most generous,” “starting at X date, not Y date”)

EDIT (June 1, 2021): After 4 days of discussion, the vote is now live below:




YES, distribute 100% of the estimated rewards (172k TRU) to the 33 affected Sushi LPs
NO, do NOT distribute 100% of the TRU rewards to the 33 affected LPs

['[Proposal] Balancing TRU incentives VS Lending Pool Incentives'],"Hello everyone,
I want to make a few proposals to the community because I see some problems with the TRU token’s utility and value and would like to address the concerns that some members including myself have and propose of a solution to fix them. This proposal is by no means a final draft, and I want to open more discussion and ideas concerning this.
We have seen a previous proposal/idea of incentivizing borrowers by giving them a lower rate if have TRU tokens staked, but this proposal takes it a little further than that.
The tricky thing that TrueFi has to deal with is scaling both the staking pool and the lending pool at the same time while balancing the risk vs. reward for both parties.
Both the staking pool and the lending pool(s) are pillars to the TrueFi protocol, but if we place more emphasis on the lending pools, then I believe there is actually no incentive to have a TRU token at all: If we remove the TRU token + the staking pool and only operate with lending pools, the protocol essentially remains the same. Take the slashing from the staking pool and add it to the lending pools and the main fuctions of this protocol remains unchanged regardless of whether there is a TRU token or not.
Important Premises to Explain:
#1 - Give generated revenue from the protocol to the TRU staking pool. Lower generated revenue from the protocol to the lending pools.
#2 - The rate of emissions for TRU tokens should be greater in the lending pools than the TRU staking pool.
#3 - Emissions to the lending pools should be changed to stkTRU instead of TRU tokens directly.
#4 - Have a better slashing rate for the staking pool and add a slashing rate for the lending pools.
--------------------------------------
Explanation of Premise #1
Giving generated revenue back to TRU stakers is essentially equivalent to giving a better loan rate for borrowers who stake their TRU. Both accomplish the same desired outcome. Since this incentivizes borrowers to actually hold TRU, they will most likely increase their share in the staking pool, making it even more counter-productive to default on loans.
This will scale the usage of TrueFi into our native TRU token directly. More loans being emitted will increase the APY in the staking pool, thus arbitrage will drive more TRU tokens to be staked. This also solidifies the significance of the TRU token as equity.
Note: Many protocols don’t seem to give income out to their users and do manage to still have a functioning product, but keep in mind that TrueFi is already giving this income out at current time, so TrueFi is already, by definition, not part of that category of protocols.
--------------------------------------
Explanation of Premises #2 and #3
The lending pools should be given more TRU ownership to lending pool providers because not only are they contributing to one of the pillars of the protocol, but having shrinking lending pools is obviously bad.
One solution to this is to give the lending pools stkTRU instead of TRU tokens directly.  This would effectively put a lock-up on their rewards as well as keep the APY the exact same. Not only will it delay some token dumping, but it will also give participants of the lending pool a direct access to the staking pool and provide much more liquidity in the staking pool at any given time.
If tied together with #1, we are basically changing the dynamics to this environment:
- TRU stakers will be earning more income (rewarded in USDT/USDC/TUSD…).
- Lending pool providers will be earning more equity (rewarded in stkTRU).
In my opinion this makes more sense than what we currently have now, where both earn TRU tokens (tokens which only produce 10% of income generated when staked as opposed to 90% for lenders).
--------------------------------------
Explanation of Premise #4
Since #1 to #3 creates a different dynamic, the staking pool and the lending pools will each earn a different income weighted by equity vs. income. Thus having an even slashing rate would maybe make this much more balanced.
As it currently stands, the TRU staking pool will always be the first one to get slashed, and whatever remains defaulted that can’t be paid by the maximum slashing of 10% from the staking pool will be covered by the lending pools themselves.
With our current numbers in the staking pool, it is quite obvious that with any default over 3-5M, the protocol would have to use a little of the lending pools to repay the loan.  Any default over 5M will be significantly more risky to the lending pools. This means that as it currently stands, staking TRU rewards you with more tokens that will be first in line to get penalized in case of any defaults, without generating any income, but that you can use to vote for who to distribute loans to.  Contributing funds to one pool with a completely different pool taking the first hit of the risk is very… weird?
I believe no pool should come as “more important” than the other, as both need to be equally scaled and growing in order to have a stronger protocol.

CURRENT SITUATION
With all this said, the benefits are massively skewered to the side of providing loans to the protocol instead of holding or staking TRU. As it currently operates, there is actually not much need for a TRU token for TrueFi to function properly.
On-chain data confirms that providing to the lending pools has a better risk vs. reward than contributing to the staking pool (by a huge margin). At current time of writing, we have 224 Million $ in the lending pools, compared to only ~ 20 Million $ in the staking pool. Also being in both those pools, I can tell you that there is less incentive for me to be in the staking pool than the lending pools.
Swapping the rewarded assets between the lending pools and the staking pool will not change the APY at all, it will simply swap the type of rewards given out.
--------------------------------------
ROLLING OUT IN STEPS/PHASES
Making all these changes without losing any momentum would require different rollout phases, because such drastic changes will make investors uncomfortable and most probably reduce the liquidity in the lending pools, which is very bad. So I have a proposed rollout solution (not a final draft at all, up for discussion) that is broken down in multiple Phases, each comprising of 4 steps.
Each Phase will include these Steps:
1- Remove 10% of TRU rewards from staking pool.
2-Add 10% of TRU rewards to stable pools.
3- Remove 10% of generated income from stable pools.
4- Add 10% of generated income to staking pool.
We should start with removing 10% of TRU rewards from the staking pool because it will lead to the least amount of damage (the pool is already too weak, a little less in there won’t spell doom for the protocol).
Notice that the lending pools will never, under any circumstances, have a net negative impact in terms of APY, they will only have brief periods where they can benefit from a 10% bonus before their rewards are swapped from one asset to the other. So the lending pools should technically not suffer any losses during the time it will take to change.
It would also help to market and advertise the bonus rates of the lending pools during the 2 weeks of added incentives, which might see more capital inflow into the lending pools. Will they stay forever? Maybe, maybe not, but at least more capital will want to flow in to take advantage of the rate and more exposure was gained; and all this while fixing the problem.
These Phases can be done over and over until we reach a sufficiently balanced state. Maybe instead of 10% per Phase, we can do 5% (the rate was only given as 10% for example purposes).
--------------------------------------
Moving Forward
Moving forward, I would suggest these proposals to be reviewed by the community/team members:
#1
Slowly swap the income generated by the protocol (rewarded in Stablecoins) from the lending pools to the staking pool with the staking rewards generated by the staking pool (rewarded in stkTRU) to the lending pools. Rolling out in Phases will be more effective to retain all TVL. As for the % we should move at every step, that is up for discussion, as I cannot predict how the TVL will change based on the exact amounts, but I think anything between 5-10% would work well.

Stakers will be getting rewarded with MORE income (aka stablecoins) and LESS TRU.
Lenders will be getting rewarded in MORE equity (aka stkTRU tokens) and LESS stablecoins.

The APYs of each pool should remain unchanged.
#2
Emissions to the lending pools should be changed to stkTRU instead of TRU tokens directly.
#3
Amend the slashing rate to a fixed 50%/50% between the lending pools and the staking pool. I believe this change should be saved for last for the following reasons:

With our current pool of borrowers we have onboarded and using our platform, the default rate seems to be very small, quasi-none. So the slashing rate is not our most important concern at current time.
Boosting the TVL of the staking pool to catch up with the scaling of the lending pools is much more important, and having more incentive to stake TRU should hence, be a priority.
Since the APYs technically do not change much I don’t believe changing the slashing % would have much of an effect, and it is in no way compromising any APY for the lending pools at all.

With these proposals in place, we could follow the intended consequences with this logic:

Since stakers earn USDT/USDC/TUSD, they will be able to apply upward pressure on TRU’s price by using those earned stablecoins to buy TRU.
If stakers want to deposit their rewarded USDT/USDC/TUSD from staking in the lending pools, then that is also a positive gain for the lending pools TVL.
On the flip-side, since lenders are earning more stkTRU, there will be less short term dumping of TRU, thus resulting in less downward pressure on TRU’s price.
Lenders have a possibility of treating the stkTRU as income-generating assets, possible leading to less downward pressure on TRU’s price.

I believe these proposals will help scale the usage of TrueFi directly to it’s native TRU token. There must be a lot of stuff in here that people will disagree with, but I am ready to take the heat. Love it or hate it, this is my proposal and I do stand by it. I would also like to listen/read about what others think about what I got wrong in case I am completely missing some points.
Again, nothing in this proposal is set in stone, but I would like to know the community and team member’s thoughts about them.

['[Proposal] Balancing TRU incentives VS Lending Pool Incentives'],"Thanks for posting, @MoreNapalm. This is thoughtful and well-written.
I fully support proposal #2 – I would also like to see lenders receive rewards in stkTRU, just as Aave provides stkAAVE rewards.
Re: proposals #1 and #3, I want to spend some time thinking on these also. My initial reactions are below:
Pros: I like the idea of stakers having more “skin in the game” and giving them more incentive to be highly involved in TrueFi’s credit decisioning and governance. And I agree that if TRU stakers are exposed to more risk, they should also capture more of the value generated by the protocol. 50% sounds high, I’d be more inclined to start at 25% or 30% (Aave again is a good comp here – stkAAVE slashing rate is 30%).
Cons: “Moving” value from lenders to stakers means that the real, non-boosted yields for TrueFi lenders will decrease. I think it’s important that TrueFi lending yields on uncollateralized loans remain higher than fully-collateralized DeFi yields on Compound, Aave, Curve, etc. If TrueFi’s real lending returns don’t beat crypto’s “risk-free” rates then I fear others won’t believe TrueFi’s economics are sustainable. For this reason, I’m reluctant to divert much more than the current 10% of interest away from lenders.
I don’t see a problem with stakers earning returns primarily in TRU (or stkTRU) at this early stage of the protocol. My working assumption is that most TRU stakers are people like me, who are bullish on the long-term vision of the protocol and happy to accumulate more TRU. Curious to hear how others think about this.",42,33.4,2021-06-24
['[Proposal] Balancing TRU incentives VS Lending Pool Incentives'],"The strategy I was more inclined to do was the “swap” the assets received by lenders and stakers. Basically the APY should remain the same after these changes, with the following differences:

Stakers will be getting rewarded with MORE income (aka stablecoins) and LESS TRU.
Lenders will be getting rewarded in MORE equity (aka stkTRU tokens) and LESS stablecoins.

But the APY for both of the pools should not change in the slightest. The goal is to change the rewarded underlying assets, not the APYs. We are already outperforming Yearn/AAVE/Compound for the rewards on both the lending pools and the staking pool, so there should be no problem.
Of course, the rates will change based on the price of TRU token, but we are essentially swapping the asset rewarded between the pools.
I have also edited some wording to make the explanations clearer as well as changed the term “move” to “swap”.
And of course, being an early adopter, I would also want to accumulate the most TRU possible, which is precisely what I am doing. I personally am both staking and lending at the moment, also never sold a single token.These proposals can certainly be pushed further down the road, but I do believe that these proposals have a chance of boosting the price of the TRU token (probably not immediately, but certainly in the future, because it will now be tied directly to the performance of the protocol).
The only thing I fear is that momentum can be lost on the TRU token and with the current way the rewards are set up, we will keep seeing token dumping with almost no incentive to stake the TRU (the on-chain data clearly proves my point). We all want to accumulate TRU, that is 100% fact, I am just worried TRU will slump into a position where it is rendered useless and much much harder to attribute a direct incentive to.
I believe that having a solution so the lending pools and staking pool grow side-by-side would be much more healthy in the long term.
UPDATE: Also made some changes to the concrete proposals in the end again. I might keep editing the proposal as more stuff comes up, unless staff think it’s better the changes reflect in the discussion instead?",41,33.2,2021-06-25
['[Proposal] Balancing TRU incentives VS Lending Pool Incentives'],"Something TrueFi desperately needs is some good PR, and though I see some effort being made to attract people to the protocol, I don’t see how this will be moving the needle to the positive if TRU’s price faces repeated downward pressure. If the protocol isn’t being structured to support TRU with metrics designed to protect it, why should anyone be interested in the token? The WeChat group has been a good indicator of the sentiment to be expected should TRU remain vulnerable to constant offloading. I’ve personally seen my TRU devalue to the tune of 65% from entry, and as much as I may believe in the protocol long term, that’s not an acceptable position in the face of what feels very often like ambivalence.

I would also like to know if anyone has counter-arguments or logical fallacies in the proposals I have given.
I have quoted the part where I do address the intended outcome when it comes to the price of TRU:


With these proposals in place, we could follow the intended consequences with this logic:

Since stakers earn USDT/USDC/TUSD, they will be able to apply upward pressure on TRU’s price by using those earned stablecoins to buy TRU.
If stakers want to deposit their rewarded USDT/USDC/TUSD from staking in the lending pools, then that is also a positive gain for the lending pools TVL .
On the flip-side, since lenders are earning more stkTRU, there will be less short term dumping of TRU, thus resulting in less downward pressure on TRU’s price .
Lenders have a possibility of treating the stkTRU as income-generating assets, possible leading to less downward pressure on TRU’s price .


",37,17.4,2021-06-25
['[Proposal] Balancing TRU incentives VS Lending Pool Incentives'],"We’ve had similar discussions before, but this is bold and thought provoking. I like the idea of swapping the incentives, but we’ll have to figure out the right balance. I don’t agree with the equal slashing because although there are some arguments against this, I see the lenders as a more risk averse group. I’m certain over time, a rising lending pool TVL itself will contribute to raising the price of TRU. That said, we need to find a balance that rewards TRU stakers more in return for the additional level of risk as junior tranche “lenders”.",32,91.4,2021-06-25
['[Proposal] Balancing TRU incentives VS Lending Pool Incentives'],"I would be inclined to agree with you purely on a theoretical standpoint, but let’s take data to examine this.
Total TVL going up should give the TRU token an upwards pressure on price, since TVL is a very important metric in DeFi and protocols in general, but in the case of TRU, there are a few differences as to why the TVL would not affect the price.
TVL and utilization of the protocol have only gone up while the price of TRU still has downward pressure because there is a disconnect between the TVL + utilization and the value of TRU.
Let’s say we now have 1b TVL with 80% utilization.
Now what has changed in the opportunity cost of holding TRU? I would still prefer to be a lender than a staker, because I get 90% of income generated with the stakers taking the blunt force of any defaults before I have a chance to get hit. I am also accumulating TRU tokens that I find are pretty useless because I would not want to participate in staking at all, thus I will treat this as income and sell them.

==============================
So after analyzing this data, you can clearly see that the actual opposite is true:
Higher TVL in the lending pools generating more TRU dumped on exchanges, thus Higher TVL is actually applying downward pressure on TRU price. So with the current methodology we are using to boost TVL in the lending pools, it will cost us downward pressure on price with absolutely zero gain in our staking pool used to secure from defaults.
You can counter-argue with me saying that “all they need to do is realize how valuable TRU is and hodl man, TRU 100x eoy”, but is it 100% clear as day that the lenders are dumping their TRU. None of them find TRU valuable, they would rather reap from the APY and put that money elsewhere. This is factual analyzing on-chain data.
All in all, the TVL and utilization has only risen, but it has not stopped any of the farmed token dumping. I am not even speaking about the price of TRU because all markets are down, so a decreasing price is okay. We should be looking at the % of TRU farmed and dumped and see if it has decreased (which it has not). I believe there needs to be changes done to turn negative pressure into positive pressure.
And what will happen when the incentives run out? The TRU token incentives will diminish to a point where they can get better yield elsewhere. The point I am trying to make is that there has to be an advantage to holding and staking TRU, and if that advantage is “well, now it’s better to stake TRU than to lend to the pools, things will balance out”, then I would kindly disagree and say that all this TVL is going to go elsewhere.",36,102.2,2021-06-25

Napalm has done a really great and data-driven research and proposal.
I believe that inventing new incentive mechanics is really much needed in order for TRU to have any sustainable value in the long term.
These problems are regularly met around the Defi on other protocols as well.
Lenders want APY - most of the time they don’t vote, stake, or care about the project.
Switching incentives is just a small step, otherwise, the value of the token will get demolished, especially in a prolonged bear market.
If I’m not mistaken currently is even below pre-sale prices, which is quite a weird thing.
I would even consider a percentage of the fees generated from the borrows to be used as a TRU buy-back mechanism of some sort. That way the business value will be directly correlated with the value of the TRU token, which should be quite a strong incentive to stake, hold, vote, and generally care about the project.
On a side note, all kinds of token economics improvements are really a great marketing and PR tool, which spreads awareness about the protocol organically.",28,50.6,2021-06-26

I’m not sure there’s a problem with this. Lenders and borrowers are driving most of the value on TrueFi today. Without lenders putting funds into the pools and borrowers taking loans, protocol fees don’t get created.

Sorry for the tangent on the 1B TVL, TRU going to zero was not the intended message I wanted to convey. What I was supposed to say was that the value of TRU will always be capped by that 10% revenue generated and off-set by the risk of slashing, which in all honesty doesn’t make the token attractive much.
It is very simple what I want to accomplish, and I believe this is also what other users want to see:

TrueFi has more TVL and more loans, more usage.

TRU token has upward pressure because people would want to hold it
Right now that is not what is going on.

Even if we had a bull market + lower interest rates + more TVL, none of those things change the fact that it is not worth it to hold and stake TRU. Or am I missing something?



 tylerw:


if the idea is to grow protocol fees, we can do that two ways: by (1) increasing fees to TRU, or (2) by generating more loans.



(1) I believe that increasing fees to TRU will give TRU more value as an investment that is not purely derived from hype. It will provide income that is balanced by the risk that stakers have to take to stake their tokens.
(2) Generating more loans is good for the protocol in general and is very important, but no matter how much more loans are generated, the fact that staking TRU is not worth the risk vs. reward will not fix anything concerning the TRU token.

And without anyone staking TRU or even holding it, the protocol can still exist and operate quite normally. Sorry, but i’m going to ask this: why even need a TRU token then? I didn’t know the point was that lending pools were more important than the staking pools, I’ve always thought you should view them as equally important…

As TVL increases, the amount of TRU farmed by lenders should stay constant or decrease.


And when those TRU token incentives run out, what will keep the Lenders on TRU instead of going to another protocol to get better yield?
Are we assuming that lowering emission rates will increase the price of TRU? Because it has yet to happen, and there is literally nothing in the data provided that is indicating more holders and stakers for TRU at all.  95%+ of the decrease in price for the TRU token comes from the lending pool farmers, in fact, long-term holders have been holding on their TRU instead.
I am scared of this situation happening (which I believe will happen):
1. Decrease in emissions for the lending pools over time.
2. Farmers will move elsewhere to gain better yield because yield is no longer attractive.
3. Less TRU will be dumped on the market.
4. Still no upwards pressure in TRU price.
Result: Loss in TVL + no upwards pressure on TRU price. Instead of bleeding faster, we will just be bleeding slower. Still no reason to hold TRU as a token.

I suppose that is one way to look at it, I mean all the proposals concerning giving TRU token more incentives could be pushed further down the line in all honesty.
I am just worried that if we take that approach we would end up in a position where we have a semi-dead token with low price and low volume and our only solution is something like doing CPR to it. Because CPR doesn’t always work.
==============================
To conclude, I do have 2 questions I would like the team to answer if possible:


May I ask the team to explain the incentives are of actually holding and staking TRU? It seems like giving lenders TRU instead of stablecoins would make them run away, therefore you guys are kind of admitting that TRU tokens are less valuable than stablecoins logically speaking here… Just curious to know the team’s thoughts in case I am missing a point.


Can I assume that the team’s plan is to boost the TVL of the lending pools as much as you guys can and then fix the incentives for holding/staking the TRU token later? I’m not against that idea at all.


I know I am in no power to be owed any explanations and there are maybe things you guys need to keep under wraps such as future improvements/updates/partnerships, but as an avid investor in TRU I believe it would be okay for me to ask these questions.

On another note, has anyone thought of the dynamics if TrueFi used a portion of the generated income to buy and burn TRU?",31,116.2,2021-06-27
['[Proposal] Balancing TRU incentives VS Lending Pool Incentives'],"Hey,
The purpose of this post is to give you feedback from someone Lending, Investing, and Staking
in the Truefi protocol with reasonable size.
I believe that from a game theory perspective the right incentives are always the most important driver and premise for a protocol’s success and growth.
Right now the incentive for lenders is to instantly sell their TRU rewards on the open market, simply because they have no idea how long that yield will be generated for. Weekly yields in the range of 0.1-1% are really non-existent anywhere else except in the Defi world. So, if you’re a sophisticated investor or money manager you’re only looking to exploit these yields, simply because the risk to reward is quite amazing and the time horizon is unknown. The data suggest this pretty clearly as it is showing that all major lenders do is sell.
If you’re a TRU investor and stake your tokens to secure the protocol from loan defaults and you’re aware of that huge ongoing inflation from lenders, you will seriously start to lose the incentive to do that, simply because your staked TRU will be losing value constantly - as it happens lately after all the pools have been opened.
Unfortunately, to me, it’s pretty clear that in such a way the incentives to generally participate in staking, securing, and voting in the protocol are getting screwed a bit and really only depend on the 10% fees generated from loans, which I receive as a reward in TRU once again.
I believe that Napalm has started a beautiful discussion of a needed reinvention of token economics and alignment of the incentives in the protocol.

Decreasing emissions.
Switching incentives and rewards between lenders and stakers.
Implementing a buy-back or burn mechanism that is correlating with fees generated.

These are all good suggestions so far, that would be a great start to an internal discussion.
On a side note all these buy and burn mechanisms FTX uses with all their tokens - FTT, SRM, FIDA
are actually working and giving quite a strong incentive to speculators, investors and retail to hold the token. To me that’s a general expression or a share of the business - and that’s quite valuable if the business is considered to be potential or it actually generates revenue as is the case here.
What I’ve learned for 4-5 years in the spaces is that memes and the right incentives to hold a token generated the strongest communities over time.
And in terms of marketing and PR changes the token economics/incentives are one the biggest catalysts that drive the attention of the whole space and are the best word of mount tool. Value through scarcity.
Obviously, all these suggestions in the past few days have to be well analyzed and discussed in the team internally so the incentives between lenders, borrows, stakers and investors are aligned and work in the best interest of everyone in the long term.",32,101.4,2021-06-27
['[Proposal] Balancing TRU incentives VS Lending Pool Incentives'],"Before making significant changes to incentives, I would want to better understand the risk profiles of our lenders. We can assume capital preservation is a key concern and common to all profiles. But what kind of expectations do they have on returns?


Do they expect stable rates of return only in stablecoin? Are these lenders new to the crypto world? Are they crypto veterans who want a portion of their portfolio in lower risk assets?


Would they accept a variable return solely based on a volatile crypto token?


Would they prefer/accept a mixture of returns in both stablecoin and crypto?


Or are they temporarily in stablecoin before they plow into BTC or ETH in  their cold wallets upon market resolution?


The problem there is no way for us or the team know the answers to these questions. I would be wary of targeting a 100% swap of incentives between lenders and stakers.

['[Proposal] Replace Borrower Incentives with Referral Program'],"Summary

Eliminate the ‘[borrower incentives] ([Proposal] Growing Borrower Activity with TRU Incentives)’ (rate subsidy) for all future loans.
Use the remaining 593,010 TRU allocated towards that use for a referral program to bring on new borrowers.
Pay 39,534 TRU to any borrower that refers another borrower that qualifies for and originates a loan of at least $500,000

Note: At the moment, we have a CRM w/ 56 existing and potential borrowers at varying onboarding stages. These 56 borrowers include borrowers who have already taken out loans, some actively onboarding, some we need to catch up with. While we can’t share that list publicly, we’ll do ‘scouts honor’ with borrowers so that if they introduce us to someone that (a) we have never spoken to (b) have on the list, but aren’t actively onboarding with, we will pay out the referral.
Background


We introduced the ‘borrower incentives ’ as a way to subsidize rates. However, with the introduction of the ‘rate model’ we are seeing lower base rates on average and the ‘borrower incentives’ are now overkill.


Existing borrowers have been the best source of new borrowers. Many of our repeat borrowers today come from introductions or recommendations from earlier borrowers. We’d like to give borrowers even more of a reason to incentive new TrueFi borrowers.


Motivation:

One of the top priorities right now is to increase utilization in the pools. Bringing on new borrowers is one way to continue doing this.
If this works and we can bring on 15 new borrowers via this program, we can consider expanding this program.

['[Proposal] Replace Borrower Incentives with Referral Program'],"

Am I correct in assuming the incentive goes to the co. treasury of the organization the referrer represents instead of the individual ?


Would there be any value in doing an informal survey with existing borrowers in an attempt to quantify their level of interest in this type of incentive? In addition to engaging them in the process, I think participants would be compelled to help make the process successful ( actually make referrals ) if they feel some ownership for the process they helped create. In reality, if we do not don’t identify CCR’s as part of the incentive plan, we might introduce something ineffective. I think that risk justifies taking the extra time to identify their critical requirements instead of assuming we know best. I’m not proposing a full blown statistically correct survey. I think something more qualitative ( a quick discussion that the business development people could have in the normal flow of their discussions with borrowers ) would suffice. In reality, they might have ideas which would result in an even better incentive strategy that would benefit both process owners. I just think we are missing a key step in the process if we fail to do this.

['[Proposal] Reduce all farm emissions by 30%'],"Background & Motivation
Hello community. A few weeks ago we approved a proposal to boost farming rates 2x as a promotion around the USDC launch. This launch & promotion successfully grew TVL very significantly. We then had a vote to extend these higher rates.
Overall this was a very successful program, but we are now in a position where TVL has grown but TRU price is going down steadily as farmers sell their TRU. @tylerw is observing behavior of farmers on-chain and it does look like a significant fraction of the farmed TRU is being sold into the market.
We’ve been in this situation before (high farm emissions, weak TRU price), and the solution is to reduce farm emissions. This should lead to less TRU being sold and potentially a price increase. Depending on how price reacts to the lower farm emissions, actual APYs for farmers could stay the same or even go up. We’ll learn a lot from making this change, and worst case, if we don’t see good results, we can take a vote and reverse it.
If we don’t act, I expect we’ll continue to see a weak TRU price and our farms will be stuck in a painful place where they have to keep shooting out lots of cheap TRU rather than a smaller amount of expensive TRU.
We were in exactly this same position some months ago (high farm emissions, TRU price steadily decreasing), and once we took the logical step of reducing farming rates, we turned the situation around. This is the time to do exactly the same thing.
Hence my proposal to reduce all farm emissions by 30%. This is meant to be a significant but not overwhelming change that will give us valuable data on how we want to proceed going forward.

['[Proposal] TrueFi to Offer Private Borrowing'],"Over the last few months, we have received continued inbound interest from highly reputable Borrowers seeking to borrow on an anonymous basis. The reason for this request is typically because the Borrower does not want to publicly reveal their (a) capital need and/or (b) company profile/attributes (disclosure in some cases prohibited by their internal compliance).
We have observed that this request is typically being made by some of the largest potential borrowers and our inability to service this request immediately stalls further interest.
With growth in borrower demand/diversification being critical to the growth of the protocol, we believe it is time to reevaluate and allow borrowers to obtain loans on an anonymous basis. Offering private borrowing will allow the protocol to scale rapidly over time and appeal to crypto and traditional finance borrowers who prefer confidentiality which is typical across institutional lending.
Key Considerations:
-All new borrowers will continue to publish a post in our forum seeking approval to borrow, however may do so with company name redacted. The posts will require a description of the borrower, explanation of credit support and use of funds.
-TrustToken will continue to perform the exact same compliance and underwriting process for public and private borrowers, i.e. no change in risk analysis and borrower whitelisting.
-All borrowers will receive a credit score which will be made public and will be used to determine loan parameters including loan amount and interest rate.
-Borrowers who elect private borrowing must be considered high credit quality and achieve a minimum threshold credit score.
-Borrower will be unmasked and made public in the event of default thus reputation continues to remain a critical underwriting parameter.
-Borrowers who elect to borrow privately will be subject to a [~50]bps risk premium in interest rate to account for the additional credit risk
-TrustToken will in the near future attempt to retain an independent third party (i.e. accounting firm) to validate via attestation the borrower’s identity, receipt of required diligence materials and completion of all compliance and underwriting requirements.
We believe this is a critical step in scaling TrueFi and as such welcome your feedback.

['[Proposal] A Medium-Term Strategy for Lending Pool Incentives'],"Summary

Launch USDT pool on Friday, June 18, 2021 with TRU incentives of 200,000 TRU/day for two weeks
Decrease TUSD lending pool incentives on Friday, June 18, 2021 to 100,000 TRU/day for two weeks
Decrease USDC lending pool incentives on Friday June 18, 2021 to 200,000 TRU/day for two weeks
We revisit the # of TRU distributed to lenders every two weeks and host a Snapshot vote to update incentives in response to utilization rates

(This should give enough time for this to be voted on and lenders to be made aware)
Background:
Going off my earlier post ([Ideas] A longer-term strategy for lending incentives), I want to propose a short/medium-term strategy that will

Allow us to add USDT ASAP
Begin to tie TRU boosts to utilization

As a starting point, we should ask – why are TRU incentives useful? TRU incentives are most useful and should be highest when we have borrower demand > lending supply. At the moment, specifically in the TUSD pool, we have very low utilization.
As I shared previously (see my comment on this post: [Discussion] Extending tfUSDC + tfTUSD farms / Adding tfUSDT? - #9 by ryan.rodenbaugh), when I polled our borrowers, most had a preference for USDT and were mostly indifferent between TUSD and USDC (though given one or the other, USDC edges out slightly).
Additionally, I recognize that the above distributions are not perfect, but I also know that “perfect” will require more rigorous analysis (to get to the “correct numbers”) or it will require smart contract work to have an incentive system that dynamically adjusts related to utilization. We have not yet had the chance to run the analysis and will not have the chance to do the smart contract work for a while.
As a result, I think revisiting these numbers every other week is a good opportunity to adjust incentives up and down as needed. We can also see about implementing an Allocation Points program like Sushiswap uses (and like Hal mentioned here). I will also work with @tylerw to turn his comment here about decreasing rewards over time into a more detailed proposal
Motivation
At the moment, we are overpaying for deposits, specifically in the TUSD pool. Rather than taking the TUSD pool to zero, we should begin to temper off rewards over the coming weeks, unless utilization significantly increases. Given the interchangeability of TUSD/USDC and the fact that no borrower has expressed they prefer TUSD over USDC, it might even be optimal if all deposits left TUSD and went into USDC/USDT.

Apologies for my error and any hassle/confusion this may cause.",18,8.6,2021-06-17
['[Ideas] A longer-term strategy for lending incentives'],"Discussed this briefly in Discord, but moving the discussion here.

With the current boosted farms ending in 8-days and with the intention to add USDT this month, we need to think longer-term about how we want to use TRU to incentivize different lending pools.
Some facts:

“Normal” TRU incentives for lending had been 145,467 TRU/day in the TUSD pool.
Per the original allocation, we allocated 195,097,500 total TRU to lending pool incentives and estimated these would go for 1140 days (~3 years). This means our original expectations were that we’d distribute 171,138 TRU/day to lenders across all pools.
The 2x’d currently ongoing rewards for the USDC and TUSD pool are 290,934/day per pool for a total of 581,868 TRU/day.
If we stayed consistent at ~600,000 TRU/day, we’d only have incentives left for 270 days (ending March 7, 2022)

Points to Discuss:

When we add USDT, wETH, and wBTC (which I think are the next three assets we will add), how will we incentivize them?
How long do we want the lender incentives to last? I think another 1.5-2 years is probably conservative with longer preferred. As an example though, if we wanted lender incentives to run for another 2-years, we could only distribue 222,630 TRU/day across all pools. You can see the number of remaining TRU here allocated towards lender incentives here and play around with your own assumptions of TRU/day.
This is probably the first compelling argument I’ve come across for not burning excess Uniswap incentive tokens, but instead reallocating them towards lender incentives to keep a large buffer.

['[Ideas] A longer-term strategy for lending incentives'],"

Incentives for assets like Eth and BTC should be small, if any. With USD, there is competition over opportunity cost of what you could be doing with that money, but there is not much you can do with Eth and BTC.  I think Eth in particular is going to be a tough market because people could just stake it instead and have much lower risks.  Borrowers have not demonstrated they will pay the 10%+ that would justify lending over staking.


Going back to those assets, I would want to start short because its not clear if there is actual demand to borrow them.  Blockfi has been dropping its interest payments for Bitcoin, which suggests there isn’t much. I would not want to commit to a 2 year incentive run, then a few months in we realize there is little demand.

If we wanted to incentivise a specific pool, we could re-balance the allocation points. Much like how SUSHI or CRV rewards currently work
Another thing which we might want to work on Unlock 5 is requiring TRU to be locked in order to boost rewards. That way only people who are locking TRU can get access to farm rewards. This is what CRV does and it seems to work very well.

I’m looking at two things as I offer that reply:
1. How’s our TVL tracking against market cap?
TVL has more than doubled (100m → 250m), while market cap has remained relatively stable (~100m). With the ongoing  assumption TVL is used as an industry standard way of gauging growth/progress (generally leading to growth in market cap), the downward pressure on market cap in the face of rapidly growing TVL is, in my opinion, the rate of TRU outflows.
My sense is that the amount of TRU we’re spending to attract TVL is suppressing growth in market cap, and we’d get similar results in terms of stablecoin deposits with growth in market cap by offering smaller TRU incentives.
2. What is the utilization rate of our existing pools?
Thanks for large loans from a few lenders, our utilization has grown - but before this time, we had a lot of idle capital (in both TUSD and USDC), which we were paying top dollar for in TRU incentives. I think it’s worth decreasing incentives in line with utilization rates: the more borrower demand there is, the more valuable new deposits are - and right now, capital is cheap.",21,54.2,2021-06-15

We introduced the ‘borrower incentives’ as a way to subsidize rates. However, with the introduction of the ‘rate model’ we are seeing lower base rates on average and the ‘borrower incentives’ are now overkill. We will still pay out the incentives to the borrowers who took out a loan between when the original Snapshot passed and now, but no more.
Existing borrowers have been the best source of new borrowers. Many of our repeat borrowers today come from introductions or recommendations from earlier borrowers. We’d like to give borrowers even more of a reason to incentive new TrueFi borrowers.

Details of the Referral Program (to be fleshed out based on comments before formal proposal moves to Snapshot)

Let’s say we have about 900,000 / 1,000,000 of the TRU that were previously allocated towards
It would be great if we could bring on another 20 credible borrowers
I propose that we pay 45,000 TRU to each borrower that refers a new borrower to us that passed our review process and takes out a loan
If this program is effective, we could choose to extend it, but I think 20 is a great starting point.
At the moment, we have a CRM w/ 56 existing and potential borrowers at varying stages of onboarding. These 56 borrowers include borrowers who have already taken out loans (Wintermute, Nibbio, Amber) and some that we plan to reach out to, but have not yet (often because they’re large and we we want to grow a bit before we connect with them). While we can’t share that list publicly, we’ll do ‘scouts honor’ with borrowers so that if they introduce us to someone that (a) we have never spoke to (b) have on the list, but aren’t actively onboarding with, we will pay out the referral.

Thoughts?



Should we do this?

['[Idea] Replace borrower incentives w/ Referral Program'],"I fully support a referral program for borrowers… its actually something i suggested lately, without much detail…
My only fear is that an incentive program solely based on TRU incentives might not be enough to trigger interest… what about the idea to take a slice out (circa 1%) of the new borrowers interests they are bringing for say their first 3-5 loans and reward it to the one bringing the business?
With this, not only you give an additional, more predictable reward, but you also incentivize them to push the new borrowers to take out new loans after their first one.
Also, why limit this program to existing borrowers? we may have people with connections among our community members who maybe would be happy to reach out to potential borrowers?

Too much overhead. Would require changes to the smart contracts presumably since the interest is all coded into and paid directly to the smart contracts.

I think our borrowers are the highest signal group right now and they’re not naturally incentivized to add more borrowers to the pool (although this isn’t strictly true, they might see it as competition for a fixed amount of capital). On the other hand, presumbly everyone in our community owns TRU and is already incnetivized to bring on new borrowers.
I think if this initial program w/ borrowers works, we could consider expanding to a wider group of people to make referrals.",25,10.0,2021-06-09

 RDharia:

Agreed. Referred paid when the loan is funded. Referrer does not have to wait until loan is repaid (since this could be a long time, up to 90 days)

Disagree on this one. Yes, $500k loans don’t make a huge dent right now, but hopefully these are borrowers we could grow with. $5mm is high given our current underwriting standards. If we were going to set a min (I don’t think we need to), I think it should be much lower like 500k-1mm.",16,18.2,2021-06-14
['[Proposal] Decrease rating period from 72-hours to 48-hours'],"Going off of my last post, we want to continue to increase utilization and decrease frictions for borrowers to make loan requests. As the protocol continues to mature (see: Rate Model), I believe this decreases the need for forum posts and ‘rating’ of individual loans. Over time, we will make additional proposals to eliminate these aspects of TrueFi entirely, the process enabling ‘private borrowing’ (more to come on this… but it’s highly requested by many of the industry’s largest borrowers).
As a first step, I’m proposing that we decrease the minimum ‘rating period’ from 72-hours to 48-hours. This means that if a borrower receives the minimum amount of ‘rates’ required, they can withdraw their loan request in as fast as 48-hours, rather than the previous 72-hours.

Current team’s backgrounds include some financial firms like Mirae Asset, Kiwoom Securities, National Pension Service (largest fund in KR), as well as IT companies like Samsung, Kakao, Naver. Combination of our financial and IT expertise gives us an edge to the market.
Overview of our trading strategies on 30+ exchanges

Statistical Arbitrage
HFT market making strategies on rebates
Beta Portfolio
Long/Short (Momentum, Mean Reversion, Text Mining)
Machine Learning
Premium Extraction (Spot to futures, Korean Spot to overseas futures, between Defi protocols)
Defi Yield Farming

Risk Management
We control our risk by statiscally managing market exposure and diversification. The market exposure is systemically handled by the cash and long/short ratio, while diversification is handled by non-linearity of market cohesion.
Partnership with Bithumb
We’re close working partner of Bithumb- real big market maker on Bithumb and one of the few certified borrowers on Bithumb with consistent history paying back the loans (No.1 가상자산 플랫폼, 빗썸)

Borrowed and REPAID 15 loans per size of 30 - 70 BTCs each in last 8 months

VC Investment Arm
Blockwater also has a VC investment arm that actively invested and advised some  great projects from Korea such as Fantom, Bifrost, Metadium, and Playdapp. We are proud to be recognized by global rankings firm Chambers & Partners as a leading venture capital in Korea- but the loan will go to our quant division and put to good use. (VC division will not borrow capital from TrueFi)
Regulated Asset Management
We also have a similar service to BlockFi targeting Korean demographic called https://uupfi.com/. Uupfi is an asset management platform servicing crypto holders in safely depositing their assets while earning interest. We are preparing to acquire Virtual Asset Service Provider license that will become effective in late September per new legislation. We are working full steam to offer regulated and transparent digital asset management services to Korean retail and regulated financial institutions (banks and brokerages) that wants to dip into crypto.
We are currently managing 50M+ assets, just friends and family. We’re in the process of finalizing a Cayman regulated hedge fund for offering, which we’re targeting to launch in July. To my knowledge, I think we have been the most profitable trading company out of Korea since 2017. (Even excluding 2017 records, I still think we’ve done pretty well.)

Currently, our utilization rate of TUSD is at 31% and the rest of our idle capital is deposited in Curve for short-term parking.  100% of USDC are idle currently. Curve TUSD pool is currently offering 12.03% APR. Curve 3pool is currently offering 4.45% APR. We may seek for a higher yield for our lenders from other safe options that allow liquid exit.
Suggestion:


yearn.fi is the largest yield-aggregator with $3.79 billion TVL. It has been battle-tested and has a long track record. No withdrawal fee is collected for its v2 strategy which can allow our liquid exit. 23.99% is offered for its crvTUSD strategy with yveCRV boosted applied and 4.85%  is offered for its crvTUSD strategy with yveCRV boosted.


convexfinance.com is an emerging yield-aggregator which focus on Curve strategy with $508.5 million TVL. It has been audited before its launch and has tight cooperation with Curve. With its cvxCRV boost, 65.34% is offered for its TUSD strategy and 24.99% is offered for its TUSD strategy with cvxCRV boosted .


If the community prefer minimizing the intermediary risk, another possible choice can be our pool locking a small amount of CRV to veCRV (around 1% of our treasury) for 4 years in Curve ourselves. It can provide us up to 2.5x boost for our deposited capital depending on the ratio between veCRV and our deposited idle capital. The small amount of capital investing will significantly improve our performance without adding much fluctation as it only accounts for 1% of our treasury. No additional contract risk is added to our idle capital in this case.

['[Proposal] TrueFi Loan Approval and Rate Setting'],"To date, TRU stakers have voted on each individual loan application, often without much information regarding the borrower beyond reputation. This model has been great for getting off the ground but now requires the first step of automation to be scalable and risk-adjusted.
To that end, we are asking TRU holders to vote on a new TrueFi Rate Model, which will allow for far more efficiency in working with our borrowers and provide clarity on approvals, loan amounts and interest rates. To determine these parameters, the TrueFi Rate Model incorporates data points including lending pool size, current utilization, loan size, borrower assets, and credit score.
Voting on the TrueFi Rate Model reflects your view of the first version of this model and the inputs that drive the analysis including but not limited to the lending pool “Maximum Utilization Ratio %” and our base interest rate “Unsecured Risk Premium”. We expect and acknowledge that the model inputs will continue to be adjusted via subsequent vote as we mature and encounter nuanced borrower profiles.
Ultimately, we expect to have different models and parameters for different lending pools to accommodate varying borrower and lender needs. The TrueFi Rate Model will initially be applied equally across the TUSD, USDC and forthcoming USDT pool.
For now, the TrueFi team will continue to perform compliance including KYC, manage loan agreements, and compute credit scores for prospective borrowers thus ensuring the integrity of the inputs to the model. Over the long term we look forward to decentralizing these aspects of the protocol as well.
We welcome any feedback and encourage you to vote. We believe the TrueFi Rate Model will allow us to deploy loans faster, achieve higher lending pool utilization and build borrower credit history more efficiently within our protocol.

Yes, implement the TrueFi Rate Model.

Automated terms dramatically improve the borrower experience by speeding up time to loan, while also opening up the black box of how a rate is generated for a greater sense of transparency.
This is likely to create more loan activity (IMO) which will raise rates for lenders and increase utilization.
It gives the credit model practical impact on rates, which makes the credit model itself more valuable and thus more likely to succeed across DeFi.

['[Proposal] TrueFi Loan Approval and Rate Setting'],"Hello all,
I was redirected here from the discord chat.
One question that I have: is the legal jurisdiction of the borrower considered when making a loan? Is that information verified?
At some point, defaults will start to happen, and that’s when we’ll see if the project has long term value. Will the legal recourse be effective? I’m just wondering how the system is set up and if it’s capable of launching procedures against entities anywhere in the world, or only in some countries.
Also, if we’re lending to crypto firms, a lot of their assets will be in crypto. Do we ensure that it’s all on the books and in the name of the entity that is receiving the loan?
Lastly, do we check that the people we’re loaning to aren’t involved in terrorism/ money laundering… Just thinking that reputational damage never helps these types of projects…
Cheers!",29,20.8,2021-05-28
['[Proposal] TrueFi Loan Approval and Rate Setting'],"Thanks for your questions McQ-1993. I can probably handle most of the legal questions. @RDharia can address the types of assets our borrowers represent to us as they onboard.
Yes, the legal jurisdiction of the borrower is considered prior to issuing a loan. It is done as part of onboarding the borrower. If borrowers are incorporated in certain risky legal jurisdictions, based on factors such as ease of service of process and participation in international arbitration agreements, the borrower is not given access to the platform. Currently, the TrueFi team is performing this screening so these types of risky borrowers never even make a public loan application. In the future, as more parts of the platform are turned over to Community control, TrueFi holders could vote to allow borrowers from other legal jurisdictions to onboard. The borrower screening process also takes into account if the borrower has appointed an agent for service, and rewards borrowers for doing so.
Another safety measure that is built into the current process is the Master Loan Agreement that each borrower signs. Again, prior to being able to submit a loan request, each borrower signs the MLA by which they submit to arbitrate any dispute under the TrueFi’s choice of law, rather than require legal action in multiple different jurisdictions. In the next two fiscal quarters, the team plans to move the Loan Agreement to the public blockchain for even more transparency.
Finally, with regard to money laundering, every borrower on the TrueFi platform must undergo a full anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (in this case Know Your Business) review before being onboarded. That review is done by the same licensed Money Services Business team that onboard participants that use TUSD. Just as with TUSD, if a business can’t pass the AML/KYB review they can’t create an account and could never even create an account that would allow them to make a loan request.
Please let me know if this answers your legal questions.",26,5.2,2021-05-28

['[Discussion] Extending tfUSDC + tfTUSD farms / Adding tfUSDT?'],"Hi all, we’ve got another 7 days until the tfTUSD and tfUSDC farms end so wanted to open up two discussions:


Whether or not we should extend the tfUSDC and tfTUSD incentives


When we should consider adding tfUSDT?





The tfTUSD and tfUSDC farms have both done great at attracting new lending deposits. In 7 days, the rewards on both pools will revert from the boosted 290,934 TRU/day → 145,467 TRU/day. Would we like to extend these rewards at 290,934 TRU/day? Allow them to revert to 145,467 TRU/day? Or something else?


On tfUSDT, previously, Tyler had proposed that we wait until the tfUSDC pool hits at least >25% utilization before we consider adding USDT. Are we in agreement that that is the best course of action? If we added USDT there is the potential that would add another 50mm-100mm to TVL, however, if we can’t deploy that into new loans then we’re basically just paying out TRU (sorry if that’s a bit of a leading statement!)

['[Proposal] Partially refund accidental burns'],"Two seemingly unrelated pieces of background:
1: There is a large supply of unallocated incentive TRU. There is ongoing debate on whether some of it should be burned.
2: People frequently ‘burn’ TRU by accident. So far, as is the default in the crypto world, those folks have just been out of luck.
So I’m not sure of the exact details, but I propose that we use unallocated incentive TRU to partially reimburse people who accidentally burn their TRU. Effectively, whenever someone burns by accident, we would shoulder some of the burn. The unfortunate person who actually did the burn comes out happy (or rather, less sad - we would not be reimbursing them fully), and yet it arguably costs us nothing if we wanted to burn some tokens anyway.
If we completely ignore perception/optics for a moment, I think this is simply a moral thing to do. People are accidentally losing their money, and while it is true that it’s “their own problem” and crypto comes with no guardrails, that doesn’t mean it’s actually a good thing that people are losing their money. And assuming token burns are good for the protocol, then these poor fools who do so by accident are actually providing us a service; their actions have positive externalities. We’d simply now be allowing them to charge the protocol something for the service they’re providing - giving them a way to capture some (but not all) of the externalities they produced. Again, we are allowed to grab all these externalities for free (and that’s how everyone else does it), but that doesn’t mean it’s the right thing to do.
Now for meta-level stuff - perception, optics, precedent: …I’m not sure. I definitely have an instinctual “sounds like a dangerous precedent”, but I can’t really justify it. And for people who don’t yet know what’s going on, it might look bad for the incentive pool to be doing transfers to random-looking individual users. But there are surely optics upsides too. For one thing, to the extent that others agree with the object-level “it’s the right thing to do”, we then get the optics boost for doing the right thing. Also we probably get some positive attention simply for doing something that hasn’t (as far as I know) been done before. Ultimately, I don’t want to put too much weight here anyway; if we believe it’s the right thing overall and the right thing for the protocol, then I’d expect everything else to follow eventually.
Here’s a first draft at concrete implementation details; I’m not attached to any of these specifics but just wanted to give an idea of how it could work:
1- We allocate some amount of TRU (2mm?) from the unallocated incentives to a new ‘Guardrails Pool’
2- We whitelist certain specific transaction types that count as burning TRU. For example,

actually calling burn() on your TRU
sending your TRU to the TRU contract address

3- Someone who has accidentally burned TRU in one of these ways alerts us of this fact (google form? forum?), providing a tx hash.
4- We (the company?) review the tx, then send the address which originated the tx 50% as much TRU, paid from the Guardrails Pool. (There would also be a minimum deduction to cover the cost of our gas and our review time. So sufficiently small burns would end up reimbursed at a lower rate or not at all.)
The goal is to make this not gameable in any way - you can’t get a reimbursement without first losing significantly more than you will get back. Or if someone believes that burning their tokens one-for-one with incentive tokens will be more than compensated by the rising price of their remaining tokens, then… go ahead and try gaming it like that? I won’t join in but will happily accept the price boost.",36,57.2,2021-05-07

 rayanami:

There are 240mm TRU that are currently unallocated, so this proposal appears to be competing not with uses such as marketing and SAFU, but with “continue to sit unallocated”. And given the size of that pool, this would remain true even if some new proposals for tens of millions of dollars of marketing etc appeared. So it does not have to be the best use to be worth doing; I simply claim it is a good use.

I would propose that we authorize the company to review and approve individual requests. I don’t think “checking the block explorer for validity” is a real concern - isn’t Etherscan widely accepted to be trustworthy? And as long as refunds are processed only to the sender of the original tx, I don’t see how they would flow to the wrong users.



 rayanami:

First of all, I’m not a tax attorney but I’m not sure this is actually true - after all when in normal life you make a mistaken purchase and get a refund, that isn’t a taxable event, is it? But even if it is true, I don’t think it’s our problem - isn’t the standard that it’s on them to get their taxes right? I don’t see us worrying that farmers get their taxes right, or rather maybe we do worry but it doesn’t stop us from providing farming rewards.

What do you mean? In particular, what’s the money laundering concern that appears here but not in say farming?



 rayanami:

Ultimately I am making mostly a moral case here, and you don’t have to agree with the values or the weights I assign to them. But some values that are going in to this are:

I believe that it is a bad thing when people get hurt, even if no one else is at fault.
I believe that people should be paid for services they provide and positive externalities they produce.

There are also multiple ways to frame the same setup. For example, there is currently a line in the smart contracts which prevents users from sending to the zero address. So there are people who send to 0x0, and then by reverting the tx we refund to them not just 50% but the full 100%! Do you support removing this financial benefit for people who make typos? Just think, we could delete that line, and then there would be more accidental burns pumping up our token price, and as an added bonus we’d pay (a little) less gas on every transfer since there is one less line of code! But I think it’s reasonable for that line to remain as a guardrail against people hurting themselves by accident. And ultimately, I view this proposal as just a more complicated version of that line - people are hurting themselves, and instead of saying “sorry there’s nothing we can do” while pocketing the burn externalities, we have the power to make them not hurt themselves quite so much.",22,29.4,2021-05-08
['[Proposal] Partially refund accidental burns'],"Hi Benjamin,
Thank you for explaining!
I am a neophyte with crypto, though I’ve been studying a lot, and dipping in my toes.
You must be related to our founder Rafael, and I am very impressed with the transparency and honesty with which my investment in TrueFi has been handled. And it seems the way of the blockchain is very democratic.
But even in a democracy we need leaders, hopefully benevolent. I’m concerned when I see votes and discussions that just a handful of people respond. Am I missing something?
If most of the people are as uninformed as I, perhaps they don’t feel comfortable. In which case, we need some direction and discussion – as you have suggested here with the accidentally burned TRU tokens.
I just have this feeling I don’t know where TRU is headed, who is the driving force behind taking us there, and what the future is for TRU. I’ve been glad to have held on to my original $5000 (which was surprisingly offered back to me before final token issuance), because at today’s prices the tokens are worth roughly $18,000.
But I don’t know if I should swap for Ethereum (or even if I can). I just feel lost.

['[Proposal] Partially refund accidental burns'],"Hi Benjamin,
Thank you for the thoughtful and well-written reply.
I learned a lot from your post and, upon further reflection, now understand the merit of the proposal.  I’ll add a few thoughts inline.

There are 240mm TRU that are currently unallocated, so this proposal appears to be competing not with uses such as marketing and SAFU, but with “continue to sit unallocated”. And given the size of that pool, this would remain true even if some new proposals for tens of millions of dollars of marketing etc appeared. So it does not have to be the best use to be worth doing; I simply claim it is a good use.

This is a good point.  Though it would be great to see that unallocated TRU deployed for activities that enhance the protocol (SAFU, marketing, etc.), it is a separate topic from this proposal.

I would propose that we authorize the company to review and approve individual requests. I don’t think “checking the block explorer for validity” is a real concern - isn’t Etherscan widely accepted to be trustworthy? And as long as refunds are processed only to the sender of the original tx, I don’t see how they would flow to the wrong users.

What is meant by ‘checking the block explorer for validity’ is that when someone fills out a Google form that user may report that they sent transaction X to the TRU smart contract.  Someone needs to open Etherscan to confirm that transaction X exists, it was sent to the TRU contract, and that transaction X succeeded with a sufficient number of block confirmations.    Then that person needs to send a refund transaction at 50%, subtracting out the estimated gas cost and review cost.    For transparency, it would be great to have an Etherscan link that shows all of the refunds sent from the Guardrail Pool.

First of all, I’m not a tax attorney but I’m not sure this is actually true - after all when in normal life you make a mistaken purchase and get a refund, that isn’t a taxable event, is it? But even if it is true, I don’t think it’s our problem - isn’t the standard that it’s on them to get their taxes right? I don’t see us worrying that farmers get their taxes right, or rather maybe we do worry but it doesn’t stop us from providing farming rewards.

I would agree that handling taxes are not TRU’s problem.
Taxes depend on the user’s jurisdiction.  I am also not a tax lawyer and this is not tax advice but just my personal understanding - In the US, cryptocurrency is classified as property so it is not given the same tax treatment as fiat currency (USD).  So, in the US, purchasing a product with fiat is not a taxable event.  Returning that product is also not a taxable event.  However, purchasing a product with cryptocurrency is a taxable event (capital gains on the value change of the cryptocurrency above cost basis).  The most unintuitive thing is that ‘purchasing a product’ for 100 token and ‘returning that product’ for 100 token can also be a taxable event.  When we think in crypto terms there ought to be no change since it’s -100 token / +100 token for a net of 0 token.  However,  crypto is recorded in cost basis on fiat currency (USD) terms.  So if those 100 tokens were worth $5000 USD at the time the ‘purchase’ was made and worth $10000 USD at the time the 100 tokens are returned, this can be treated as a taxable event of capital gains $10k - $5k = $5000 USD.   Note this does not happen when transferring cryptocurrency between personal accounts (say from your wallet to Coinbase).  But when interacting with a smart contract belonging to a different entity, it is likely to apply.    See https://tokentax.co/guides/how-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency-is-taxed/ for more details.

What do you mean? In particular, what’s the money laundering concern that appears here but not in say farming?

I should clarify, there is increasing scrutiny regarding Anti Money Laundering for DeFi.  I think with this proposal there is no additional risk, it’s just one more thing that’ll require AML compliance, if TRU needs to take on an AML implementation in future years.
https://www.coindesk.com/fatfs-new-guidance

And ultimately, I view this proposal as just a more complicated version of that line - people are hurting themselves, and instead of saying “sorry there’s nothing we can do” while pocketing the burn externalities, we have the power to make them not hurt themselves quite so much.

Fair enough, it is true that when these mistakes happen it’s an unintentional burn at the expense of that user and to the benefit of TRU holders.  Giving a partial refund would be a nice and generous action on the part of TRU.

['Using EIP 1559 as a model for setting base interest rates'],"Our current system for setting interest rates is rather ad hoc. This creates confusion for borrowers who aren’t sure what to propose and combined with the natural slowness of decentralized governance can create a frustration experience for people trying to use the platform. With this in mind, I believe its critical we create a clear framework for setting interest rates that the team can apply automatically. I would like to start with a rough proposal for setting default interest rates solely based on utilization.
There are a few constraints for this framework.

It needs to be function transparently. Unlike Tradfi, customer can see(and participate in) lender discussions and our formulas.
Needs to approximate our target utilization with minimal manual input.
Provides clear expectations for lenders and borrowers.

The base-fee model used by 1559 fits all of these. It has a target utilization(50% for it), and increase or decreases fees on a set schedule based on utilization. For us, that could look more like “Target a utilization of 70-80%. Once a week, the base rate is increased or decreased based on utilization”.
I like this system as a base rate because it requires no external information or guesswork. We would need a separate variable for credit worthiness(which deserves its own discussion really). It may also be worth setting a minimum rate.",17,3.4,2021-05-25

First loan is a feeling out for both sides. It is most likely the highest risk we have with potential borrowers. So what if we made some set parameters for the first one or two loans, something like…
1st loan is to be $1million max with 20% fees
2nd loan up to $3million with 18% fees
3rd loan, make us a proposal with a hard minimum of 15% fees

['[Proposal] Growing Borrower Activity with TRU Incentives'],"Proposal:
Provide TRU rewards to borrowers in order to increase borrower activity on TrueFi, while maintaining high lender APYs and cultivating “loyalty.”
Background:
Though TrueFi has recently hit the $100m loans originated milestone, the rate of growth for new loans has slowed. It’s clear from borrower conversations that demand for new loans has reduced proportionally to the rise in interest rates.
As borrower activity is key to TrueFi’s short term (APYs) and long term (defensive moat) health, this proposal aims to incentivize new borrower applications and make our loans more attractive to existing borrowers.
Proposal: Borrower TRU Incentives
The following proposal aims to increase new borrower applications and new loan applications for existing borrowers while maintaining high lender APYs, and cultivating “loyalty” (through TRU token holdings & repayment histories) among borrowers.
This proposal requests 1m TRU from the TrueFi incentive pool to be allocated to borrowers who borrow the next $100m on TrueFi [see current TRU token allocations here]. Details below:

This incentive program is open to any new or existing borrowers.
Under this program, borrowers will receive incentives equal to 1% (100 basis points) of the principal loan amount. For example: $1mm loan would receive 10,000 TRU.
TRU Incentive on any one loan cannot exceed a maximum of 40,000 TRU ($4mm principal loan amount).
TRU Incentive is sent to the Borrower only upon successful loan repayment.
TRU Incentive program will end at the earlier of the next $100mm in funded loans (1mm TRU) or September 30th, 2021.
TRU Incentive program subject to early termination if the total ‘cost of debt’ net of TRU incentive is deemed too low based on prevailing market rates.
If approved, borrower incentives begin on approximately May 20th - at the same time [origination fees are slated to end].

Pros:


New/more lending activity: Lower rates will certainly help convert new borrowers to apply for whitelisting on TrueFi, as well as give us a tool to bring back existing borrowers who have refused new loans under current terms.

Attractive rates for borrowers and lenders: These incentives will help us convert more borrowers without directly reducing the rates of return enjoyed by lenders.

Incentive Alignment: Borrowers holding TRU make them invested in our success, possibly to the degree that they participate in TRU token markets or governance. Our borrowers holding TRU is also good optically.

Credit model becomes more valuable: Every loan is captured by TrueFi’s V1 credit model, which incorporates past TrueFi loan repayment activity. For borrowers, a robust TrueFi repayment history means better loan terms, which in turn means a greater likelihood of future borrowing - thus functioning as a sort of “loyalty” incentive.

Circulating TRU supply: This incentive would release only 1m TRU into the circulating supply over ~4 months, representing approximately 0.2% of the total incentive pool. See TRU treasury dashboard for details.

Considerations Regarding Borrowing on TrueFi:


Rising lending rates: Borrowing rates have risen almost 500 basis points in the last 3 months.

Higher DD friction: The new credit model process has increased the due diligence performed on borrowers, increasing some of the friction of signing up as a borrower (but making for arguably “safer” loans).

Below-Target Utilization: TUSD in the lending pool is currently sitting around 50% utilization, on a target of 70%. With new assets being added soon (~May 20th, V3 launch), TrueFi needs more loan requests to nurture a healthy marketplace.

Borrower Alternatives: TrueFi’s standard borrowers typically have access to a handful of other sources of funds, such as exchanges (which give lines of credit for little to no cost). At current rates, the “cost” (financial + time cost) of TrueFi is less competitive with other alternative sources of funding.

Lower utilization has the effect of forcing more loanable assets into Curve, lowering overall lender ROI, and undermining the growth of TrueFi. Building a healthy double-sided borrower/lender market is especially important now that more competitors are starting to enter the market.
At its core, TrueFi is a two-sided marketplace of lenders and borrowers - and a healthy, long-lasting relationship with borrowers is what really makes the platform valuable and defensible. Especially this early into the growth of the protocol and the on-chain credit sector as a whole, every single loan is valuable to building the strongest possible marketplace.
It’s for that reason we believe TRU incentives for borrowers aren’t just good for borrowers, but for lenders and TRU holders alike - and an integral part of moving towards larger, more regular loans as well as a robust, industry-accepted on-chain credit score built on TrueFi activity.
With that, would love to discuss this proposal further, and encourage you to vote:

YES, I support allotting 1m community TRU to this borrower incentive program
NO, I oppose the borrower incentive program

['[Proposal] Growing Borrower Activity with TRU Incentives'],"I support this, but the structure seems a little strange.

Tying it to the principal loan amount rather than [loan amount * duration] incentives shorter loans. Is this what we want? It seems that if we are having a hard time getting utilization up, then locking in more long term loans when able is to our advantage.
Why the 40,000 TRU limit? I’d love to see some larger loans from borrowers who have built up some trust, and I feel like this will unnecessarily discourage those.
What does this mean: “TRU Incentive program subject to early termination if the total ‘cost of debt’ net of TRU incentive is deemed too low based on prevailing market rates.”

In which case, they ought to sell any TRU they receive and use it for whatever purpose they took the loan for. This would put negative pressure on TRU price and be no better an incentive than just lowering interest rates 1%.
In fact, I would be concerned if our lenders weren’t selling their TRU. I have doubts about anyone who effectively takes out a 16% interest loan to buy TRU tokens.",40,38.0,2021-05-11
['[Proposal] Growing Borrower Activity with TRU Incentives'],"Hi Benjamin, great questions–
Duration: Actually at the moment for the safety of the protocol and to build repayment history/trust we’ve been leaning towards shorter term loans  for now. Regardless, because the borrowers are in many cases unwinding positions to repay they still prefer longer term loans. Of course, the hope is for this incentive program to drive utilization.
TRU Limit: One of our focus points in managing our loan portfolio risk is observing single borrower exposure limits as our credit analysis (via our credit model) continues to be refined. Currently, most of our loans will be limited in size such that the TRU incentive may not exceed 40,000 anyways. As we really hope to bring in new borrowers with this incentive they would certainly be limited on loan size until they’ve developed credit history with us. Further, we’d like to see that the incentive be spread across as many new borrowers as possible to continue to diversify our borrower base. If there is a desire to increase this TRU incentive beyond the 40k cap per loan down the road then certainly we can circle back to this and reevaluate.
Early Termination: This simply means that if the interest rate on new loans drops to a level at which it’s no longer necessary to offer the incentive then we have the ability to terminate this program.",40,43.0,2021-05-11

Over the years, I’ve had the opportunity to participate on teams that built portfolios of proprietary debt products and the common thread across the successful books were those that had counterparties that continued to stay with the institution because the relationship was constructive and mutually beneficial. Our borrowers are highly intelligent, savvy and tremendously helpful in originating new business for the protocol; as such, maintaining a long-term partnership with them will be critical to scaling our TrueFi loan portfolio.",38,42.6,2021-05-12
['[Proposal] Growing Borrower Activity with TRU Incentives'],"Thanks for the proposal Roshan. I support this as an initiative to regain the momentum we lost in borrowers activity but wouldnt want this to become a long term necessary workaround to justify having high enough APYs to keep our lenders happy. This seems to be the case in your proposal, so i fully support this.
@rattlecage I wouldnt worry about the selling pressure. We average approx 20M TRU traded on a daily basis and here we are talking about 1M TRU awarded over 120 days. On a daily basis this is 8k TRU over 20M traded, or 0.04% of the daily volume.
On another note, @RDharia , what do you think about a referral program for our borrowers, where when bringing new borrowers, you would get either 1) additional TRU, or 2) a small % of the APRs the new borrowers are paying, for their first x loans, or 3) a combination of those ?",38,42.6,2021-05-12
['[Proposal] Growing Borrower Activity with TRU Incentives'],"The community should accept lower APRs if there’s more competitive rates elsewhere. Convoluting the repayment price of a loan with token incentives seems to make things needlessly complicated for borrowers working out the cost of a loan, and for lenders.",36,97.2,2021-05-12
['[Proposal] Growing Borrower Activity with TRU Incentives'],"I completely agree with deif here, instead of diluting the TRU token in this manner, the stakeholders should just accept 1% lower APRs for the loans.
As a sidenote, if we really want to involve the TRU tokenomics in incentivizing borrowing, it should be done in a way that is beneficial for the parties with long term interest in the protocol. An example would be: borrower gets a 1% APR discount on the loan if they burn TRU for 0.5% of the loan value giving an effective ~0.5% discount.",36,52.2,2021-05-12
['[Proposal] Growing Borrower Activity with TRU Incentives'],"I second this, is there a strong argument against the community agreeing to lend out capital for cheaper to stay competitive, rather than a TRU token incentive structure?
I think the only argument I can think of is the one put forth by @RDharia, where putting TRU tokens in the hands of partners rewards them with equity which ideally aligns them with the interests of the platform in the long-term.",33,31.6,2021-05-13
['[Proposal] Growing Borrower Activity with TRU Incentives'],"Right now, i am leaning towards a YES on this proposal, but it’s not a strong yes.",32,11.4,2021-05-13
['[Proposal] Growing Borrower Activity with TRU Incentives'],"If I were a borrower, there is currently no incentive to hold the airdropped tokens and I would like to hear from a borrower first as to whether they would prefer lower APRs or governance tokens.

['[Proposal] Growing Borrower Activity with TRU Incentives'],"Yes, my view is that our base interest rate should reflect as accurately as possible the cost of capital to borrow on an unsecured basis (lenders’ required rate of return/yield). We’re establishing a benchmark as a protocol that others will look to as a comp rate somewhere between secured lending and equity returns. I believe that artificially manipulating this rate for business development reasons sets a difficult precedent particularly when we’re having direct discussions with borrowers and we’re being constantly challenged over our cost. If our base interest rate changes it should be transparent that the market perceives the yield does not accurately reflect the cost of lending sans collateral.",31,51.2,2021-05-13
['[Proposal] Growing Borrower Activity with TRU Incentives'],"Both of you make good points here. Yes, borrowers being airdropped these tokens as an incentive will sell these to lock in the realized savings on cost of borrowing.
However, as @RDharia says, the borrowing cost should reflect the market rate for cost of capital (a benchmark rate products compare themselves off similar to LIBOR/SOFR) and directly manipulating this rate for CAC can be very confusing. With this model, we are being very clear with “Hey this is the market rate for borrowing, BUT because we want to encourage lending on our platform, here is a TRU subsidy to make it more appealing for you to borrow with us”, rather than the alternative which could be seen as more opaque/confusing “We as a community are artificially manipulating our borrowing rate to encourage lending on our platform”",30,26.0,2021-05-13
['[Proposal] Growing Borrower Activity with TRU Incentives'],"You say you raise your eyebrows at this, but is this not how any early stage business works? Yes of course, your business should in the long run, be a better alternative to the incumbents, but at the early stages, you are spending capital(via diluting equity) to encourage borrowing to grow so that when you become as large as the incumbents, TrueFi will no longer need such extensive subsidies to prove the value of their lending product. I think we as TRU token holders need to accept dilution of our equity in the short term to ensure the platform can grow to the size it needs to for the long term benefit of TRU holders. We are still too early to be considering anything that discourages lenders/borrowers on our platform for the sake of equity holders.",29,20.8,2021-05-13
['[Proposal] Growing Borrower Activity with TRU Incentives'],"I fail to see how dropping borrowing rates to be more competitive is seen as artificially manipulating the rates. This is simply supply vs demand or am I missing something? If borrowers are put off from borrowing at the rates provided then that is clearly not the correct market rate.
Now if the lenders want their returns boosted then you should incentivise lending and not borrowing. After all, it is the lenders that have the incentive to see the platform succeed, not the borrowers.",29,25.8,2021-05-13
['[Proposal] Growing Borrower Activity with TRU Incentives'],"I did not formulate my thoughts correctly and probably should not have used the word “artificially manipulating”, more that separating borrower incentives from the market rate aligns with the protocol in the long term.
The team has already stated that they intend to have the protocol automatically set lending rates based on the market rate (how this will happen I do not know, perhaps polling from margin lending USDT rates from exchanges).
So to continue down this path of the community ad-hoc setting rates I don’t think aligns with where the project is going. We need to let the protocol decide the market rate for lending, and any incentives we provide to encourage lending/borrowing should be SEPARATE from this protocol market rate. I would also say to your point about lenders, we are inherently subsidizing lenders by maintaining their yield in spite of customer acquisition costs.",28,5.6,2021-05-13
['[Proposal] Growing Borrower Activity with TRU Incentives'],"Sell pressure is only half the issue. There is no advantage to this proposal over lowering rates 1% if people sell. Any competent borrower sells and doesn’t care about the future of Truefi, which is fine. Borrowers are here to borrow money and we should not expect them to be invested in the platform.
If we want to lower rates, we should lower rates. Thats going to attract borrowers better than giving them tokens they have to sell and forcing them to deal with additional gas fees or slippage. It would also be simpler and easier to track.",29,25.8,2021-05-13
['[Proposal] Growing Borrower Activity with TRU Incentives'],"I disagree with this, I doubt TrueFi borrower/lenders are as short-sighted as you make them out to be. Most borrowers and lenders do care about the future of this platform. We are still so early in the lifespan of this product, I would be surprised if most borrowers are making decisions to use TrueFi as a way to save a few bps off their borrowing costs.
Of course they take it into account for daily business operations, but by using the platform/earning equity, they are ultimately making an investment decision.  The appeal of TrueFi is not just lower borrowing costs, it is ideally a future where borrowers can access a reasonably priced source of undercollateralized credit not from a centralized financial institution. A future where entities that would not be able to obtain competitive borrowing rates from centralized institutions can rely on TrueFi as a relatively decentralized and more transparent source of credit.
If they did not care about the future of this platform, they would not be using it as they have, given TrueFi’s limitations in its current state. We need them to help grow the product and shape it around their feedback and needs. They may be selling their equity rewards to reap the borrowing cost benefits, but that does not mean they are not invested in the future of the platform.",30,41.0,2021-05-13

['[Proposal] New TRU Farming Incentives for Sushiswap LPs'],"Feb 2, 2021 Edit: It’s time to vote for this proposal on Snapshot!
As of writing, Sushiswap TRU liquidity is $1.3m, supported by SUSHI rewards on the Onsen Menu. There’s an opportunity to increase TRU volume on Sushiswap, which may help us reach a new audience of users, by opening Sushiswap farming incentives.
If we implement this before March, we should also be able to offer Sushiswap LPs double rewards: SUSHI from the Onsen Menu and TRU from TrueFi Sushiswap LP farming incentives - which would be a first. A key metric is adding new wallets holding TRU, with a goal of 2,500 (approx 1,840 now).
As TRU holders voted to decrease farming rewards in December, there’s ample tokens left in the pool of TRU tokens designated for growth and community incentives to create a new farm.
The poll below is designed to gauge sentiment for such a farm - exact token allocations will be modeled based on suggestions and sent to a community vote.
Some added context on each option:


YES to 1:1 farm: This vote suggests creating a brand new Sushiswap LP farm with the same TRU token allocation as the existing Uniswap farm of 50,541 TRU/day, increasing overall outgoing TRU.


YES to 50/50 migration: This vote suggests creating a brand new Sushiswap LP farm and migrating 50% of TRU incentives currently allocated to Uniswap to this new farm, keeping overall TRU farming outflows the same.


Alternative in Comments: Write your suggestion in the comments.


NO to new farm: This vote stands against a new Sushiswap farm.


EDIT Jan 24: Based on the substantive discussion in this post, a fairly widely endorsed option not originally listed in the poll - a 100% Uniswap → Sushiswap migration - is being considered. As there is no way to edit the poll without voiding the results, a new poll may be launched or the alternative may move directly to a Snapshot vote unless there’s explicit opposition.

['[Proposal] New TRU Farming Incentives for Sushiswap LPs'],"I’m voting some kind of yes. However, the two existing YES options both end up with the same number of TRU/day allocated to Uniswap and Sushiswap farms. Since the Sushiswap farm is already incentivized by the Onsen rewards, might it make sense to allocate somewhat less TRU/day to it? I don’t have an exact number in mind,  nor do I have a strong opinion on new rewards vs migration, but e.g. maybe a 40/60 migration or something?",49,74.8,2021-01-20

as a LP, I really only care about APY.  If the APY is high enough, I will close my eyes and jump in hoping that the APY will justify any large IL risk.
The Sushiswap pool is small right now and the slippage is HUGE.  Here’s a chance to really get people motivated to become LP on Sushi for the next 27 days.  If after the Onsen rewards end in 27 days, the price of TRU appreciates enough and the TRU farm rewards on Sushi are still pretty good, I might not pull my liquidity out.  I may continue to supply liquidity on Sushi.   But if after the onsen rewards are gone, and my rewards are worse than those on UNI, I will DEFINITELY withdraw my liquidity on Sushi and stake them on UNI since it has higher yields.  So the net gain is some added liquidity on Sushi for 27 days and then everyone withdraws their liquidity or moves over to UNI – defeating the purpose of the stacked rewards in the first place.  It becomes a wasted opportunity, IMO – since these Onsen Sushi rewards are only for a limited time.",46,44.2,2021-01-20

If we want to increase TUSD in the pool, I’d suggest the community (a) become more aggressive in demanding a higher loan APY from borrowers (absolutely fair considering the ROI available in the market). For (b), I am personally not for growing TRU incentives for TUSD lenders at this time.
Farming incentives (which come built-in with marketing to the community we’d support) are a fantastic way to get more eyes on the protocol (and specifically, the pool ROI), while more distinct wallet holders improve quality of partnership conversations.",37,17.4,2021-01-22

If we incentivize both farms (UNI+Sushi) they will not be as inclined to co-market this double dip yield opportunity.

['[Proposal] New TRU Farming Incentives for Sushiswap LPs'],"Hello community- I’m strongly against a 1:1 farm, which right now seems to be the most popular option.
Right now I believe the protocol is massively over-paying and getting very little in return. For example, the TFI-LP farm is paying 59% APY on $27mm of capital in the TFI-LP farm. This is a rate of ~$15.9mm per year and this ultimately comes out as reduced TRU token price as these TRU tokens hit the market. Are these LPs providing $15.9mm of value over the next year by putting their $27mm into the lending pool? I think not. Are they providing $1-3mm of value? Probably.
image1050×400 34.7 KB
Here’s another way to think of it: if you lend me $27mm, and I pay you $15.9mm/year in interest, that’s what you’d call taking advantage of a sucker.
Note also that the protocol is experiencing severe inelasticity in the supply of capital. The APY on several of the farms actually increased significantly as TRU token price grew from ~12c to ~24c, but has this brought new capital into the protocol? Very little. Lending pool TVL has been close to flat between 30-35mm for a while now. I think our best bets for bringing new capital into the protocol are things like adding USDC support, not paying higher APY on the farms.
Trying to compete with the latest ultra-high APYs in DeFi is a fools errand and no serious protocol attempts to do this for a significant amount of time- it’s attempting to defy financial gravity. Serious protocols like Compound are paying reasonable interest rates on their farms and that’s what we should be targeting.
I see creating a new 1:1 farm as a way to pay even more and continue to get very little. We’re renting capital at extortionary rates, and for what? Why should we rent more?
I would be OK with migrating half of the rewards over, assuming we can also migrate a proportional amount of our corporate capital over and continue farming-and-burning TRU as we have been. This burning reduces TRU supply which ultimately benefits TRU holders. I think reducing TRU emissions would actually be better than a migration, but at least a migration would not make the situation worse by increasing emissions.",41,193.2,2021-01-22
['[Proposal] New TRU Farming Incentives for Sushiswap LPs'],"I agree with this and migrating half the rewards to the sushiswap is the best idea. We don’t need to compete with exorbitant rates as current rates of TFI-LP are enough to attract capital. For uniswap and sushiswap pool, it will only add to sell pressure since folks farming will sell immediately
I think the right way is to incentivize lending to TFI-LP pool which I created a post about. Incentizing sushiswap doesn’t add value to the project at all. Early on incentives for uniswap made sense to create liquidity, but we don’t need to keep adding this free token emission at the highest rate possible.",38,22.6,2021-01-22

['[Proposal] New TRU Farming Incentives for Sushiswap LPs'],"I think at the root of the disagreement here is “what are farming incentives for,” or at least which one are we optimizing around:
(A) decreasing slippage on DEXs (a service ideally attained at lowest cost)
(B) to grow # of individuals holding TRU  (a service to them, ultimately enriching them, but also roping some portion of LPs into our community as active players).
What percentage of LPs ultimately hold the token is not known, but is roughly tied to their sense of the future promise of TrueFi - which I’d argue is fairly compelling, especially once the 2021 roadmap is published.
A suggestion by @Jacks with which I agree is a total migration of farming rewards from Uniswap to Sushiswap.
It allows us to meet BOTH priorities:
(A) Migrating the farm keeps total TRU farming outflows the same, therefore keeping TRU price from depressing at a faster rate. It would also expedite the setup of TFI-LP pools by winning us favor with their team.
(B) It would allow us to reach the new Sushiswap audience with a robust farming offer - further boosted by SUSHI awards on the Onsen, which would attract more attention considering the total APY would be high enough to compensate more of the impermanent loss.
Uniswap liquidity is already strong and with centralized listings is not be vital to trading nor price discovery. The farm has also run long enough that whatever audience we’d have reached on Uniswap has been tapped. Neither is the case for Sushiswap.
Furthermore, a full migration would definitely raise the marketing Sushiswap would put behind TrueFi. They’re huge in the DeFi degen community, who would be good partners to making TrueFi better.",40,98.0,2021-01-22

If your goal is to increase # of TRU holders, this is easily achieved through an airdrop, why make this more complex than it has to be? Just name the number of holders you want to have and we can make it so. An airdrop isn’t super attractive because it’s clear that we’re giving away TRU and potentially getting relatively little in return, a farm is a good way to disguise this fact by making the mechanism more complex.
To be clear I’m not advocating for killing the farms, just bringing their APYs closer to e.g. Compound’s farms.

['[Proposal] Pancakeswap Liquidity Pool'],"Hi TrueFi,
I propose applying for a liquidity farm and Syrup Pool to PancakeSwap for BNB<->TRU.
The main benefit of this proposal is that users would be able to trade TRU on Binance Smart Chain (with much lower gas fees compared to Ethereum).  This benefits TRU holders with increased liquidity, lower trading fees, and fast trade confirmations.  This also benefits the TrueFi ecosystem as it increases Binance user awareness of TrueFi.
At present time there is $7.5B locked on PancakeSwap compared to $5.8B on Uniswap and $4.1B on Sushiswap.  If more TRU is locked into liquidity farms in PancakeSwap, it may also have a positive impact on TRU price.
Some risks with this proposal -
(1) more complexity, users need to understand the difference between Ethereum chain and Binance Smart Chain and how to Binance Bridge assets across. In particular, all of TrueFi only supports Ethereum chain so if users want to interact with TrueFi they have to bridge their BEP-20 back to ERC-20.
(2) Binance Smart Chain is relatively centralized and users must rely on Binance Bridge or the Binance exchange in order to convert to other crypto or fiat.

['Secure Asset Fund for Lenders (Similar to SAFU)'],"Hello Community,
Personally I think TrustToken has built a brand around Trust with their fiat implementations (TUSD, TCAD etc), TrueFi and how open the team is to listen to the community. In order to continue building this trust, I think something like a SAFU built into the protocol will help.
Having such a fund built into the protocol will:

Help in winning lenders’ trust and onboard more lenders and therefore more loans can be given out.
Help in winning investors’ trust and therefore help in maintaining the value of TRU in case of a loan default.

How can we achieve this?
I was discussing this with @ryan.rodenbaugh and i understood that the company is still deciding what to do with the next rounds of company’s TRU unlocks (54,360,866 in Nov 2021 and another 54,360,866 in Nov 2022).
Few ideas for the fund:

May be TrustToken can decide to allocate some portion of the company’s TRU towards the fund.
A part of loan APY can go towards this fund.
A part of TFI-LP farming APY can go towards this fund.

Thoughts?",53,255.6,2021-02-09
['Secure Asset Fund for Lenders (Similar to SAFU)'],"Great proposal and one we definitely need to become a trusted lender.  As mentioned here
a) The current company unlocked tokens stand at around 15 million USD (54 million) which is still lower than the amount of loan volumes TrueFi is doing. In my opinion, at least 80% or around 12 million USD (42 million tokens) should be added to SAFU insurance which will be around 20% of the current loan volume which is a good number to start with. Rest of the company funds unlocked tokens should be also allocated in this way (80% of each unlock). This will reduce the maximum circulation supply by locking funds into the insurance fund by ~ 120 million tokens as these will be reserved for SAFU pool, and bring around 36million liquidity in USD at current rate. In my opinion, this is the best way to utilize the company funds towards assuring lenders as well as TRU holders who will have more confidence staking their TRU or providing liquidity to tfUSD, and since idea of company funds is to better serve the TrueFi product, this is the best way to use them
b) A portion of TRU emission from both sushiswap and tfUSD pools should be added to the SAFU funds. These pools have one of the highest emissions and have a responsibility to atleast benefit TrueFi lenders and platform in some way. In my head, that is by directing a part of rewards to the TRU insurance fund. I think this return is justified as market makers are still getting a good APY but a part of rewards are being used to insure them indirectly as if TrueFi undergoes a default, TRU price suffers and Marketmakers incur huge losses. Hence for them to pay a reasonable fee to insure the TRU protocol only makes sense. This also reduces the emission of TRU slightly but as Sushi token rewards are being added the net APY won’t go down much.
c) A portion of Governance Stake TRU rewards should be added to the SAFU pool, I think this is what AAVE does and makes sense to contribute a part of governance rewards to insurance funds. We can have the TRU rewards contributed to SAFU not have a vesting cycle as they are only going to be used in emergency situation, and the rest of the TRU rewards for takers be vested (as we are discussing increasing emission for TRU by 16x for governance model)

we simply have too many coins outstanding, the tokenomics are obviously a legacy from the old Trust Token and equity with token model.  Two of us have tried to pitch the coin to a sell-side research firm and were given somewhat lukewarm feedback, basically confusing tokenomics with too many coins outstanding.   From what I’m gathering a lot of Defi is starting to trade at a multiple of TVL, around 3x on average let’s say, so if our expectation is that we’ll have 200mm coins circulating let’s say, and $100m in TVL by the end of March with the Sushiswap launch, then we’re talking about a $1 coin price and we want to shoot for higher than that, $2 or $5 in the next 3 to 6 months, if possible.  If we don’t get rid of some of the dilution than the coin price never increases or goes down b/c the coins are growing faster than our growth.  Coinmarketcap has added this metric (price /tvl) to their main company profile so I think investors are starting to look at it…

The dividend idea is great to help the token value but it’s a band-aid on a gaping gash.  Most other DeFi lenders are taking on more risk but also providing an insurance fund and/or compensating for that risk.  Alpha is offering leverage on their loans and has $1b closed in the past month.  We’ve already dropped from 24 to 30 on Defi Pulse and we’re going to be at 35 soon.  I don’t know enough about the sector but I do know that others are doing this and it’s working for them.  After all, I keep on seeing the same questions popping up on Discord: why isn’t there an insurance fund? what happens if the lender defaults?  So obviously people want to stake but the risk/reward compensation isn’t even close to where it needs to be.  It’s time for some major change, the market is scorching hot right now and this won’t last forever.  We have a chance to fix these issues while all eyes are upon us.


I’d be interested to hear the thoughts of @rafaelcosman and @Jacks",46,64.2,2021-02-10
['Secure Asset Fund for Lenders (Similar to SAFU)'],"Hey Orion,
I already proposed some ideas to both Ryan and Rafael about risk tranching.  I suggested working with Saffron Finance to create different tranches of risk for the uncollateralized loans.  This is a perfect match, IMO.
While this may take some time, a SAFU fund would be a nice first step before risk tranching can be implemented.  So I fully support a SAFU fund as well.
As for tokenomics and dilution – completely agree with you there.  The unlocks will create major sell pressure on the coin.  Unless we grow the TVL at a much faster pace, the TRU token is going to face some major resistance.  I don’t know what the right fix is for the high upcoming inflation (unlocks).  One suggestion that was floated out was to have the company buy back TRU with the fees from the loans.  I don’t think that, by itself, will do the trick.  It will be too slow.
Another idea is to create a HODL fund where people who are long-term holders of TRU could deposit their TRU into this HODL fund.  The advantages of putting TRU into this HODL fund might be:

more % of the fees
more voting power (maybe 2x the votes of a normal TRU vote)
maybe some bonus TRU for putting it there.
minimum 1 year lockup (or some pre-determined time frame.

I’ve seen something like this done on Saffron and I think it’s a great idea.   Maybe we can do this here as well. Will definitely help with the unlock/inflation problem.

['Secure Asset Fund for Lenders (Similar to SAFU)'],"I’m wondering if a better alternative to a SAFU could be simply to allocate tokens to a treasury managed by governance.

A better alternative. could be to use this governance fund in any way TRU holders see fit. This could cover litigation against borrowers that default, or straight out paying the lending pool if there is a default. I think a SAFU fund that automatically pays out on defaults doesn’t make sense if we have staking. Rather, we should act more like Nexus Mutual, where TRU holders decide outright if it’s worth repaying lenders for a default, and for how much. In addition to the automatic payout from staking, this should be more than sufficient to compensate lenders in the case of defaults, exploits, etc.
Let me know what you all think.",31,46.2,2021-02-15
['Receive TRU for Approval'],"Hi,
Im not sure I understood properly the video on your home page that showed how TRU works.
Those that hold TRU decide if a loan should be given or not. If you choose YES then there is a chance that you will receive tokens for the approval but if you say NO then you won’t.
Isn’t the preference then to say YES to everything in the hope of getting tokens without necessarily looking at the safety of  the loan itself? And would this not create an unsafe lending platform for those providing the loans?
Sorry, just came across the token today so I am reviewing it for long term HODL",25,35.0,2021-05-05
['Receive TRU for Approval'],"There are several reasons you might want to vote NO:

You think the loan will actually default. Then you should stop the loan by voting NO, because otherwise when it gets approved and then defaults, up to 10% of your staked TRU will be slashed to compensate lenders.
You think the loan is not competitive. Then you should vote NO so that the protocol keeps the money on hand to offer instead to someone offering better rates. (You do directly get more rewards for approving loans with better rates, so it’s in your interest as well as the lenders’.)

So all in all, the voting system mostly incentivizes you to do the right thing - vote yes on safer, higher-value loans, and no on sketchy or lowball loans.

['[Idea] Boosting incentives for tfUSDC launch'],"
Summary
TrueFi is ready to launch new lending pools this month as part of the roadmap’s Phase 3 rollout.


tfUSDC will be the first new lending pool to launch.

tfUSDT is expected to launch 2-6 weeks later, once tfUSDC utilization rate is >25% and the community supports moving forward with launching another lending pool.

This post proposes (a) creating farms for the new lending pools, (b) and boosting farms and TRU staking incentives to drive rapid growth in these new pools.

Proposal
The objectives of this proposal are to double total value locked (increase to ~$200M TVL) and to generate >$60M in new loans by end of June, using the following levers:
i. Create new farms and boost tfUSDC and tfTUSD emissions for 14 days following launch:

Create a tfUSDC farm w/ daily emissions of 290,934 TRU / day

Boost the tfTUSD farm daily emissions 2x from 145,467 to 290,934 TRU / day

Time period:

Boosted emissions run for 14 day period, starting when tfUSDC launches
After 14 days, emissions will revert to 145,467 TRU / day unless extended by governance.


The success of this campaign will inform our approach to incentivizing the launch of the tfUSDT lending pool, which will be a separate discussion/poll.

ii. Increase TRU staking emissions 25% to encourage new TrueFi participants to stake their TRU rewards:

Increase stkTRU daily emissions from 100,000 to 125,000 TRU / day
This aims to maintain current ~50% staking APR for 100M TRU staked
Emissions run for 90 days, to be revisited by governance before Phase 4

Proposed total emissions increase vs. current:

14 day launch period: 461,401 additional TRU / day
Day 15 - Day 90: 170,467 additional TRU / day


Rationale

Adding new assets is a massive opportunity to grow TrueFi

TrueFi has grown from $0 to ~$100M TVL w/ only TrueUSD  which has had ~$500M in avg. circulating supply during TrueFi’s lifetime
New assets represent >$65bn in circulating supply

USDC supply = $15bn, USDT supply = >$50bn




As lending pool sizes grow, staked TRU should grow too

stkTRU provides default protection for lenders and builds confidence that TrueFi can weather one or more defaulted loans
HODL and stake:

As new lenders collect TRU rewards, staking incentives can attract users to get involved in TrueFi staking and governance
Staking rewards should be competitive with Sushiswap TRU/ETH returns; in my opinion, stkTRU APY should be higher than Sushi’s because staking delivers more value to our ecosystem than LPing





Now feels like the right time


Draw our line in the sand: We’re opening up TrueFi to a huge swath of new users; let’s seize the opportunity and stake our claim as lending platform of choice for DeFi summer pt. 2 


Improve TRU fundamentals: New pools can generate lasting loan activity and protocol fees for TrueFi

We have the means: TRU token supply has >500mm remaining TRU allocated to incentives.

['[Idea] Boosting incentives for tfUSDC launch'],"Hello all, new guy here and have some questions.


When the new pool is live I suspect you can not move coins from one pool to the next?


After the first 14 days with 100% ROI, the pools level out to the same 50%. What is the incentive for existing members to stay in the old pool for the first 14 days?


I have just purchased more TRU to stake but it looks like I need to keep it off the site and unlock what I have staked to join the new pool and maximize return when it goes live?


Should the existing user base already investing in the LP get incentive to not defund the pool and move to the new one?


I am new to crypto and am glad I found this community. I am just struggling to see why the existing pool would not deflate from members pulling funds to capitalize on the new pool. I assume the goal is to be staked in all pools. Maybe some thought needs to go into rewards during the new pool integration to keep existing funds and pools stable. Maybe and most likely, I am missing something?

['[Idea] Boosting incentives for tfUSDC launch'],"Hey @Rockgolfer – welcome to the forum, here are responses to your questions:

Lenders can move from one pool to the other
I expect that some lenders will move from tfTUSD to tfUSDC until ROIs stabilize. The only thing keeping existing lenders in tfTUSD is the pool currently has ~30M loans out, so ~50% is liquid today.
Current stakers will get the 25% boost on TRU staking rewards. The increased rewards will flow through the same staking contract. If you stake TRU today, you’ll receive the increase staking rewards without having to move pools. (Is this what you were asking?)
It’s a good question – I’m actually ok with current lenders moving from one fund to the other. My thinking is (i) tfUSDC could be our largest pool long term, so I think its incentives should be on par with tfTUSD’s, (ii) liquidity is a feature lenders value on TrueFi and I don’t want to constrain lenders’ ability to exit pools when they wish – it can be a win-win because liquid exit generates fees for the rest of the lenders. I expect some funds to move from tfTUSD to tfUSDC chasing high yields right after launch, but I think more new TUSD and USDC will flow into TrueFi til ROIs on both pools return <100%.

This might be borderline off topic but I have one lingering thought/question… I see a huge drawback to crypto(something I had to dedicate a lot of time to try and overcome myself) is the ease of entering and using individual projects in the crypto community as a whole. With the idea of future growth and no knowledge from an advanced educated standpoint, why create separate pools at all?

You’re right – there’s a big learning curve to use any DeFi app and there’s certainly more we want to do to make TrueFi easier to use. The tfUSDC pool should make TrueFi much easier for users who have USDC – now they can come straight to app.truefi.io and deposit USDC to get started.
This helps us reach the large audience of USDC users in our current setup.

Our crypto genesis story begins before DeFi; at the very dawn of CeFi, when Binance was but a glint in CZ’s eyes and Ether a whisper in the wind. We go back yet further, spanning crypto winters and frenzied peaks alike. We venture out to a mythical place far away; from the western lowlands we go beyond Asia to face Mt. Gox. Ruled by a strange French king it was the highest mountain in the land. We set out to traverse the dangerous crevasses, a ruthless quest too harsh to bear for many. As we passed frozen bodies of the fallen, we continued tirelessly and strengthened our resolve.
But this is not the tale of Mt. Gox - a story we all know too well; one we reminisce on with grimaced faces around campfires once the young have gone to bed. This is the story of a crypto world that phoenixed from the ashes and the trading firm that came along with it. From its humble beginnings as the creator of Gekko, a now famous story from a time long passed, yet ever popular amongst the finest craftsman on Github; to Agent Smith, an arbitrage bot trading billion dollar volume on Poloniex in 2017; and finally culminating in FOLKVANG.

['Eliminate Origination Fee for Cut of Returns Instead'],"Want to get feedback on eliminating the origination fees in exchange for stakers getting a % of the yield? (kind of like a ‘performance fee’)
I believe this is important because this would help us to increase our “headline rates"" and make the pool more appealing to depositors.
It’s also more in line with what other projects do (e.g., yEarn has a great discussion on performance fees here)
To make this more concrete, in Bastion recent loan request, they asked for “1,000,000 for a 30 days loan at a rate of 14.5% annualized”. This means they will pay 12,083 in yield to lenders + 2,500 TUSD origination fee, meaning that the rate they’re actually paying is 17.5% (0.1749967)
(hope my math is right)
I’d like to discuss two things on this thread:

Do people agree this is a good switch to make?
What fee should be charged on the returns? My rough sense is that, to start, the fee should not be high to begin (prioritizing growth rather than fees) as we need to attract more capital to the pool. Assuming deposits in the pool continue to grow, we can discuss upping the fee at a later milestone.

Feedback welcome, please.",44,118.8,2021-02-19
['Eliminate Origination Fee for Cut of Returns Instead'],"Thanks @ryan.rodenbaugh. I fully support this, particularly because of your point on the headline rate!
With regards to the fee that should be charged, I also agree that we should start with a rather low fee.
My understanding is that for now we charge 0.25% regardless of the duration of the loan? That would equate to a 3% annualized fee for 30 days loans, or 1.5% for 60 days loans, 1% for 90 days…
I would suggest to start with a 1.5- 2% fee which seem to be on the low end of what is done in the market, but i am no expert, so happy to challenge this…
Anyone else? thoughts?",46,14.2,2021-02-19
['Eliminate Origination Fee for Cut of Returns Instead'],"If the origination fee goes away and TRU stakers instead receive 2% of the loan APY, here is my understanding -
Assuming that deposits reach $50m TUSD and this amount is lent for the full year, the 2% return to TRU stakers would be $1m.  There are currently about 27m TRU staked and if we assume a value of $0.50 per TRU, that means the annual return for the TRU stakers would be $1m / (27m * 0.50) = 7.4%.   For comparison, stakers in the AAVE security module get 5.9% APY but can also face a maximum slashing of 30% (compared to 10% for TRU).
Naturally, as Total Value Lent (TVL) increases, the APY for TRU stakers would increase.  If deposits & lending reaches $200m TUSD then the APY for TRU stakers would rise to 29.6%.  It would then make sense to see TRU token value itself increase as either (1) more users will stake TRU to get yield, causing lower supply and/or (2) more users will buy TRU to stake, causing higher demand.

Now, I understand the unique differentiator of TrueFi is for 0% fully uncollateralized lending.  That said, it could be interesting to explore the idea of partial collateralized lending - borrowers purchasing TRU to reduce the interest rate paid.  For an analogy in the real world, real estate mortgages often allow borrowers to reduce long-term interest rate in exchange for cash up front.  How this might work is a borrower uses staked TRU as collateral, and in the event of a default the borrower TRU is completely slashed before other TRU stakers get slashed.  This allows borrowers to lower their interest rates by providing partial TRU collateral.  Borrowers can also get governance rights on their TRU.  For the protocol, this promotes decentralization as borrowers now have an incentive to buy TRU.  For TRU holders, this would be positive price pressure as borrowers buy TRU, locking up more supply.   It’s also more safety as borrowers now have more ‘skin in the game’ to not default.  Essentially instead of 0% collateral (TrueFi) and 100+% over-collateral (AAVE), it now allows loans in the in-between 0 to 100 space.   Of course this feature only makes sense for long-term / frequent borrowers so perhaps may be worth consideration with the upcoming Lines of Credit feature for trusted borrowers.
The above is a naive thought experiment and it’s worth calling out there are many gaps that are unsolved upon deeper consideration.  For example, if a borrower wants to 50% collateral a loan with TRU, but then TRU value doubles during the course of their loan they’ve now effectively put 100% collateral on their loan (they’re probably still happy because their TRU collateral doubled).  In converse, if TRU value halves then the loan interest rate discount would decrease until the borrower puts in more collateral.  This could be a poor user experience.  Also, if borrowers aren’t interested in discounts on loan interest rates in exchange for collateral, this could be a waste of valuable engineering time.  Further, it can make understanding TRU + marketing that much more complex.",44,228.8,2021-02-20

['Eliminate Origination Fee for Cut of Returns Instead'],"Love this discussion, and especially love the @rayanami idea of allowing partial collateralization with TRU. That probably deserves its own thread.
Back on the origination fee. I agree with elimination, both for transparency and for headline rates.  My suggestion would be rather than a fixed APY paid to the stakers, it should be something like 10% of the loan APY. This aligns the incentives of the stakers (who will also be the loan raters) and the lenders. My worry is if it’s 1.5% or 2% fixed APY, then stakers will be tempted to approve lower APY and larger loans because they get the same origination fee, even though long-term it might cause lenders to shy away. And if we keep the loan APYs up in the 15-20% range, then the outcome is roughly the same.

['Coined Borrower Request #1'],"Hello TrueFi Community,
My name is Thomas Alvord. I’m the President of Coined, which is a privately held family crypto company.  We have 8 figures in AUM.
We would like to borrow $3MM  for 60 days at 16%.  Assuming things go well, we would hope to continue working with TrueFi long term.
The money would be exclusively used for arbitrage between spot and futures. We would be market-neutral, being long and short BTC in equal amounts. Thus, we are fully-hedged and safe from any BTC price movements. We would place the borrowed funds and execute the trades in an account separate from our other holdings and trades.
We can provide a private URL at coined.com where the TrueFi community could check the account balance at any time. In addition, we can provide the exchange api endpoints so the TrueFi community can verify the account balance directly with the exchange. This would be a read-only api key to the exchange account that allows you to verify the balance at any time.
(On a side note it would be interesting to integrate the account balance as reported by a read-only exchange api with TrueFi as an added layer to verify loaned funds. I imagine this would be limited to borrowers who are able or comfortable doing this.)
In terms of a little background about me. I’m the co-founder and chairman of Funded Today, where we have helped generate $300 million+ in revenue for start ups over the past 7 years. We were #27 on the Inc 5000 a few years ago. I am also the founder of LawHQ, which is a tech-focused law firm. We have an iPhone/Android app that let’s people report spam. We then track down and sue the spammers. We already have over $500 million in filed lawsuits against telephone spammers. (In the U.S. every spam call can be up to $3,000 in damages under federal law.)
Lastly, I’ll note that in 2018, I started using the brand Coined in an effort to create crypto indices and tokenized index funds. You can see one of my interviews at the 2018 Vanfunding crypto conference in the comments below. For various reasons, we didn’t continue pursuing the crypto indices and tokenized funds. However, we’ve continued using Coined as a private crypto trading and investment company with great success. To expand on that success, we look forward to hopefully working with TrueFi.
I am happy to answer any questions anyone may have.

About the Borrower Requests category Borrower Requests


    This category is used for Borrowers that are planning to request a loan from the TrueFi protocol and want to share information with the community and engage with lenders and stakers. 
As we go through the ‘progressive decentralization’ process, some things such as this whitelist and loan agreement will be in place for early versions of the TrueFi protocol. 
Over time, this will move towards greater decentralization.

['How to Handle Protocol Fees in Multi-Asset'],"(Copying and pasting Raf’s message from Discord to the forum for easier discussion. You can find the original conversation in the #general channel in our Discord. Link here)
We have a protocol decision we need to make this week to keep the eng team unblocked
Basically, once we add multi-asset, how do we want to pay out staking fees?
Right now staking fees are paid out in tfTUSD because TUSD is the only asset on the platform
But in the future, we don’t want people to get a little tfBTC, tfETH, tfUSDC, tfTUSD, etc. because it’ll be too many tokens
Gas cost will be very high with so many tokens
So the main options we’re considering are:

Sell everything for a single asset e.g. tfUSDC
Sell everything for TRU

I’m leaning a bit towards selling everything for tfUSDC because I think it’s valuable for us to pay out stable coin rewards for staking TRU. If staking TRU only gets you more TRU (and not stablecoin) then it becomes more difficult to explain the utility of TRU. We’d have to say ‘the value of TRU is you can stake it and get more TRU’ (which feels to people like circular logic) vs ‘the value of TRU is you can stake it and get stablecoin’ (much simpler to understand the value)
Note: this would only impact origination fees, not TRU incentives/rewards that stakers also receive.",23,29.6,2021-04-07
['How to Handle Protocol Fees in Multi-Asset'],"As a principle I didn’t expect TrueFi proposition to be offering finance on anything other than stables, mainly USD.
Stables for a single token makes sense as all relatively “stable” and pegged so fluctuations are minimal.
Short term fix so devs can move forward, while creating the framework for multi asset.
Community can chew over what adding other assets mean for the service and how that could/should be structured, I think more volatile assets should be treated as a separate discussion so not to complicate dev work.",19,3.8,2021-04-07

I founded Kbit in 2017 and most recently before that I worked as the Director of Trading Technology at Citadel. Kbit has been performing spot market making and high-frequency strategies in the crypto space since 2017 and we are active on most of the large crypto spot markets.
To start our borrowing relationship, we are looking to borrow $1mm for 60-days at 16.0%.
Our trading strategy is fully automated and runs 24/7/365. We capture repeatable sources of alpha including from the bid/offer spread, short-term price fluctuations caused by supply/demand imbalances, and sustained dislocations resulting in arbitrage opportunities. We’ve been consistently profitable since 2017 in up and down markets.
We’ve been working directly with the TrustToken team since 2019, first as a dedicated market maker on TUSD and now on both TUSD and TRU. If you’ve bought or sold TRU on a centralized exchange, there’s a good chance we were on the other side of that trade.

1-Where do you get up to date news about this stuff.  I always just search online and find out on Twitter? The website I visit is just the TrueFi site with the app, and I never see info there.
2-I currently have my TRU staked on the app.  Do I need to unstake my TRU to exchange the ERC-20 for the BEP-20 token?
3-Will both tokens stay in circulation or do I need to exchange?
4-Is there an option for people in the USA to exchange the TRU token or can you only do it at Binance?
5-Where can I obtain the TRU wallet? I’ve seen it talked about on Twitter, but I can’t find it.
6-What exchanges can you trade the new TRU BEP-20 token
7-Where can I find the information on the TRU-BEP-20 token, so I can add the token to my meta mask wallet?
8-Will I be able to stake the new token as well?
I have limited knowledge of crypto, so these things can be tough for me and I appreciate  your help.
9- Over all, do I need to even exchange the TRU ERC-20 token for the BEP-20 Token?  Will the ERC-20 be taken out of circulation eventually or anything? What is the reason for the BEP-20 token?
10-Sorry for all the questions.  I’m excited by the idea of their being a TRU BEP-20 token because I think that will lower gas fees.  Right now I stake about 17k TRU ERC-20 tokens, which is worth it, but it’s not worth it to claim the rewards and stake then often.  I believe it would be way better if I could do that with the TRU BEP-20 token. I just can’t find information on this.  Right now I’m worried that if I unstake my TRU I will be given the TRU BEP-20 token and that my connected wallet won’t be able to hold it.  If I unstake my tru, will I receive the ERC-20 or BEP-20?
11- If I unstake my TRU ERC-20 and exchange it for the TRU BEP-20, will I be able to stake that and what is the best wallet to do that?  I am in the US. I really want to do this if the fees are lower.  I just want to make sure it’s tradable.

['Staking Locked TRU Proposal'],"Summary
This is a proposal to allow private sale investors to: 1) stake some of their locked TRU as part of the vesting schedule and 2) use some of their locked TRU to vote on governance proposals.
Background / Motivation
As we all know, a 2 years vesting schedule was put in place for both the team and private sale buyers. It was only close to 3 years after the private sale that this was set up. Although this initiative received support, it was never clarified that locked TRU wouldn’t be able to be used for staking and/or voting on governance proposals. As a consequence private sale buyers have been heavily penalized in the participation of the rewards structure and governance in comparison to anyone who bought in at launch or hereabout, but have also been unable to participate and support the TrueFi ecosystem to a larger extent.
This is a topic that has been at the center of many debates since October/November, and we wish to find a fair solution so that early investors are not as penalized in comparison to later purchasers.
We understand that this topic has raised various concerns and that it has been seen as a risk for penalizing the long term growth of the protocol. We therefore would like to propose a solution that we believe is fair and tries to meet expectations of both opposite views.
Specification
We propose that locked token holders be able to 1) stake some of their locked/unlocked TRU in order to participate in the rewards system fairly and 2) use their stkTRU generated from locked tokens to vote on governance proposals.
Three concerns have been addressed by the community over the last months around this particular subject: 1) allowing locked tokens to generate rewards will create additional selling pressure 2) non private sale investors will be diluted in the rewards scheme 3) in the event of a default, locked tokens could be brought into circulation as a result of the 10% slashing rule.
We aimed, in this proposal, to address all concerns as follows:
1. Additional vesting: in order to avoid creating short term selling pressure, we suggest that all rewards generated as a result of staking locked tokens be similarly locked until a 9th unlocking event in November 2022.
2. Maximum locked staking: in order to minimize the dilution of the rewards from TRU staking, we would suggest that only 75% of the locked tokens be allowed to be used for staking.
3. Unlocked/locked minimum ratio: Additionally, in order to be able to stake locked tokens, we would suggest adding an obligation to maintain a ratio of unlocked/locked staked tokens of 30%/70%. As an example, if you would want to stake 100k TRU, you would need to ensure that you have at least 30k unlocked TRU. This addresses two points: 1) in the event of a default, or multiple defaults, no locked tokens would be brought into circulation as the 30%/70% unlocked/locked ratio ensures that sufficient unlocked TRU can be used for slashing in case of multiple defaults. We would suggest, that in the case of a first default, and that the ratio is brought under 30%/70%, the cooldown period automatically be started until the ratio is brought back up to the minimum required (this may require more technical thinking). 2) as a result of this minimum requirement, additional buying pressure could be seen from private sale investors as to keep staking more locked tokens, one would need to purchase unlocked tokens on the market (so the ratio is maintained) and hence benefit current TRU holders collectively.
NB: This ratio should be adjusted as we go through more unlocking events. Ideally, this should be done dynamically (going from 30/70 to 100/0 linearly until November 2022) but we believe this could be implemented as a static one to start with and be adjusted accordingly as we go through the vesting process.
4. Giving back to the protocol/community: as a way to try and meet expectations from both ends and benefit the long term growth of the protocol, we would like to propose that 25% of the rewards generated from the locked tokens be either: 1) burnt, 2) added to the SAFU, 3) given back to the pool of rewards (may have technical limitations), 4) used for marketing purposes (such as for an influencer fund), 5) a mix of those.
We believe this is a fair proposal that addresses all previously mentioned concerns and would greatly benefit the TrueFi ecosystem if implemented as well as involve further private sale investors in the participation of building a long term successful protocol/ecosystem.",54,240.8,2021-03-11
['Staking Locked TRU Proposal'],"I support this proposal.  I’ve talked with Carl and others about this going back to last year and Rafael said he liked it in the Discord group.   I think it’s pretty simple:


I want to re-engage the original “whale” investors from 2017 and 2018 like a16z &  Blocktower, & others so how do we do that, let’s incentivize them to 1) pay attention again 2) farm, and to 3) become more active in governance.


This could create a huge amount of aftermarket buying from these original VC and whale investors who will have to buy large amounts of TRU on the open market in order to stake their TRU.


This should cause our TVL to go through the roof, and maybe we climb up on Defi Pulse, thus getting us more exposure and more demand for the coin.  In fact it could send our TVL up by a factor of 2x to 3x unless I’m mistaken.


Overall seems like this could re-invigorate the original strong TRU community that backed the TUSD stablecoin, while limiting the effects of dilution.  This could be the steroid shot that TRU needs right now.",49,29.8,2021-03-11
['Staking Locked TRU Proposal'],"I support this proposal 100%. This is a very solid write up and should address others in the community who may have concerns.

This should immediately increase our TVL which gives tons of exposure especially on Defi Pulse.
I know a few pre sale investor who dont plan on selling TRU anytime soon but have no idea how quickly the protocol has grown and the potential opportunities available. This will help re engage them.
Good for marketing that the Truefi team has thought about original investors and at the same time, shows that the original investors continue to support the project.
Part 3 will entice existing investors to HODL!

['Staking Locked TRU Proposal'],"This proposal takes a balanced approach and looks fair to me. Especially the 70/30 rule for staking. Firstly, thanks Carl for this proposal. Agree with Jupiter capital that this will increase TVL and gives a boost in DeFi pulse. And finally love point 4. Anything that helps in burning tokens or increasing the contribution to SAFU will be super useful for the overall health of the TrueFi ecosystem.",46,69.2,2021-03-11
['Staking Locked TRU Proposal'],"Thanks @carlj for the proposal. I like this proposal and want to extend my support for this completely. I think its a well-balanced proposal which outlines clear benefits of staking locked TRU to the existing TrueFi community. Some of the points which I feel are quite good and should be mentioned are:

TRU emission from the staked tokens is locked for additional 3 months post Nov 2022  unlock and hence it doesn’t dilute the current TRU supply at all, removing any additional sell pressure from stake TRU earnings
Most presale investors believe in the long-term vision of TrueFi but have no way to support the platform directly with their locked tokens. The unlocked/locked ratio allows the long-term presale investors to stake their locked tokens and use them for voting but imposes on a fixed ratio of unlocked tokens they have to hold and stake all the time.  The strategy proposed by carl for a fixed/dynamic unlocked/locked ratio is one of a kind but also quite brilliant as it benefits both Presale holders and TrueFi community for a couple of reasons:
a) it removes unfair benefit from staking only locked tokens as it imposes a ratio of unlocked tokens needed alongside all the time
b) it ensures that even in the case of 3 consecutive defaults(30% remittance) the TRU emission into circulation will be from the unlocked staking stash of every investor
c) 25% of emission from staked pool contributes directly to the SAFU fund/burnt so it either quickly fills up the SAFU fund or reduces the circulation supply continuously introducing a constant burn mechanism which directly benefits existing TRU holders
d) Imposes a buy pressure from the early investors who want to stake more, thus creating a steady buy pressure as more tokens are unlocked.

I think this will increase the involvement of presale investors more and more and also incentivize them to hold long while allowing them to secure the network by contributing to SAFU fund or token burn. Most existing projects like Avalanche, Flow, Solana, Casper all allow presale investors to stake tokens as well, and hence I think this proposal is a great way to allow TRU holders to stake their locked tokens while securing the TrueFi network directly.
I think noticed @rafaelcosman also mentioned support for this proposal in the discord recently so it looks like this proposal has been drafted taking into consideration recommendations from the team which gives me more confidence in this.",50,40.0,2021-03-12
['Staking Locked TRU Proposal'],100% support this proposal.  It makes sense and I believe this provides a nice tradeoff between HODL and giving long-term TRU holders an incentive to keep holding.,49,54.8,2021-03-12
['Staking Locked TRU Proposal'],"I’m against this plan, much as I would like to farm my locked tokens.
First of all, it feels mostly zero-sum - other than the part about using 25% for SAFU/burn, it’s just increasing the share of rewards going to locked-token holders by reducing the share going to unlocked-token holders. And I think this is unfair to the unlocked token holders - when they bought those tokens they thought they knew the distribution schedule, and now we’re proposing to flood the farming with tokens that they thought wouldn’t exist yet. Yes I know this same “they thought they knew what they were buying” argument is precisely why this proposal exists in the first place: presale purchasers thought they were buying unlocked tokens. I’m just noting that in trying to rectify that, we’re proposing to do the same thing to others.
Second, I’m not sure it’s actually a good thing to incentivize presale folks to hodl any more than we already are. Since most TRU tokens start out in the hands of someone with locked tokens (presale or company), every token that they sell to someone outside that set is furthering the cause of decentralization. Not that I’m planning to sell mine any time soon    but I feel like it might actually be good for the protocol if I did.
Third, this looks to me like it would require LOTS of engineering work. Which means even if my first two points aren’t quite enough to convince me this proposal is a net negative for the protocol, they’re definitely enough to convince me that this isn’t enough of a net positive to justify putting this anywhere close to the front of the engineering queue - I think they have many months worth of stuff planned that I’d rather see first, including at least all the v3 goals like multi-asset support, on-chain credit modeling, and lines of credit.",49,84.8,2021-03-12

Also, I appreciate that you took some of my feedback into consideration. However, I still share some of the same concerns as Benjamin. I’m not sure that the proposed burns/safu are enough to fix the underlying drag that the ICO tokenomics model has had for the growth of the protocol. Most of all, I am worried about the negative optics of choosing to allocate scarce engineering resources to something that will exclusively benefit insiders and impede decentralization. In my ideal world, there’d have been no presale at all. On the other hand… of course I’d love to earn some yield on locked tokens. So, I guess I’ll just abstain from voting.",40,58.0,2021-03-12

I’m commenting here as someone who is NOT an early investor and therefore NO locked TRU in play. I purchased my TRU post go live. The success of this platform will be the self governance and risk assessment of the community. The more people and more TRU in active play only helps accelerate this. Although short term I’d lose out with this change - as my % of the daily staked TRU rewards would drop - accelerating the growth and sharing the loan default risk will only increase the TRU value. Allowing their TRU to be used on the platform but not sold in exchanges avoids the risk of whale dumping. Also having their TRU rewards locked stops these being sold too. Finally, having their TRU in play - if there is a default, their TRU will also be slashed - sharing the risk more widely.",39,37.8,2021-03-12

I’d be more interested in seeing work that is focused on increasing the value of TRU for the long term and for all holders.

With that in mind, it seems more important to focus on work like expanding support for other stable coins to increase the size of the loan pool, adding L2 integration to make it economical for retail to loan/stake etc.",33,36.6,2021-03-13
['Staking Locked TRU Proposal'],I do not support this at all. I agree with @dnlklr and what he says.,33,21.6,2021-03-13
['Staking Locked TRU Proposal'],"A lot of opinions have been voiced already but I got asked to voice mine as well. I’m sharing my views being a retail investor.
Let me start by saying that I understand the perspective of the presale investors. You invested early, showed confidence in the project and in an ideal scenario want to be rewarded for that in every possible way.
But ask yourself this question, why did you invest? Part of that decision-making process surely must have been that you believe in the fundamentals of this project. The decentralised nature of governing it with all types of investors. You want it to succeed, grow, be looked upon as a solid project in the cryptospace, build up a community where FUD is not an issue caused by well thought out decisions. To achieve this you must avoid anything that can jeopardize the credibility and transparent nature of the project. If retail people invest in the offspring of a company called >TRUST<token then the last thing they will accept is last-minute tinkering with distribution favourable to presale investors.
If presale investors were promised staking for their locked TRU then that promise should be kept. Period. Breaking that promise would also tarnish TRUSTtokens credibility.
If that’s not the case I believe presale investors should be happy with their current (nearly) 5x return and the possibility to stake their already unlocked TRU. The amount of TRU that they can stake will increase periodically just like a retail investor might increase their position in TrueFi over time.
Furthermore the most fundamental problem with this project is the total supply and the rate in which it will be unlocked. That is already being looked into and might be improved. Allowing staking for locked TRU will put an extra spotlight on these legacy tokenomics (reminiscent of moneygrabbing in the 2017 ICO craze) and will add an additional distribution issue (centralisation of TRU) into the mix.
The 30/70 proposal might lead to some short term buying pressure (if retail doesn’t counter it with selling pressure as a result of this proposal being accepted) but the long-term damage will be irreparable.
I’ll finish with what I’ve written in discord to show how things could play out for the average retail investor buying TrueFi. But in the end going ahead with this proposal would negatively impact the reputation of the entire project and all parties involved.
What I wrote on Discord:
'Just imagine buying today at 4,5 times presale price. You fork out the hefty gasfees and binance fee for withdrawing to stake. You are planning to hold long term anyway. Now, as a new TrueFi enthousiast you are not aware of the proposal at the forum. You forget about your staked TRU for a month and open up the True Fi ‘app’ to check how your 60+ %  ROI has been doing. BOOM, yearly ROI has dropped to 15%. You check YouTube to see if anybody made a video recently about TrueFi. You find a paid influencer with a huge following talking about the positive parts of TrueFi. Then you scroll down to the comment section. flushed  You see 1500 comments of pissed retail investors not only commenting about the enourmous total supply but even more so they are fuming about the recently changed distribution of that hefty supply towards presale investors. TrueFi has just paid a large sum of money to an influencer for horrible publicity.
Long story short. Pissed of retail investors are way more vocal and potentially detrimental then I think the team is aware off at this point. I won’t be one of them, I will move on calmly but right now I feel I should speak out while nothing is lost yet.
Please reconsider before this will blow up in everybody’s face.’",34,66.8,2021-03-13
['Staking Locked TRU Proposal'],"I support this proposal in philosophy though I am concerned about the dev resources and additional complexity (auditing, maintenance, security, etc.) that such a system would introduce.
I am also a private sale investor and would personally benefit from such a system existing.
Despite that, my view is that all TRU holders benefit if TrueFi meets its 2021 roadmap goals.  When I assess what is better for the entire ecosystem (investors, liquidity providers, loan recipients, stakers, TrustToken team) - implementing this feature vs adding USDC support / building a SAFU / integrating with layer 2 to reduce fees.   It seems pretty clear to me that the latter has a much higher chance of being a huge impact.
I would support & contribute if the community reaches a governance quorum, writes the smart contracts, hires an auditor, and submits a pull request to the TrueFi team.   I do not support this feature if it pulls the TrueFi dev team away from the 2021 roadmap.",32,66.4,2021-03-14

['Loan Voting Questions from a crypto Noob'],"Hi, I am new to TruFi and crypto in general, but love this company.  I have purchased and staked a little over 16,000 Tru and an interesting in investing more in the future and as I learn about the company and how to use the platform.  I am currently the CDO of an equipment finance company and have worked in such capacity with multiple financial products through my career.  With that, I am very interested in using my knowledge in underwriting to vote on Tru loan applications, but am having trouble finding information on/figuring out how the actual voting process works and what I’m doing with my staked TRU.  I apologize in advance if these questions are “basic” or “obvious,” but all I know about Tru and crypto in general, I’ve had to figure out myself with no help.  Thanks for your time and I’d really appreciate the help.
1-As staked I have staked my TRU and see where I can vote YES or NO on a loan application.  When I vote YES or NO on a particular loan, does that lock the staked TRU I use to vote for the duration of the loan or loan process?  Example: If I vote YES with all of my staked TRU for a 90 day loan that is approved, does that mean I cannot unstake my TRU for 90 days or until that loan is complete?
2- It seems as though there is a reward to claim from a loan you vote on.  Is this true, is there a reward you can claim for voting on loans that is separate from the reward you receive from being staked?  If so, what is that reward and how is it determined? I’ve noticed the cost in gas for voting YES or NO on a loan is about $20, and I imagine claiming your reward is about the same.  I might vote even if this is a losing proposition as I’d like to support the platform, but I’d like to understand what happens before I do it, and simply can’t find an in depth breakdown anywhere.
3-When you vote YES or NO on a loan application does the staked TRU you use to vote still earn the interest it’s currently earning for being staked? Sorry if this seems obvious, but I’m actually not sure if you are still earning the near 55% when you vote with your staked TRU
4-If you vote YES on a loan with your staked TRU and that loan defaults is your risk of loss any greater than it is when you have not used your staked TRU to vote? My understanding is that if you have staked TRU and a loan defaults you can lose up to 10% of your staked TRU.  Is that correct?  And if you vote on a loan that defaults, can you lose all of the staked TRU you voted with?
5-When you vote on a loan with staked TRU, does that staked TRU now leave my wallet?
6- As far as finding information on these loans go, so you can research the company, I see that a lot of information is posted on this medium.  Is there a place I can see how TRUs underwriting model scored it?  I see the contract details, but am not sure how to view that information.  Basically I’m asking the best place to find information on the loan request, so I can do due diligence

['PLEASE HELP a noob Token Staking Rewards - Help a new guy please'],"Hello,
Full disclosure.  I am fairly new to crypto and Davy enough to have figured out how to purchase TrueFi and get it staked (which for a noob that doesn’t know people that invest in crypto is no small feet.  If crypto was more accessible to us normal folk, man this would get bigger). Anyway I am the CDO for an equipment leasing/finance company and am so impressed with what TrueFi is doing.
Anyway, I really need a help with a few things and would beyond appreciate someone making the attempt.  If I could I’d bake you cookies.  If possible, please try to respond as basically as possible as I am teaching myself everything, which means it each let of this process like adding a token to a wallet, I’ve been winging it.
1-Is there a way to suggest a change on this board to TrueFi.  I staked quite a bit of True and love it, however the gas fees are annoying.  Because of that it doesn’t make sense to claim your rewards and then restate them all that often.  I’d like to suggest and option where TrueFi re-stakes people’s rewards if they opt in.  I imagine there would be a fee for that on the end of True for re-staking, but if enough people opt in they could just do it in buckets.  It would make the returns so much more attractive for people and the only place I am staking crypto that does that is Kraken, but because of that I know it’s possible.  If there is a way to suggest that, please tell me how. I also think if this was active, it would really incentivize minor investors (guys/gals/whoever with like $1000 of true to stake because if it could compound, they’d actually make up their fees if they wanted to hold long term) - I’d also like to recommend marketing this APR some or asking people with channels to do so.  I’ve personally had 4 friends that don’t do this buy True and stake it when I explained the risk/reward of doing so.  I believe that if more people simply knew what was being offered to TrueFi token holders through the stake alone, this would be massive and I only found out about it by doing a lot of digging after I had already invested in TrueFi because I simply loved the company and what they were trying to accomplish. I’m even considering having my company look into being whitelisted to borrow
2-With the trTUSD reward is that different that TUSD if so, where can you swap or trade those, so you can at some point sell them.
3-In my meta wallet I created a token for stTruFi.  Does it in anyway hurt me that those tokens are in my wallet?
4- I can’t vote on loan applications and would very much like to.  While I am a crypto newbie, I have expansive underwriting knowledge and experience.  When I watched the brief TrueFi video on staking there was a box underneath where the staking information was that said “delegate your Tru” and they said to do that to vote.  In my chrome browser I have no option to delegate.  My page simply doesn’t have that blue box.  Is there anything I can do to participate in voting
Thanks so much for reading this and for any help.",23,304.6,2021-03-18
['PLEASE HELP a noob Token Staking Rewards - Help a new guy please'],"
You’re definitely not the only one appalled by Ethereum gas fees. Unfortunately my understanding of automatic re-staking suggests it’s basically impossible on-chain in Ethereum. Can you send a link to something showing that Kraken does this for an on-chain Ethereum asset? I see that they have some off-chain staking going on, in which case they can do whatever they want, and I also see they’re working with some other blockchains which might do things differently and/or the transaction fees might be much smaller.
tfTUSD (I assume that’s what you mean by trTUSD) represents your share in the lending pool; it should go up in value as loans produce interest (and down in value if a loan defaults), and it can be redeemed for TUSD via the Withdraw button here: TrueFi | Uncollateralized Borrowing & High Yield Lending

stkTRU (I assume that’s what you mean by stTruFi) represents your share of all TRU that has been staked. I’m not sure what you mean by hurting you in your wallet - where else would they be if not in your wallet?
so to clarify, you staked your TRU after the v2 launch yet did not see the delegate option? or is it that you want to vote without staking?

['PLEASE HELP a noob Token Staking Rewards - Help a new guy please'],"Wow- thanks so much for getting back to me so fast.  I apologize as I am probabbly not tech savvy enough to do what I do with crytpo.  I’m actually proud of myself for figuring enough out to do things like purchase TrueFi and stake it. I beyond appreciate your reply and help.
1-I had no idea the staking was different.  Kraken does this when you stake through them (I don’t know if it’s off-chain or not) but I’m guessing you know better lol.  Thanks.
2-I did mean trTUSD. I see the reward and I see how to claim it.  What I was confused about was if I needed to add the trTUSD token to my wallet or if when I claim that I can simply put it in a wallet for TUSD.  If it is a separate token when I claim it, the link you gave me is where I go to swap it for TUSD? Thanks.  Again, when you are not in crypto, have no knowledge base and no one to show you, it’s far from idiot proof, so it beyond helps to have someone point out what seems easy to them to a complete noob.  Thanks so much. Your prompt reply made me more happy I bought so much of this 
3-I did mean StTruFi  When I staked my TruFi I did not realize it went to my wallet.  Once I deciphered that it was technically a different token,  I spent hours hunting it down and teaching myself how to add a token to a wallet.  To my surprise when I added the StTruFi token to my MetaMask wallet the tokens where there.  As someone that really has a limited understanding of this, I just wanted to make sure I didn’t pull out my stake in some weird way.  Your response makes me feel they should be in my wallet and that I didn’t mess anything up.  I probabbly should have had the token there before staking?
4-I did stake my TRU and it was after the V2 launch. I do want to vote AND I did not and do not see the delegate button or that blue box that it was in.  I am staked for a good bit and would love to vote as a stakeholder, but it says voting is unavailable to me and I don’t see that box.  It does show I’m on V2 and I have an option to go to the V1 page from the staking page. I believe my stake is working as I am getting rewards tallied and all of that

['PLEASE HELP a noob Token Staking Rewards - Help a new guy please'],"2/3: I’m a bit concerned by your “I did mean trTUSD” and “I did mean StTruFi” - there are no tokens I can find by those names. I would strongly suggest you only use the exact ticker symbols (i.e. “tfTUSD” and “stkTRU”) rather than alternate abbreviations, since there are many similar-sounding tokens and you don’t want to get either wrong advice or e.g. buy the wrong token.
2/3: Through MetaMask, you have a general-purpose Ethereum account which can hold any kind of token. The key thing to understand about how these tokens actually work: when I “transfer” say some tfTUSD to you, nothing actually interacts with you or your address directly at all. Instead, I tell the tfTUSD smart contract that some of the tokens currently being recorded as my balance should instead be recorded as your balance. This means that from your perspective, unless you are watching the tfTUSD contract, you won’t know anything has happened at all. The transfer still goes through just fine, but your MetaMask won’t know about it and thus won’t show it to you unless you “add the token” to the list that MetaMask is watching. You don’t lose anything by adding the token late though - the transfer is binding regardless of whether you are watching it happen or not.

['[Idea] Use v1 protocol fees to establish community treasury'],"Background:
The TrueFi lending pool currently holds 143,750 TUSD in claimable fees earned by the protocol. These fees come from the 0.25% origination fee collected on each of the loans issued through v1 of the protocol (57.5mm TUSD x 0.25% = 143,750 TUSD).
In v2 of the protocol, these fees go to TRU stakers as described here. For these fees earned in v1, it’s up to governance to decide what to do with the fees.
Idea:
The lending pool could deposit 143,750 TUSD in claimable fees into a wallet designated as the TrueFi community treasury fund. This deposit would create the community treasury, in which TrustToken has announced it will contribute 10% of company tokens from Unlock #1.
Governance could then choose how to deploy these funds. Community discussions have proposed putting these funds into the TrueFi lending pool to earn interest and/or to move these funds into the SAFU at a later date after the SAFU has been established.

Some ideas/comments/observations to get the discussion started:

I believe we want the insurance pool to be comprised of assets besides just $TRU
I believe we want the backstop fund to be self-sustaining
It would be interesting if the backstop fund could grow by yield farming/earning yield, either in TrueFi or other protocols
I’m interested in DerivaDEX’s insurance mining program (Blog Post 1, Blog Post 2, Docs) to bootstrap the protocol’s insurance fund. As of writing, they have $40.6mm USD staked. As I understand, people stake USD-assets, earn DDX token for 1 year and if in the span of 1-year there is a big liquidation, the USD-assets would be drawn down. But after 1-year, presumably these people will unstake and then the DerivaDEX insurance fund capitalization needs to come from other places (in their case: liquidations and fees)? DerivaDEX’s governance could extend the staking rewards past 1-year and then the insurance mining could continue.

Given how many unallocated incentives we have for TRU (on the low end, 13mm… on the high end: 65mm) this is a possibility for us too
Staked USD assets could leverage Yearn Vaults + (Coverage from NXM/Cover) for yield, insurance fund retains accrued yield which then acts as “PCV” or Protocol Controlled Value.


Could you stake TRU/ETH LP tokens in the backstop fund so that users are both providing liquidity and offering a backstop (which is farming TRU)

['[Ideas] Designing the TrueFi Backstop Fund'],"I would suggest making the backstop level dynamic based on the risk profile of the overall portfolio (maybe utilizing a few key parameters). As the company advances over time and credit analysis becomes more robust, the need for an over-funded backstop may begin to feel like a draconian use of resources (self-sustaining or otherwise). Just a thought.",29,55.8,2021-03-02
['[Ideas] Designing the TrueFi Backstop Fund'],"I like MakerDAO’s System Surplus Buffer as an inspiration for TrueFi’s backstop fund design.
One simple self-sustaining structure could be:

[ y ]% of protocol fees earned (earned in tfTUSD or TUSD) are sent to the backstop fund
once backstop fund value reaches >=  $[ x ], then all fees earned go to TRU stakers
governance can vote to send backstop funds to the lending pool or other recipient(s) in an adverse event
as the protocol grows, governance can decide to adjust the amount held in the backstop fund and/or the % of protocol fees diverted into the fund

I see the backstop fund as a failsafe to protect lenders, above and beyond the protection TRU staking provides. For this reason, I think the backstop fund should be very conservative. I could be swayed though – I’m just not as familiar with the insurance mining model.
Alpha Homora also has a similar reserve model:

10% of borrower’s interest will be stored in Alpha Homora Bank Reserves, which can be used as an insurance fund for lenders in case of unexpected scenarios.

['[Ideas] Designing the TrueFi Backstop Fund'],"The loans are given in TUSD right?
It would be nice to see some amount of the SAFU fund held in TUSD (as a stablecoin the value is assured) and some amount held in TRU (more locked tokens helps increase value).  The TUSD can be yield farmed in a stablecoin pair that doesn’t have high risk of impermanent loss and has high liquidity so that it is readily available in the case of a default.
I see that staking TFI-LP could be interesting, a concept that parallels traditional finance would be tranches of liquidity providers.  Instead of a new way to stake TFI-LP, just take the APY that is earned by the loan interest and allow liquidity providers to choose a higher risk tranche with higher APY (first to be slashed in the case of a default) and lower risk tranche with lower APY.  I think this may achieve similar design goals and it is easier to approach for those coming from traditional finance",27,25.4,2021-03-07

It’s a mutual aid health insurance product that requires no upfront payments or premiums. However, whenever a claim is submitted by someone, all the other users of Xianghubao will pay their approved claims. Per S1:

“If the claim is approved, the participant will receive a one-time payout, the cost of which is shared equally by all other participants. In 2019, the average annual contribution made by each Xianghubao participant to cover claims was RMB29 ($4).”

What happens behind the scenes if the TUSD is put into yield farming via Curve or AAVE or a more complicated financial instrument should all be fine assuming that financial vehicle can be quickly liquidated with low slippage in the event of a loan default.

Another semi-related proposal we’ve been discussing is to create traunches within the LP farms - with this system tokens deposited into the farm will be burned in case of a default, thus moving the supply of LP tokens closer to the value of assets in the pool. Users depositing LP tokens earn TRU in exchange for taking on the risk of default, those who wish to minimize default risk simply keep their LP tokens and earn the 13-16%.
This way we have 3 ways to mitigate defaults: TRU staked, SAFU funds, and LP tokens staked. TRU is always being emitted to those taking on default risk (rather than emitting TRU to those with lower risk).",15,33.0,2021-03-12

['Quantfury Trading Borrowing Request'],"Quantfury (the “Company”) (www.quantfury.com – outside of North America) offers traders, investors, and cryptocurrency holders, to trade traditional financial and cryptocurrency markets at existing global exchange spot prices with zero fees. The Company was founded in 2017 by Lev Mazur (the “Founder”), and since launching it’s native Android and iPhone app, in December 2018, has amassed hundreds of thousands of retail clients worldwide, in over 100 countries. Today, Quantfury has processed trailing 30-day volume over $11 billion dollars and this figure is growing rapidly as trailing 24-hour volume is $0.5 billion dollars (~15b monthly run rate / 182.5b annual run rate). The Company’s app store ratings, user satisfaction, and user retention are among the highest in the industry when compared to retail brokerages and cryptocurrency exchanges.
We are thrilled to participate in TrueFi, and are interested in borrowing 1,000,000 TUSD for 90 days at a rate of 11.5% p/a. If this loan is successful, we would plan accordingly to finance our future proprietary strategies using working capital loans, which will free up cashflow for reinvestment in the business. Given historical and anticipated returns being generated from proprietary strategies, borrowing against these strategies at a reasonable interest rate should result in safe risk-adjusted returns for TrueFi’s investors.
Business Model
The Company’s business model offers retail traders unmatched trading conditions, offering both entirely free trading (free of any trading fees, commissions, maker/taker fees, leverage fees, or setup fees) and offering real-time back to asset prices directly from global exchanges (including Binance spot exchange for cryptocurrencies). The Company is counterparty to its retail traders and as such needs to enter into significant proprietary trading strategies in order to both generate revenues and manage risk of its B-Book. These trading strategies are executed on both institutional cryptocurrency trading desks as well as other reputable global exchanges.
The Company employs significant resources focused on proprietary trading, data science, and artificial intelligence, and the Founder has over 25 years of trading experience and is widely recognized as a thought-leader in the cryptocurrency space.
Stakeholders
The Company is tightly held, with approximately 40% controlled indirectly by the Founder. Invictus Hyperion (www.invictuscapital.com) is also a 15% owner in Quantfury, having invested in the Company’s seed round. Mr. Ilya Yavorsky is a shareholder and the Company’s sole director, although the Company has a large advisory group surrounding it, including but not limited to, Daniel Schwartzkopff (from Invictus Capital) and Ali Pourdad (from Pourdad Capital – www.pourdad.com). Mr. Pourdad previously founded Progressa (www.progressa.com), a Canadian consumer financial technology lender, which was recognized globally by CB Insights in 2017, and was the 11th fastest growing company in Canada, by revenue, in 2018 in Profit500 magazine. Mr. Pourdad is day-to-day with the Company leadership team. In addition, Luke Brindle is the Company’s Head of Automated Trading Strategies, who is an industry veteran with over 15 years in quantitative trading and the hedge fund industry.
Financials
The Company remains privately held and as such does not disclose financial information. With this being said, we can share that the Company generates substantial cash-flow and historical profits and to date, it has paid shareholders over $18 million of dividends before Dec 31, 2020.
Purpose of Loan
The Company anticipates using de-fi loans in order to finance short term proprietary trading strategies. Initially it plans to allocate $1 million to its Automated Series A Trading Strategies , with details of this trading strategy outlined in Appendix A to this loan application, including historical returns.
We appreciate the community and TrueFi for reviewing this proposal. Please feel free to ask any questions, and we’ll do our best to answer them quickly and concisely.
Expected structure of loan proceeds
The Company’s plan is to take this loan in a method that protects the TrueFi investor community. As such, we have described the structure of our entities ( See Exhibit 1 ) below and how we intend to take the loan and segregate the proceeds from Quantfury’s normal brokerage business operations:
Exhibit 1 – Organizational Structure
A733×275 19.7 KB
Loan would be to Quantfury Trading (BVI) – an asset management business, with no prior operations and no assets or liabilities. Funds would be used for proprietary trading and flow back out to loan repayment, leaving trading profits to aggregate in the asset management company. Any shortfall, if applicable, due to trading losses would be covered by Quantfury TGE Limited (the parent holding company). All companies are under common control and management.
Appendix A – Automated Trading Strategy Series A
The following table shows total dollar returns by strategy for Series A. The Company employs four main strategies concurrently, as can be seen, historical dollar returns ranging from 139.52% to 481.03% per 13-month period, with maximum drawdown (on capital) ranging from 7.58% to 27.33%.

['[Idea] Design for Governance-Directed Token Grant Pool'],"Based on fairly impassioned conversations in TrueFi Discord and on the forum alike, it seems that there’s a pretty strong desire among at least a portion of the TrueFi community for a TRU budget directly aimed at marketing/educational activities. These might include AMAs, influencer collaborations, video explainer production and other non-obvious ecosystem grants like, say, securing a conference sponsorship or funding a hackathon.
This Idea thread will seek FIRST to gather input on, and AFTER substantial discussion, eventually propose a design for governance-directed ecosystem grants, denominated in TRU from the Community Treasury, targeted at marketing outcomes.
Our guiding questions in this discussion:

How do we align incentives between TRU holders, TrueFi users, and grant recipients?
What other projects have a high quality community grants process from which we should learn?

What this discussion is not:
To date, TrustToken Inc has been reasonably aggressive with spending company TRU in the pursuit of growing awareness, and is continuously ramping up these efforts. This thread is not to discuss TRU-funded marketing efforts to date (ie how much was spent, or on what).
It’s also not to receive feedback on how TrustToken Inc spends its discretionary TRU on marketing efforts - plenty of room for that conversation elsewhere.
This thread is also not an attempt to respond to the token economics discussion - if we all arrive on a design for this pool we like, it should be compatible with any allotment of TRU.
What this discussion is:
Instead, this thread is to discuss how the community might spend the TRU allocated to a governance-directed TrueFi Protocol “Community Treasury” that has yet to be finalized.
Designing a Marketing/Ecosystem Grants Methodology:
I think any grant methodology should fulfill a number of simple but important mechanics:
(1) Transparent - the grant design should emphasize consistently clear understanding at the level of the system (“Here’s how to apply - 4 easy steps”), the grant seeker (“Here’s what I propose, here’s why I think it’ll work, here’s how I’ll report results”), and the community (“Here’s what we do and don’t like, here’s what we think it’s worth, here are the KPIs to which we’d like to keep you accountable.”)
(2) Accountable - the grant design should build in some type of performance indicators to which the community and the grant-seeker mutually agree, and, in my opinion, by which the grant should be tranched (on milestone A, unlock tranche 1 of 4; milestone B, unlock tranche 2 of 4…)
(3) Appropriately Lucrative - Those making a big impact on TrueFi should be richly rewarded. I believe they should also be exposed to the price action of the asset in which the grant is made. As such, I believe grants should be made in TRU, not in $X USD of TRU.
(4) Long-term Aligned - In my opinion, paying an influencer for a single video is not a good use of a grant. Giving that same influencer, bug bounty hunter, or crypto educator a locked TRU allocation tied to the success of the platform is a good use of a grant. I’d propose these unlocks try to optimize for substantial milestones for the platform as a whole, such as $X of TVL, Y # of wallets holding TRU, and that each grant is made with a substantial time frame in mind, such as 3-12 months.
(5) Simple but Robust - A good grant design system should have creative constraints (ie available grant sizes, available types of requests, standard KPI requirements) that make it easy for nearly all community members to substantively opine on the proposals. At the same time, a good grant design system should not be so rigid as to exclude creative, new proposals.
I’d love to start the conversation by learning which projects (ideally crypto DAOs, but not necessarily) have a sound grants process. I’ll post one of my favorite suggestions to start us off.",29,110.8,2021-02-13
['[Idea] Design for Governance-Directed Token Grant Pool'],"One of my favorite recent Ecosystem Grants designs: UMA’s KPI Options & Airdrop, shared with me by @Jacks.
From the post:

Tl;dr — UMA will be airdropping a new incentivization mechanism called a “KPI option” to a curated list of addresses in DeFi. The value of these options depends on the TVL of the UMA protocol, thereby giving every recipient an incentive to grow the protocol. (KPI = key performance indicator)
Compared to a typical airdrop which can be easily dumped, KPI options are synthetic tokens that will pay out more rewards as the core KPI of the protocol grows.
The Risk Labs foundation has allotted 2,000,000 $UMA [~$60M USD] for this purpose. The target date for the close of this program is June 2021, at which point the KPI options will be redeemable for $UMA. These tokens will have a minimum value of 1 $UMA each — but if the KPI target is hit, they will pay out 20 $UMA, a 20x increase.
",30,91.0,2021-02-13
['[Idea] Design for Governance-Directed Token Grant Pool'],"We dug into this idea with the UMA team. Here’s what we learned:
Imagine a token design that would allow TrueFi to issue TRU tokens pegged to the TVL of the TrueFi pool. Let’s call these tokens TRU-TVL for the time being, and refer to this concept as “conditional rewards tokens”. Read UMA’s explaination here here: KPI Options 1-pager - Google Docs
How these may work:

Assume when TVL size = X/2, TRU-TVL is worth 0; at TVL = X, TRU-TVL is worth 1 TRU; at TVL = 2X, TRU-TVL is worth 2… up to 3
At date Y, these “options” are called and the TRU relative to the TVL is distributed, on a 2-week trailing average of TVL
These tokens are tied to the TUSD (vs the TRU) in the pool; in the future, could be tied each to DAI/USDC/etc in the pool to motivate specific pool growth.

We’d like to explore using these conditional reward tokens to offer folks a way of aligning incentives with platform growth, specifically promoting word of mouth.
What we’d need to do to proceed:


Allocation: To mint TRU-TVL, TRU must be locked (escrowed?) proportional to the highest reward tier. If the option’s ceiling is 3 TRU per each TRU-TVL at the highest target TVL, then one must lock 300k TRU to mint 100k TRU-TVL. The question: what allocation should go to this mechanic?

Goal TVL: What target TVL should we promote, such at that once it’s reached (again, at a 2 week trailing average), the TRU-TVL value moves to the next tier? Current pool size is $50.4m in TUSD.

Timeline: Over what timeline should we run this initiative? As purely an analogy, when should this “option” be “called”? Consider this may likely cause circulating TRU to increase (provided TVL has grown) at moment of call, so we’d probably not want to align with any other major unlock period.

Distribution: How should TRU-TVL be distributed? Grants? Farms? Trade-in? Pure buy?

Distribution Ideas:
Consider option 1: Alternative to TFI-LP farm. Instead of farming pure TRU with staked TFI-LP, you may have the option of farming TRU-TVL, which is worth less at t=0, but may be three times as much at t=end.
Consider option 2: TrueFi treasury grants TRU-TVL to influencers of its choice. Influencer can sell at t=0, sure, but for very little; influencer can also help pump TVL and sell TRU-TVL at a vastly appreciated value.
Consider option 3: The sale of TRU-TVL directly to the market, either directly via TrueFi or a DEX. This may also mean TRU-TVL would have ongoing liquidity, if it were a standard pair on a DEX. Optionally, the sale could be offered in exchange of TRU that’s then burned.
These ideas are not mutually exclusive.",27,110.4,2021-02-24
['[Idea] Design for Governance-Directed Token Grant Pool'],"I am not here to be pessimistic. However, pegging some token values with TVL is not always a good idea.
Everything goes well when TVL goes up pushing TRU-TVL value grows faster than TRU. People earning money will participate actively in the community and YOLO. However, if the TVL drops or only slowly growing, the delta of TRU-TVL compared to TRU will drop to lower than 0.5 and time value drops. People will lose incentives to participate in the community quickly, making the TVL further lower. A terrible vicious cycle will form.
A similar example would be Nexus Mutual. They somehow pegged NXM value with TVL and people are not allowed to swap back to ETH when TVL is insufficient to support insurance. It goes well when Nexus Mutual launches as NXM grows when TVL grows. The have a curve indicating the relationship of TVL and NXM price. However, when some other insurance appears and slowing down its growth, their tokenomics collapsed. Many community members lose passions and leave as they cannot sell the NXM back to ETH. wNXM is sold at a 30% discount to NXM and people are still willing to wrap and sell in exchange. When you enter their discord and telegram, it is much quiet than before.
It may not be an exact same comparison. But always think of the case when TVL growth slows down. Don’t let the vicious cycle form. Maybe simply some KPI wth normal TRU distribution is enough. People in crypto world are not patient nor loyal, they will simply go to other protocol when TVL drops, especially when TRU-TVL has some pseudo-leveraging that cause it drops double by the drop of TRU price and drop of TVL.",22,9.4,2021-02-26

I do like the idea of providing incentives via grants though. I think a grant program should reward the behavior that we want to see more of, but don’t directly reward enough through farming and staking today. Key areas that come to mind are:

vetting and rating loans - building systems to help the community make these decisions
contributing to how borrower credit limits and interest rate are set

['[Proposal] Reduce incentives for tfTUSD/TUSD farm'],"Moving a post from #ideas by @tylerw to an official proposal. - [Idea] Reduce incentives for tfTUSD/TUSD farm
Summary:
I propose that the Uniswap tfTUSD/TUSD LP farm emissions be reduced to 10% of the current emissions rate to 15,669 TRU/day, effective March 15, 2021 (two weeks from today).
Background:
When this farm was launched in Nov. 2020, its goal was to provide instant liquidity for users who wished to enter/exit the tfTUSD lending pool. tfTUSD liquidity has drastically improved via Liquid Exit and Uniswap liquidity since launch, and so we should revisit this farm.
How tfTUSD liquidity has improved over the past three months:


Liquid Exit launched and now enables users to withdraw large amounts of tfTUSD for TUSD with minimal slippage. Liquid Exit has been used for >7M TUSD worth of withdrawals.
The tfTUSD/TUSD Uniswap pool now holds ~$17M in TVL and is the 32nd largest Uniswap pool as of today. This pool enables users to get instant tfTUSD liquidity at lower gas costs, making it helpful for users who want to withdraw small amounts of tfTUSD.

Motivation:
Given the improvements above, I argue for reducing incentives to the tfTUSD/TUSD LP farm. I believe we can achieve instant liquidity for tfTUSD holders with much lower incentives in this farm. Lowering incentives for this farm seems to align with sentiment expressed in community discussions .
Specification:
TRU Rewards for the tfUSD/TUSD pool will be reduced from the current rate  of 156,690 per day to  15,669 per day.",22,134.4,2021-03-02

['Amber Group Borrow Request'],"Hello TrueFi community,
Amber Group is a crypto finance company. We were founded in 2015 with the goal to help our clients buy and sell crypto, earn yield, manage risk, and access liquidity. Today, we have one of the largest footprints in the crypto secondary markets.
We’re a team of >200 engineers, quantitative researchers, traders, and crypto enthusiasts on a mission to enable frictionless markets. Operating around the clock and around the globe, we have a presence in Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Taipei, Korea, Singapore, and Vancouver. Servicing the entire ecosystem, our clients include exchanges, token issuers, miners and mining pools, wallets, exchanges, hedge/venture funds and OTC desks. We offer OTC streaming, agency execution, electronic market making, structured products, borrowing and lending across all major coins and altcoins.
On an average day, we trade between $500mm - $2bn in spot, futures, swaps, options and other derivatives. We are major participants on all major spot and derivative exchanges, and manage about $1bn in total trading capital (varies by the day depending on where BTC and ETH is trading!).
We’re a very active borrower/lender in the markets. This is because of our footprint in trading futures and perpetual swaps, whose relationship against the underlying spot market represents an implied interest rate for borrowing/lending. This is also the reason we can regularly be seen on the Bitfinex leaderboard. Expertise in crypto derivatives have allowed us to recently launch a mobile app ‘Amber App’, offering customized interest rate deposits and option-linked structures to our >50,000 Asia based clients across, BTC, ETH and stablecoins (including TUSD).
Similar to other borrowers on TrueFi, we have a market neutral mandate. Our principal trading strategies include, but are not limited to: statistical arbitrage, funding/basis, high-frequency trading, market making, short-term CTA and dispersion strategies, and options trading.
We also have a large footprint in DeFi; outside of lending, staking, yield farming and arbitrage, we have also incubated KeeperDAO together with Talo Systems. KeeperDAO is an on-chain liquidity underwriter focused on MEV [https://twitter.com/Keeper_DAO], which in 3 months time has accumulated a treasury balance of >$35mm, launched a virtual mempool (The Hiding Game) and currently working on integrations with other major DeFi protocols.
Amber is backed by category-defining investors, including Paradigm, Pantera, Polychain, Dragonfly, Coinbase Ventures, Blockchain.com, and Fenbushi. Amber is registered with both FinCen and FINTRAC as an MSB.
We are requesting a borrow of 3,000,000 TUSD for 60 days at 14% annualized interest as our first loan. We have greatly enjoyed working with the TrustToken team over the past 4 years and look forward to growing further alongside the TrueFi community.",52,395.4,2021-02-18

When we launched the protocol we knew that the TUSD/tfTUSD pool was very important, but only in the short term. With Liquid Exit we have now grown beyond it and reducing rewards makes sense.

['Interim Borrower Credit Limits'],"There was recently discussion in discord around some borrowers looking to increase the amount they are borrowing very significantly (some as much as 4-10x their most recent amounts). While this strong demand from borrowers is very healthy for the platform, we need to make sure that the platform is not doing anything risky.
We are prioritizing building out a full credit model that will be verified on-chain. But until then, while we are still voting on loans manually, I would propose the following rules:
1. Borrowers cannot increase their loan size more than 1.5x from their most recent loan
2. Borrowers cannot borrow more than $5mm from the protocol at a time unless they have shared more detailed (and/or ongoing) financial data with TrustToken Inc.
The goal of (1) is to keep the platform safe by forcing each borrower to establish a track record of repayment with TrueFi before taking out larger loans. I am proposing 1.5x because it seems to me to be fast enough to allow borrowers to ramp up to large sizes within a few months, but still slow enough to keep the platform safe. I am open to other numbers such as 1.75x or 2x if folks think that would still protect the platform.
For context on (2), there are tools for viewing aggregate statistics about a trading firm’s exposure and risk (e.g. how much exchange leverage they are using in total) without seeing their individual positions or trades. We believe this type of financial data will be  a valuable input to our credit model (which is under development right now) and can help us to make sure borrowers are not taking outsized risks with this capital.
I’d appreciate hearing folks thoughts on this proposal. Thanks.",35,152.0,2021-03-21

Seems like a pretty slow ramp. Did you want to also specify the max loan size for the first loan? And the loan durations, or could they just borrow for 7 days each time? I think 2x is reasonable. I think $1-2m to start is reasonable. I think a min duration of 30 days probably makes sense. I love the xmargin idea.

And I notice there is a ramp up for 1/1.5mm then to something bigger such as 3mm, and others just ramping up to 10mm, which are multiples 3 to 10.  Any newer entrants at a 1.5x would simply take much longer to build to an ideal size of the loan.
For sizing, if I was a lender, I would be most worried about concentration risk of a particular counterparty versus the whole loan pool.  In an ideal world, there would a exponentially more difficult voting threshold when a higher fraction of the pool would be taken by a single counterparty.
The truth is there is a sweet spot for loan sizes, as the cost of recovery through legal recourse is fixed (thus making smaller size loans oddly troublesome) and too much size just makes everyone lose a couple of winks of sleep at night.",28,5.6,2021-02-27

Of course defaults are inevitable, but why not try to keep an impeccable 0% default streak for as long as possible?

This proposal aims to allocate up to X TRU/weekly to the reimbursement of gas costs for users migrating from TrueFi V1 to V2 and/or moving out of the Uniswap TRU/ETH pool to SushiSwap.
Background
After the team shared their plans to move our TRU incentives from Uniswap to Sushiswap, community members including myself expressed concern (see Discord links below) that prohibitively high gas fees would be a blocker to a smooth migration. This same concern applies to the teams upcoming migration from TrueFi V1 to TrueFiV2. Lenders, Stakers, and LPs should not spend more than what they are making in order to migrate.

Discord Link 1: Discord

Discord Link 2: Discord

Discord Link 3: Discord


Motivation
Gas costs as of late have been a hindrance to TRU Lenders, Stakers, and LPs. The team are keeping an eye on the various scaling solutions being tested by leading DeFi projects and will act when there is a clear winner (Optimism vs ZK-Rollups vs AVAX, etc). Until then, they need to make migrating a simple decision for TrueFi users by subsidising gas costs related to migrating from Uniswap to Sushiswap as well as TrueFi V1 to TrueFI V2.
Specification
Reimbursements would be made in TRU, while gas is priced in terms of ETH, so a conversion is required. The price oracle would be CoinGecko’s API, with the median TRU/ETH price from the week being used for all that week’s reimbursements.
Claims would be made available via the same MerkleRedeem contract currently used in the liquidity mining program. Reimbursements and liquidity mining proceeds for the week would be summed and be claimable in a single transaction.
Poll
To keep this simple, please vote on just 2 options:




YES - compensation should be paid for the cost of migrating between platforms
NO - compensation should not be paid

We have been a consistent borrower from the platform since its inception. We have completed two borrows to date:  one for $1mm which has already been repaid and another for $5mm which is to be repaid this coming Tuesday (16/2).

Summary
Bastion Group is a group engaged in proprietary trading in cryptocurrencies and is led by well experienced traders who moved over from traditional finance including the Twitter handle owner @theskyhopper. We have been in the crypto space since 2017 and we concentrate our trading strategies on mainly on arbitrage, some quant signal trading, and some market making.
We would like to increase our standing and further our credibility with the Truefi community and demonstrate our credibility. We would like to start by requesting TUSD 1,000,000 for a 30 days loan at a rate of 14.5% annualized. We hope we can cultivate a relationship where we can borrow more funds in the future.
About Us / Our Vision
TruefiBitfinexVolume1860×836 45.8 KB
Our trading volume is ranked here at 24th in January under the pseudonym, the Skyhopper.  Please check out this Twitter handle as well!
Bastion came together in 2015 trading equities in Asia by a group of traders who recently left their day jobs and realized that there was a decent chance to be successful outside the traditional finance rat-race.  After a couple decent years trading, in late 2017, we started to transition to cryptocurrencies after discovering significant discrepancies in prices between exchanges.  For example, we found that prices in JPY in Liquid (then Quoine) was at times 8-10% different from US Dollar prices in Bitstamp or Gemini for example.
Those days of such fat margins are over, but there are plenty of opportunities to scalp, and arbitrage.  We are excited to see all the opportunities in DeFi whether it is Uniswap, Sushiswap, Aave and many other platforms.  We are also excited to see an advent of cover markets for these protocols and also for Cefi protocols as well.  With all these tools, we feel more comfortable today to deploy risk capital than three years ago.
We have come a long way in building our equity (we originally funded ourselves with our own money and nearly all of it is still our own equity), and the overall profit ranking in the Bitfinex leaderboard is a testament/evidence of the capital base that we have collectively, which is well over 50 million USD dollars.
Our volumes by no means are the largest in the market, but we can say we are not tiny either.  Risk management, as boring or uncool as it sounds as I write this, is a key component of managing our capital.  This is an area of knowledge we were able to extract – despite all the odds seemingly against this – from cutting our teeth on the trading floors of some major investment banks and trading houses including those like Optiver, JP Morgan, HSBC, and UBS.
We have solid risk management systems and efficient execution systems as well.  Some of which we are even forking our system that can used by the general public
Our plan for the borrowed funds (if approved) is to deploy the capital to enhance our own trading returns, whether it is through deployment in defi, market making, or arbitrage trading.
Interest rate proposal: our proposal reflects a rate we believe is competitive to other unsecured lending protocols such as Celsius (average of in-kind rate and in CEL reward rate is about 14.52%.) Further, we believe in current market conditions a material spread such as +3% to +5% should be paid over say Curve Y pool. With the current Y pool paying an annualized 10% APY (without the CRV reward), we figure that a 14.5% rate would be reasonable using both metrics.
Currently, we see significant opportunity to pay a healthy interest rate that would reward your risk, and we are excited for this opportunity to work with TrueFi and present ourselves to your community.

['Bastion Trading Group Borrowing Request'],"While, we are waiting on a whitelist process/approval to be completed, I will post here just for record some update on our thoughts on the interest rate at this point.  The summary is unless there is a significant market change - we will need to apply with a higher rate than proposed (probably a “duh” statement).  Personally, I have always been fascinated with the process of price discovery.  We are juggling number internally.
Some data points:
AAVE rates:
aaverates822×528 55.3 KB
The average of the current rates across the stable coins, USDT, USDC, TUSD, and BUSD is around 13.5% on the margin (in time).   Longer term for the two largest stablecoins USDT and USDC is 10.75% over 30 days.  Similarly, Y Curve has exhibited similar rates, where the current rate is 16% vs. longer rates I would guess is around 10-12% before CRV rewards.  Other protocols are offering even higher yields.
So, the “overnight rate” we then estimate 14.75% - and longer term is 10.5%  at least looking back 30 days.  By depositing in these, likely,  a lender still takes hold of collateral.  So how much is uncollateralized lending worth?  Materially more.
Lets consider the reference simply to be the average of the two rates 14.75% and 10.5% which by no means in scientific - but this is 12.625%.
What is the traditional finance ratio for secured and unsecured finance?
LQD (Unsecured Mostly Corporate Debt) Dividend Yield: 2.67%
MBB (Agency Mortgage Backed - Collateralized and Gteed) Dividend Yield: 2.05%
HYG (High Yield Corproate Debt): 4.80%
Clearly, there should be a premium to unsecured loans.
Here are some data points above to consider - but really leave the stakers to decide of course.",25,75.0,2021-02-17

I want to have a thread in place to pour some ideas regarding tools that can be built by the community that can help the overall TRU platform.
Ideas:


A webapp that shows the current market borrowers’ rate of all other lending platforms (not sure if every other lending platform has an API to access this data. Maybe the data can be crowdsourced?) This can help community members to be aware of the market APY while approving borrowers request.


An easy to tweet tool with different  canned messages. Things like APY numbers maybe can be accessed programmatically and fed into the tweet generator.

['[Proposal] Increase TRU Staking Rewards'],"Moving a post from #ideas by @tylerw to an official proposal. -[Idea] Improve TRU farming incentives for TRU staking
Summary
As TrueFi v2 1 gets ready to launch and deliver improvements to the TRU staking model 2, it seems that farming incentives should also be improved for TRU stakers.
We believe an additional 100,000 TRU per day for stakers would help making staking more attractive.
Background
Community members have given critical feedback on the current state of staking and it is clear that the rewards do not match the amount of work & gas costs involved with constant staking/unstaking TRU.
Motivation
Increasing this staking incentives should drive more users to stake and start a positive feedback loop for the entire TrueFi protocol. Increased TRU staking can lead to more TFI-LP deposits farming TRU, more loans approved and issued, more fees generated for the protocol, and improved security for the TrueFi lending pool.
Specification
We propose that ~100,000 TRU per day (15.4 TRU per block) are rewarded to TRU stakers over the 90 day period following the contract upgrade.
This would represent an increase of ~16x from the current average rate (~6,000 TRU per day). After the 90 days, the intent is not to end this incentive distribution, just to formally revisit this decision.",34,201.8,2021-02-11

['[Proposal] Increase TRU Staking Rewards'],Agree with @rattlecage . A vesting period for the TRU rewards over say a 90 day period (linear vesting) would be absolutely essential and should be included in this proposal.,30,41.0,2021-02-11

As TrueFi v2 gets ready to launch and deliver improvements to the TRU staking model, it seems that farming incentives should also be improved for TRU stakers.
We propose that ~100,000 TRU per day (15.4 TRU per block) are rewarded to TRU stakers over the 90 day period following the contract upgrade.
This would represent an increase of ~16x from the current average rate (~6,000 TRU per day). After the 90 days, the intent is not to end this incentive distribution, just to formally revisit this decision.
Rationale:
Increasing this incentive to TRU should drive more demand for staking and start a positive feedback loop for the entire TrueFi protocol. Increased TRU staking can lead to more TFI-LP deposits farming TRU, more loans approved and issued, more fees generated for the protocol, and improved security for the TrueFi lending pool.
1600×950 196 KB
In context of TrueFi’s other farming incentives, it seems the TRU staking farm adds the second most value behind the TFI-LP farm (which is currently emitting ~150k TRU per day). The TFI-LP farm and TRU staking farm are the only farms intended to run long-term, and thus they should account for the lions’ share of TRU incentive emissions.
We’re excited about the TrueFi v2 launch and believe being adequately generous in TrueFi’s most important incentives will pay multifold dividends in community size and engagement.
To understand TrueFi’s broader tokenomics plan, and how this proposal fits into it, take a look at this document.
Next steps:
Let us know how you feel about this idea via the vote and discussions below. Community signal and feedback are essential in these decisions on liquidity incentives.

['[Idea] Improve TRU farming incentives for TRU staking'],"Large amounts of TRU staking in itself doesn’t seem very valuable to the platform. The value of staking TRU(to the platform) is in voting on loans and governance proposals, or more specifically, rejecting bad loans and proposals. On-boarding new stakers is useful to the extent that they are smart and care about the long term health of the platform. I don’t think that will happen for a few reasons.


Virtually all votes are one-sided 100% yes affairs(not necessarily a bad thing), which signals to me that the community is basically fine with how the platform is being governed and its hard to imagine new stakers, many primarily looking to APY farm, changing how the platform is run.  The arrow going “earn protocol fees>TFI-LP lending pool” only holds if the new holders are somehow improving governance decisions being made.


Economically, it feels parasitic. Giving TRU to people who already have a lot of TRU rewards existing large existing holders at the expense of new members, other pools and people who just aren’t staking(through dilution). I think we should be very careful with having TRU holders voting to give themselves more TRU.


Growing startups don’t offer big dividends because it attracts the wrong kind of shareholders. If our goal to grow Truefi 10x or 100x over the long term, then the governance structure should incentivize that. This will bring in APY farmers looking to sell as soon as staking incentives drop or someone else offers a bigger APY.


As for an alternative, if the goal is to get more smart people involved in loans and governance, I would reward that directly. Set up a grant or referral program for people who onboard good borrows/lenders or propose good improvements to the platform. This 90 day incentive would cost about 2.7 million dollars worth of TRU.  That much money can incentivize very talented people or run a decently large ad campaign.",39,37.8,2021-02-06
['[Idea] Improve TRU farming incentives for TRU staking'],"@rattlecage Thanks for the thoughtful response. You’re right, the goal is 100% to get more smart people involved in loans and governance. I’d love to hear more ideas on how to run a grant or referral program to help bring more good ideas to the platform. I could see that running in addition to, or in replacement of this farm.
I do think this farm can help though, especially given we’ve set aside TRU for these types of incentives. The TRU/ETH farm on Sushiswap currently provides ~70% APY at the time of writing this. I’d argue this farm needs to be attractive enough to attract TRU into governance (instead of just going to AMMs) because staking TRU creates real value on that platform.
Here are some follow-up ideas on what you wrote above:


Virtually all votes are one-sided 100% yes affairs(not necessarily a bad thing), which signals to me that the community is basically fine with how the platform is being governed


My hope with onboarding new stakers is that we give people more “skin in the game” and reason to take an active role in governance. It’s good to hear that people are happy with how governance is running today, but I think we need to bring more people in to grow TrueFi loans 10x from here.


Giving TRU to people who already have a lot of TRU rewards existing large existing holders at the expense of new members, other pools and people who just aren’t staking(through dilution).


I worry about this too, honestly. On the flip side of this though, I hope that increasing returns on holding TRU encourages a lot more people to farm TRU through the TFI-LP pool. The TFI-LP lending pool still rewards more TRU per day (~150k TRU/day goes to that pool) and it’s open to anyone who deposits TUSD (no advantage for existing TRU holders in that farm).


…This will bring in APY farmers looking to sell as soon as staking incentives drop or someone else offers a bigger APY.


I think this cuts both ways too. Perhaps platforms like Compound and Synthetix gave away too much in incentives to kickstart their growth, but the incentives really did drive hypergrowth on those platforms. The goal here would be to make holding and staking TRU more economically attractive than dumping it. As mentioned above, TRU stakers create value for the platform by vetting new loans, increasing the value of loans the platform can issue, and providing insurance on those loans.",29,30.8,2021-02-08
['[Idea] Improve TRU farming incentives for TRU staking'],"Thank you for the excellent posts @tylerw. I am in support of this proposal (100k TRU/day for TRU stakers in staking V2). I know it sounds like a lot, and I don’t want to see the protocol use TRU frivolously, but I think this is one of the most important farms, if not the single most important farm, because it directly creates utility for TRU. Hence I believe this is one of the best places the protocol can invest its TRU.",26,20.2,2021-02-08
['[Idea] Improve TRU farming incentives for TRU staking'],"The economic value of holding TRU is that if the platform goes up 5x, your TRU goes up that much as well. Look at Sushi or Aave token, for example. Aave gives 8.4% APY and Sushi gives 10%ish, however if you bought those tokens early on you have 5-10xed your investment over the last few months. If people are dumping because they aren’t seeing 50%+ right next to staking, then its a communication issue more than an incentives one.

I do agree the LP farming incentives of TRU make staking less desirable.  I consider that an issue with incentivizing liquidity on governance tokens.

How does people staking TRU grow the loan pool? I guess I am missing that link. TRU staked>???>loan pool grows.

The amount of staked TRU will need to grow to support the amount of loans issued.
In TrueFi today (and v2 staking/rating should work similarly), each loan has to have >= 0.5 TRU staked for every $ loaned (see participationFactor in spec and contract).
In my eyes, growth in TRU staking helps grow the loan pool via two mechanisms:

in order to issue more loans, more TRU will need to be staked. More TRU staked should also lead to better vetting on borrowers and better insurance against bad loans, which makes depositing TUSD in the lending pool more attractive
better returns on TRU actually give people more incentive to deposit into the lending pool: if you want to hold/stake TRU, a good way to acquire TRU is by depositing into the TFI-LP pool and farming (TFI-LP has the highest TRU farm emissions per day)

This is definitely the way to go, as increasing TRU emission by a lot without adding vesting for staking rewards will put a lot of sell pressure from this new released tokens.
The emission rate in TFI-LP and Uniswap pools are quite high, but those involve Lenders and market makers who probably are in for short term rewards. But for governance staking pools, we want to reward long term holders with a higher APY, and the only way to ensure TRU rewards are held long term is to introduce vesting so as to prevent cliffs at the end of each loan period.",24,9.8,2021-02-09

Centralized platforms like Celsius, Nexos, BlockFi and exchanges like FTX are offering higher interests from 11-12% to 15-18% to lenders. Meanwhile, they are demanding higher interest rate for borrowers due to high demand of stablecoins. We as an uncollaterised lending platform shall demand for at least similar rate to these platforms that mostly offer collaterised loans.

['Retro: TrueFi Documentation Error'],"On February 2nd, 2021, TrueFi community member rambo1stbld raised a question on the TrueFi Discord regarding the fact that a recent version of the TrueFi docs said that staking rewards would be multiplied by 50x, whereas in reality, they were only multiplied 1x. As a result, he received less TRU rewards for voting on a loan than he initially expected.
Between November 25th, 2020 and January 9th, 2021, the TrueFi Gitbook documentation incorrectly suggested a multiplier of 50x, compared to the 1-2x multiplier that was actually delivered to TRU stakers. The accurate multiplier (1x) was represented in TrueFi’s smart contracts and the public TrueFi spec during this time. Currently the multiplier has been updated to 2x per a community vote, and our latest version of the FAQs reflects this change.
I take 100% responsibility for this mistake, and I recognize that it has caused issues for users that saw the Gitbook documentation, and not the spec or the smart contracts, and therefore got less TRU rewards than they may have been expecting.
Now (1) a brief timeline on what happened, and (2) how we will aim to avoid mistakes like this in the future.
Timeline: What Happened
The team was considering a potential increase in TRU rewards for staking on loans, and unfortunately edited the Gitbook docs to reflect an increase we were considering, but hadn’t put to community vote or put into effect yet. This did not reflect a change to the smart contracts or to the specification in Github.
Around November 25th, 2020, the team made a change to the emissions multiplier on the TrueFi Gitbook, adjusting “1x” to “50x” as part of a change we were planning. In retrospect, increasing the staking rewards was likely a good call but not quite so much- a later community discussion and vote resulted in the community opting for a smaller increase (2x) with the possibility of larger increases as staking V2 ships in Feb.
On January 9th, 2021, the multiplier error was caught and quickly fixed, returning the variable to 1x, finally accurately reflecting the TrueFi smart contracts.
Our timeline points to a few key moments of communication breakdowns, largely in swapping between multiple platforms (forums, Slack, Gitbooks).
We have two proposals for avoiding human errors like this in the future.
1: Reduce hard-coded information from the FAQs
The first initiative we are planning to take is to update the FAQs and documentation to direct to the smart contracts and reduce or remove hard coded information. Variables in the protocol (such as rewards multipliers) are designed to be easy to change and so it’s easy for external documentation to fail to match what’s on-chain. Thus pointing users to the smart contracts and showing them where to see variables directly is a much safer approach for our documentation. A future alternative could be to pull variables in directly such that docs are updated automatically, but building this is not a top priority right now.
2: Clearer company organization to prevent miscommunications
Second, TrustToken has just finished transitioning to a new organizational structure that has helped us to be crystal clear who’s in charge of what and who needs to sign off. We’ve seen this already improve our execution and make mistakes less likely.
When it comes to publishing documentation, TrustToken has transitioned to Asana for monitoring changes. These alterations are overseen by four key team members. We’ll continue to optimize this process for the right balance of care versus speed.
Finally, we believe that the upcoming move to full on-chain governance will reduce issues of this kind because it’ll provide a single unarguable source of truth for all protocol & parameter changes. Additionally it’ll make any pending changes difficult to miss.

We hope that this post adequately explains what happened and how we’re aiming to reduce the likelihood of similar issues in the future. Please let us know if you have any thoughts or questions.",27,160.4,2021-02-04

Possible Ways to increase TFI-LP liquidity but making TRU/TUSD TFI-LP more popular

Getting a TFI_LP/TUSD liquidity pool listed on CURVE with TRU incentives. CRV is the leader in stablecoin markets and we need to get TFI-LP listed on it immediately to attract more capital

Adding feature on zapper to view TFI-LP staking returns (already available on Debank)
Having support for other front ends, like Aave to allow folks to borrow funds using Aave to lend on TFI-LP directly from TrueFi dashboard. Alpha protocol does this beautifully where they allow users to use Aave to borrow and then lend on their platform (alpha platform) all from Alpha’s frontend.

Change the name of TrueFI LP (TFI-LP) to TrueFi USD (tfUSD) and standardize all future pools around the same format (e.g., TrueFi WETH / tfWETH)
Background/Motivation:
Over the past two weeks or so, have been thinking about how to grow adoption for TFI-LP.
The thinking is that If TFI-LP becomes widely adopted, it will increase pool deposits. For an example of what I’m thinking, see my proposal on the CREAM forum. This post was probably a bit premature, so I’ll try again in the future.
Over time, there will be more TrueFi Pools. Pool 1 (that’s now live) currently accepts only TUSD, but over time will also accept additional USD-backed stablecoins, including USDC. Those two assets can be in the same pool because those assets are basically interchangeable and are both a part of yCRV. If you wanted to borrow/lend wBTC or ETH, you’d need a different pool. Since those pools will probably exist one day, we need a consistent naming and branding convention for all of these pools/corresponding tokens.
Next Steps:
Please vote on the poll here and leave comments if you feel differently. If all looks good, will quickly move to proposal and Snapshot.

['How Snapshot Governance of TrueFi Will Work'],"Introduction
Starting today, we will be moving votes over to Snapshot. This is in advance of adopting fully on-chain governance before the next unlock (optimistically, this will go live in mid-late January).
Goals with this post, the prior post, and of governance generally:

Make the governance process legible and transparent, not necessarily rigid and inflexible. We expect governance will grow and evolve as TrueFi does.
Be nimble (still able to move fast), but also responsible to make sure that governance is doing best by all stakeholders (lenders, borrowers, stakers)

The Steps of Governance:

TrueFi’s primary communication medium is Discord. Nothing on Discord is formal and Discord is a good place to suggest ideas and have informal discussions with community members around proposals related to improving TrueFi. Throw an idea out there and see what kind of feedback you get.
A more formal and better medium for long-form discussion is the forum, specifically the Ideas channel. Once you’ve gathered some preliminary feedback on an idea (Discord, private conversations, Ideas channel) you can move to making a formal proposal.
The proposals channel of the forum is where formal TrueFi Improvement Proposals (“TIPs”) for upgrades and changes to TrueFi and TrueFi governance will be proposed. It will follow a (to-be-finalized) template and should include a poll in the post so that people who don’t want to leave a comment can leave a vote and give indicative feedback of sentiment.
Once something has been discussed on the forum and you believe you have a good understanding of sentiment and the parameters of the vote, it should move to Snapshot.
As of writing this (today, December 18, 2020) we don’t have governance established beyond Snapshot. In the coming weeks,  we will move to formal, binding, on-chain governance (along the lines of Compound), but for the time being will rely on Snapshot to be the final arbiter, as many other projects do.

Once a vote on Snapshot is concluded (again, for the time being), the TrustToken, Inc. engineering team will implement the upgrades or changes.
Details:

The timespan between a forum post and a Snapshot vote should be >= 3 days. We want forum members to have time to be able to leave comments and understand the proposal
The length of a Snapshot vote should be greater than or equal to 72 hours (3 days), but less than or equal to 168 hours (7 days). This gives ample time for votes to be gathered without allowing it to drag on endlessly
Snapshot votes require a quorum of 15% of circulating supply (excluding company unlocked tokens, which will also be excluded from voting). The quorum will be calculated by taking the circulating supply from Coingecko / our API and excluding the unlocked tokens held by the company. So, as an example, if the circulating supply is 129,527,253 then quorum would be 11,274,955, calculated as:

(129,527,253 - 54,360,886)*.15 = 11,274,955


Snapshot votes are executed if a majority (50%+1) votes in favor
When we move fully on-chain governance and enable token delegation, we will also enact a proposal threshold, but for now, we’ll set an arbitrary proposal threshold of 100,000 TRU

There was some contention to this vote on the forum and while it received a few ‘no’ votes, it received a super-majority of ‘yes’ votes. This moved directly to Snapshot and received 80% of the votes ‘for’ decreasing the minimum. Quorum on this vote corresponds to a quorum of about 6%
Ex3: Jack made a post about expedited TIPs (i.e., skip forum go right to Snapshot) for critical updates. He then made one that similar to ex2, received full support with a quorum that would be equal to  ~7%

As will be explained in a soon-to-be-shipped roadmap, these inefficiencies (specifically, the ‘high opportunity cost of voting’) will be improved in February’s TrueFi V2 launch.

This upgrade adds a liquid exit feature allowing for increased liquidity for TFI-LP holders when there is TUSD available in the pol. This upgrade also fixes a bug in TFI-LP price calculation when a loan has been repaid, but not set as closed in the pool contract.
The following changes are going into effect:

Stop using infinite approval in curve
Remove whitelist from TrueLender and require LoanTokens are deployed by borrower instead
Fix loans value calculation (in LoanToken & TrueLender)
Add cooldown on exit to prevent arbitrage
Treat year as 365 days
Add limit to total number of loans in TrueLender (100)
Add view method for claimable and claimed rewards
Restrict loan funding to lender
Fix distributions after empty() was called
Prevent borrower from repaying with surplus
Add liquidWithdraw mechanism
Add reclaim function to LoanToken
Added arg validation and events
Set burn & loss factor in accordance with spec
Set slippage for withdrawing from curve

['Some questions from a noob that wants to start using TrueFi'],"Hey guys!
I just discovered this project and I’m very interesting into join it, but I have some questions. If someone can help me it would be great:


I’m looking for a similar option like Compound or Maker DAO DAI interest Savings to make some money from my USDC, DAI or, in this case, with TUSD. I see that here I can put my TUSD into two pools: lending and liquidity. Reading the FAQ I saw that when I deposit in lending, my TUSD will be used also in Curve to make more money, is that optional? What would be the interest without invest in Curve?


The point 1 is related with this second. I plan to cover my funds using TrueFi Nexus Mutual, but it only would cover a fail of TrueFi smart contract, not Curve. If my funds are in Curve and a bug happens there, I’d lost all my funds even having the TrueFi NXM cover… Because of that, I don’t want to invest the money in Curve, to not lose my protection or having to buy an additional protection for my funds also in Curve smart contract cover in NXM, it would be too much cost.


In summary, I just wanted to know if I just can put my TUSD here with the less risk, and with the funds not going out of TrueFi so my cover works and knowing how much aprox. APY can I make with that.


Thanks a lot",24,119.8,2021-01-22
['Some questions from a noob that wants to start using TrueFi'],"I think the lending pool is a bundle with TUSD lend to large funds and idle money in Curve and it is not optional.
However, I think it shall not be a big problem as in general cases, more than 80% is in TrueFi pool, sometimes even 9x%. Your capital will only expose to Curve’s bug risk for a small portion. Losing all your funds is only possible when no fund borrow money in TrueFi.",24,9.8,2021-01-22

['Some questions from a noob that wants to start using TrueFi'],"Hi! Yes, I think you might not be exactly understanding TrueFi. And that’s ok 
At present, the flow is:
 → Deposit TUSD into the TrueFi pool with the intention of it being lent out to a borrow
 → Since sometimes there is more capital deposited than there are active borrow requests, we want to make sure that the pool is always earning some interest. If TUSD were just sitting there, it would be earning 0%, so we put that TUSD into yCRV where it both earns a yield in $s and in CRV tokens (which the pool farms)

As a start, we would like to borrow 1,500,000 TUSD for 30 days at a rate of 11.5%, and steadily increase this amount as we build Trust with the community.
Who we are
Nibbio was founded in 2017, from a simple observation: trading cryptocurrencies was just the same as trading any other thing, except that everything was still to be done in that space. With our background in developing the most effective, robust and low-latency systems for top tier banks, we knew we could have an edge. And we still do.

Our achievements
•	2017: Nibbio started with market-neutral triangular arbitrage on multiple different exchanges – coding 140 API connectors in 10 months;
•	2019: Nibbio transitioned to run market neutral strategies on perpetual futures and swaps;
2020: Nibbio publicly invested in Bonfida (https://bonfida.com/about) to support Serum, along with other  decentralized projects;
•	2020: Nibbio’s trading volume is above $100B;
•	January 2021: Volume is the highest we’ve ever traded;
•	In 2021: We plan to launch new products – with starting MM and arbitraging Spot across all major exchanges – which will drive our volume even higher.
•	Nibbio’s risk management tools are very resilient and robust, and after 20 months of trading perps, we have never been at risk or liquidated from any venue (even on March 13th, 2020);
•	Nibbio is currently working with all major crypto lenders;
•	Nibbio is partnered with one of the biggest crypto firm which currently works with TrueFi.
Use of funds

['[Proposal] Expedited TIPs'],"Expedited TIPs
Hi TrueFi community, this proposal looks to add upon the framework for TIPs we shared here.
Expedited TIPs will allow time-sensitive proposals to skip the forum discussion phase and go straight to Snapshot. This class of TIPs will be reserved for extreme situations when inaction would lead to significant downside for TRU holders.
Summary
Previously we shared a framework for how TIPs would work and set guidelines for how long each potential TIP needs to be discussed on the forums before moving onto Snapshot. Beyond these procedures, I believe we also need to set standard procedures for “expedited” or emergency TIPs.
Background
The team and community both agree that the current staking rewards are not worthwhile given gas and opportunity costs in crypto, but there is no way to quickly put forth a proposal to address the issue.
Motivation
There are changes to the staking and rewards that should be made ASAP. The longer these parameters stay static, the more stagnant TrueFi growth will be.  Such changes should go directly to Snapshot as an “Expedited TIP”.
Specification
Time sensitive proposal ideas with community support can be fast tracked into Snapshot proposals without first being discussed on the forums based on the discretion of the core TrustToken team. Token holders can veto these proposals by voting “No” on Snapshot.
The ability to publish expedited TIPs will be retired once we transition to on-chain governance.

['[Proposal]: Change loan term max limit to 90-days'],"Summary
This TIP will change the maximum loan duration from 30-days (2678400) to 90-days (8035200).
Background
On January 5th, 2020, I posted an idea to extend the maximum loan duration from 30-days to 90-days.  The community was asked to vote YES if they believed change was a good idea and vote no if they disagreed. 17 users voted YES, and 0 voted NO.
Motivation
Grapefruit Trading is currently borrowing on a 30-day agreement, but we would use the protocol more if we could get the duration increased, and I believe other users feel the same way. The kind of users TrueFi is trying to attract are interested in longer agreements. Having a short duration, such as 30-days, can be a deterrent for larger users who think on a 6-12 month scale.
Specification
This TIP will change the term limits by calling setTermLimits(86400 , 8035200) at 0x16d02Dc67EB237C387023339356b25d1D54b0922.
The first input is the minimum term length, which will be unchanged, and the second input is the new maximum term length of 90-days.
Next steps
A community poll has already indicated unanimously that the idea is good, and the TIP has no changes from the idea.
A Snapshot poll has been created and will be live for five days. If the Snapshot poll reaches a quorum of 15% by the end of the vote, the TrueFi team will execute the TIP. To learn more about how TrueFi handles their Snapshot polls, please check out their post.

['[Proposal] TIP 2: Extend TRU contract Lockout Time by 90 days'],"Summary
Extend the TrustToken contract upgrade lockout time by 90 days in order to avoid being locked out before ownership of the contract is transferred over to the TRU governance contract.
Background
The TrustToken smart contract is upgradable but includes a ‘lockout’ time- after this time the contract can never be upgraded again. This lockout time was meant to help force decentralization of the protocol, which we are moving rapidly towards. Until this lockout time is hit, it can be extended by the owner. Right now the owner is the company multisig but in the future it will be the TRU governance smart contract (see the Github repo) that will own all TrueFi & TRU smart contracts.
Motivation
We’d like the TRU smart contract to be upgradable by TRU governance once it ships, and therefore we need to extend the lockout time at least until the governance smart contract can take over ownership.
Specification
Extend the lockout time by exactly 90 days. We believe that this will be ample time to transfer the TRU smart contract to the new governance smart contracts.

['[Proposal] TIP 1'],"What is a TIP?
TIP stands for TrueFi Improvement Proposal, it has been adapted from the EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal). The purpose of this process is to ensure changes to TrueFi are transparent and well-governed. A TIP is a design document providing information to the TrueFi community about a proposed change to the system. The author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.
TIP Rationale
We intend TIPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions for changes to TrueFi.
It is highly recommended that a single TIP contain a single key proposal or new idea. The more focused the TIP, the more successful it is likely to be.
A TIP must meet certain minimum criteria. It must be a clear and complete description of the proposed enhancement. The enhancement must represent a net improvement.
Preliminary Steps:
Before you begin, vet your idea. This will save you time.
Ask the TrueFi community first if an idea is original to avoid wasting time on something that will be rejected based on prior research. It also helps to make sure the idea is applicable to the entire community and not just the author. Just because an idea sounds good to the author does not mean it will have the intended effect. The appropriate public forum to gauge interest around your TIP is the TrueFi Forum or the TrueFi Discord.
Your role as the champion of the proposal is to write the TIP using the style and format described below, shepherd the discussions in the appropriate forums, and build community consensus around the idea.
Following is the process that a successful TIP will move along
Life of a TIP:
Each status change is requested by the TIP author and reviewed by the TIP editors. If you are moving your TIP to a snapshot or governance portal, please include a link to where people should continue discussing your TIP. The TIP editors will process these requests.

Work in progress (WIP) - Post has been made without adjustments from editors
Proposed - Editor has assigned the TIP a #
Approved - The TIP has passed community governance (at first this is just Snapshot, later on, this will be Snapshot + binding on-chain governance)
Pending Implementation - While we are using Snapshot, we will need to wait for the development team to implement the change
Implemented - The TIP is deployed to mainnet
Rejected - The TIP failed to reach consensus

Template (What belongs in a TIP?):
Please include a clear, concise title beginning with [Proposal]. Additionally, keep in mind that simply suggesting “Do this thing” is not useful or a real proposal

Summary
“If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough.” Simply describe the outcome the proposed change intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.
Background
This section should include any relevant information that the community needs to know before reading the rest of your proposal, such as a short introduction to any concepts that will be discussed. Additionally, this section is an ideal place to clarify points that are within the scope of your proposal and those that are relevant but remain outside the scope of the present proposal.
Motivation
This is the problem statement. This is the why of the TIP. It should clearly explain why the current state of the protocol is inadequate. It is critical that you explain why the change is needed. For instance, if the TIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address why the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This section may also include why certain design choices were made over others and can include data from previous discussions and forum posts.
Specification
This section details how the TIP will solve the problem, and should clearly and succinctly describe how the new feature will be implemented.
Additionally, you should include clearly defined, unbiased For and Against options along with a poll to gauge sentiment.
For:
Against: (often times the ‘Against’ will just be ‘no action taken’)
[Insert a Poll] with the options from the ‘For’ and ‘Against’

History
The TIP document was derived heavily from the SIP Synthetix Improvement Proposal and the yEarn Improvement Proposal documents. In many places, the text was simply copied. In some places, it was copied and modified. Any comments about the TIP document should be directed to the TIP editors.",28,190.6,2021-01-08

['CoinList Integration'],This would be especially useful given so many CoinList users are vesting significant volumes ICO tokens for multiple years. Although the TrueFi loans would still be “uncollateralized” TRU stakers would at least have a greater level of confidence that individuals are accredited and able to eventually pay back the loan in a worse case scenario.,19,3.8,2021-01-07
['Loan duration change'],"Hi everyone,
When the protocol originally launched, the TrueFi team chose to start with a maximum duration of 30 days for loans. I would like to begin an ongoing conversation about extending the maximum duration. Grapefruit Trading is currently borrowing on a 30-day agreement, but we would use the protocol more if we could get the duration increased, and I believe other users feel the same way. The kind of users TrueFi is trying to attract are interested in longer agreements. Having a short duration, such as 30-days, can be a deterrent for larger users who think on a 6-12 month scale.
I suggest extending the 30-day window to 90-days now, and once the first 90-day loan is paid back, the protocol should consider moving to a 180-day window.
Please vote YES on the below poll if you agree the maximum duration should be extended from 30 days to 90 days. Vote NO if you disagree. Comments and feedback are welcomed.

The system accepts repayment, borrower is auto approved for an increased amount (to be decided by community) and user is auto approved for longer term.  The user is given options to “close”, “extend term” (based on community predetermined parameters) and/or “increase borrowing amount”.   This is code, this can be automated. Borrowers would need to be re-assessed once yearly against fraud, negative news, sanctions issues.  On the automated theme… an alert  could be generated that a borrower is approaching 1 year, due diligence is performed by the community based on the community decided process/system/third party, information about borrower is supplied to community so community can decide to vote to continue relationship with borrower.  Community votes to renew relationship or cancel relationship based on yearly due diligence.  Community also needs to be aware of concentration risk to one or a few borrowers.",22,39.4,2021-01-05

['TrueFi Governance'],"The launch of TrueFi to the public was the first step toward building a new decentralized platform for uncollateralized lending that relies on a network of unrelated participants to determine the creditworthiness of borrowers. As stated in the protocol’s introduction, at launch TrueFi’s initial borrowers will be vetted by the TrueFi development team for their creditworthiness. These borrowers have demonstrated a commitment to building a system to decentralize the decision to issue loans and for liquidity providers to have a say in how their capital is deployed. After months of hard work, it is gratifying to see a respected industry participant like [Alameda Research] apply for the first loan from the protocol.
Prior to TrueFi’s launch, the development team committed to a goal of progressive decentralization with the ultimate goal of putting control of the protocol into the hands of its users. In order to meet that goal, the protocol must have a way to allow the community to provide input and decide the best ways to:

Add new lending pools
Vet and approve new borrowers that don’t have a prior relationship with the development team
Add new assets to be loaned and borrowed
Ensure the long-term viability of the platform

The following is an outline for how to transition TrueFi to a community-governed platform.
Like many other decentralized protocols, TrueFi will function best if the community of users who best understand the platform and have its long-term success in mind propose new ideas and build community support for any changes to the protocol. The process should be transparent and allow for community participation.
Over the next few days, the development team will outline a proposed workflow for any member of the community to suggest an improvement, receive feedback, build community support, and ultimately vote on a proposal. Generally, the workflow will follow the following format:
Suggest an Idea

Suggest an Idea on https://forum.truefi.io/ - Members of the community are encouraged to join the TrueFi Forum and submit an initial idea for a change to the protocol.
Engage in conversation with the community and build support for a proposal by taking feedback and resolving critical issues.
Collect documentation to submit a proposal

Submit a Governance Proposal - TIPs
After suggesting an idea and engaging with the community, the next step for any change is proposing a TrueFi Improvement Proposal (“TIP”) by:

Identifying a community member or members willing to lead the effort to prepare, submit, and advocate for “TIP”
Submitting the Proposal to the Forum with documentation that allows the community to clearly understand what changes will be made as a result of the “TIP”.
Work with community members to prepare the Proposal for a community vote.

Community Vote
Once a “TIP” has been vetted and includes all the necessary documentation for a vote the Forum’s Community Managers will submit the “TIP” to the community to vote. The development team is currently hoping to implement Snapshot as a mechanism for holders of TRU to vote on proposals.
Conclusion
The development team will include more details on the format and process for submitting Proposals by drawing on the existing best practices in decentralized governance. In the meantime, please add any comments and suggestions in the comments to this post.",56,671.2,2021-01-06

Thanks for your post. We learned about TrueFi about a month ago  when we were doing some research on TUSD. We have since invested in TRU, Uniswap TFI-LP/TUSD lending pools and the Truefi lending pool.

Regarding interest rates, I would argue that as our balance sheet is a function of the cash flows from our operating business, which is a stable long established industrial business, our risk premium should be lower than lending to any leveraged crypto investment counterparties.

['[Idea] TRU Value Accrual - Staking Rewards in TUSD'],"Hi TRU Community,
I would like to propose a change to the TRU token that gives TRU stakers a claim on fees accrued by the TrueFi protocol.
Currently, active participants of the TrueFi protocol (stakers) are only earning rewards denominated in TRU and there no other forms of value accrual to the token other than Buy & Burns.
The details of the proposal can be found below:


TRU stakers start earning a cut of the fees that the protocol charges (ALL of the .25% loan origination fee in TUSD – which is also being discussed on the forum here).


TRU payouts & incentives for staking on the specific loans remain unchanged.


These staking rewards will accrue over the term of the loan (in TUSD) and will be claimable on a regular basis.



What this would look like in practice:
Loan ($1,000,000, 12% , 30 days)


Let’s say the origination fee is 0.25% of the loan principal. $2,500 will be collected as origination fee. Assuming that all the stakers had staked a total of 1,000,500 TRU (1,000,000 TRU as yes, and 500 TRU as no). Apart from the TRU rewards and payout stakers would also receive 0.00249 ($2,500/ 1,000,500) for every TRU staked.


If you had staked 10,000 TRU (value = $1,500) you would receive $24.987 TUSD ( 1.67%  30-day ROI or 20% annualized).


This gives TRU an explicit form of value accrual and helps to answer the question of “What can I do with my TRU?”

The case against relying on Buy & Burn:
As some of you have pointed out, the buy & burn model is outdated and fails to reward protocol stakeholders fairly according to their level of contribution back to TrueFi. Not all tokens holders deserve the same rewards.
When we spend protocol fees to buy & burn TRU off the open market we are rewarding all TRU holders equally, no matter if they are an active contributor, TA trader, or random speculator.
The proposed change would skew rewards towards the active participants (stakers) that are driving the protocol forward, and gives token holders a clear reason to care about governance (fee-adjustment).
Discussion:
Let us know how you feel about this proposal. Would love additional feedback.
Once this idea has been finalized, it will become our first snapshot governance poll. TRU token holders will then be able to vote in an explicit form of value accrual.

['[Idea] TRU Value Accrual - Staking Rewards in TUSD'],"Thanks Jack.
100000% support this proposal.  It is a GREAT idea and will really help push TRU holders to participate in the loan approval process.
Here are some additional suggestions:

Change the loan approval period from 3 days to “whenever the loan reaches exactly 100% staked”.   Right now, the loan approval period means almost nothing since you need 1 TRU for every $1 of the loan amount.  If after 3 days, there aren’t enough TRU staked, the loan can’t be approved anyways.  So why even bother putting a set time period?  Just make the loans automatically approve once 100% of the TRU is staked.

Also, by changing the time period from 3 days to “enough TRU staked” on the loan – you will guarantee that the APY will be consistent with the example you gave above.  In your example, of a $1,000,000 loan – if there are 2,000,000 TRU staked by the end of the 3-day period, your APY is reduced by 50%.   That greatly diminishes the whole purpose of what you are proposing.  By fixing it so that the loan approves after the exact number of TRU needed is staked, you protect the APY of the TRU stakers on that loan.
Also, this prevents extra TRU that could be staked on the next loan from being wasted on the current loan that has already met the threshold.  Why would we even let 2M TRU stake a $1M loan?  What about the next loan?  What if the next loan needs that extra 1M TRU to stake on it for approval?  It’s just really inefficient.

While I love the idea of giving 100% of the loan fees to the TRU stakers, I would go one step further and give a small % of the loan’s APY to the stakers as well.   Maybe 10% of the total APY can go to the loan stakers at the maturity of the loan.  So a 12% APY would give 10.8% APY to the lenders and 1.2% of the APY to TRU stakers.  It’s not a significant amount but I think that it would encourage even more people to participate.  In the end, isn’t that what we’re all striving for?   If we find that there is more participation than we need, we can always remove that extra incentive later.  But I would err on the side of giving the TRU stakers MORE incentive right now than less to start.

I agree with @Kenny’s tweaks too, especially suggestion #1.
I think we encourage more people to stake TRU by preventing dilution. We could increase the ratio of TRU staked per TUSD lended if we want more TRU staked as insurance on each loan. I think it’s fine if we decide later that 2M TRU should be staked per $1M TUSD loaned.
I do think having a time limit on loans make sense… Otherwise, people would need to un-stake their TRU from loans that never go live. It’d be a simpler system if TRU was locked until the loan staking expired or the loan was paid back.",36,22.2,2020-12-18

Instead of giving the fees to the TRU stakers in the form of TUSD – why don’t you BUY the TRU using the fees and/or interest APY from the loan from the open market and reward the stakers with more TRU.   This will help support the price of TRU and also put more TRU in the hands of the stakers.  I think that’s a double-win.

Your example used 10,000 TRU, which is $1400 at todays price - which probably represents a regular user. In your example, they would receive $24.987 TUSD for that loan. Which IMO is a good amount for the investment/risk and work involved to participate.

['Changes to the current Origination fee structure'],"Currently the TrueFi protocol charges a flat fee of 0.25% as loan origination fees. It does not take into account the term period of the loan. Borrowers are paying the same fees irrespective of term of the loan. We feel that this fee structure is disincentivizing short term loans.
The idea is to make the origination fees a function of term which removes the disincentive against shorter term loans.
Possible ideas for the new structure are:


Make it completely dependent on the term of the loan.
Example: If the origination fee is 0.125% for every 30 days. A borrower would be paying $1,250 (0.125% x $1,000,000) for 30 days and $625 (0.125% x $1,000,000 x (15/30)) for 15 days as origination fees.


Add a fixed fee which is irrespective of term along with a variable rate which depends on the term of the loan.
Example: On top of a variable origination fee of 0.10% for every 30 days, we can also add a fixed fee of $250. A borrower would be paying $1,250 (0.1% x $1,000,000 + $250) for 30 days and $750 (0.1% x $1,000,000 x (15/30) + $250) for 15 days as origination fees.


Keep origination fee the same as what it is currently. Flat 0.25% of loan principal irrespective of loan term.


Please vote accordingly to suggest a suitable structure for origination fee.

How about an annualized fee but with a minimum number. The idea is to discourage short term loans by setting a floor.
Maybe a 5 bps minimum and an annualized number of 50 bps?
It might not be the right numbers, but I think the format is good.",34,6.8,2020-12-15
['Changes to the current Origination fee structure'],"I might be in the minority here but I believe “discouraging” short-term loans means “encouraging” long-term loans.  There is nothing wrong with encouraging long-term, high-interest lucrative loans.  Traditional banks would LOVE to get a long-term, reliable, paying client over the next 30 years (mortgages today).
I actually LIKE the idea of encouraging long-term loans that pay high interest for a longer duration than 15-30 days.  What’s wrong w/ that?
Short term loans are fine for smaller clients whose credit is less established but will pay us a high interest.  Ever notice why Credit Card APY’s are so high even for good-credit borrowers (20-30%).
Also, there’s a misconception that short-term loans means more liquidity.  That is completely untrue.  You’re investing in CRV and other yield places with the money in the lending pool today.  In essence, you’re already putting the funds in short-term loans (loaning to other pools/platforms).  When a lender redeems today, they’re NOT getting TUSD back – they’re getting whatever is in the lending pool anyways.  So in essence, you’re not really offering these lenders “liquidity”.
If you did offer TRUE liquidity, you would give these lenders back the same TUSD they put in when they redeem.  But you’re not.  You’re giving them either 1) option to sell their tokens back on UNI and take a hit on the slippage or 2) get whatever’s in the pool.  They’re NOT getting TUSD back directly from the pool anyways.  So you’re NOT offering liquidity or flexibility.
So where  exactly is the rationale that “shorter term loans = more liquidity/flexibility” coming from?  I’m confused about that.  For those who put money into the lending pool, it makes no difference if the company chooses to invest in short term or longer term loans because no matter what, they’re not directly getting back the TUSD they put in from the lending pool either way.  If the reasoning for wanting short-term loans is that it offers more liquidity, then it is flawed reasoning.  Short term loans do not offer any more liquidity to a lender than long-term loans.",32,56.4,2020-12-15
['Changes to the current Origination fee structure'],"Shorter term loans would be more liquid because if someone is holding a loan token they would be able to redeem the loan token for TUSD in a shorter time period. Pool participants would prefer to hold loan tokens which are redeemable in 14 days or a month as compared to holding a loan token for a year.
This is one of the ideas behind encouraging shorter terms, other motive is to build a track record of repayments to generate confidence in our protocol.",29,25.8,2020-12-16
['Changes to the current Origination fee structure'],"If someone needed to redeem their Tokens, I’m sure they need their TUSD back right away – not after 14 days.  yes, the term is shorter but if you’re redeeming  your token, you most likely need the cash NOW – not 14 days later.  14 days vs 1 year would make little  difference if you urgently need the TUSD now.
So you would have to sell your tokens to get the liquidity right away.  Most people you ask are probably not going to be OK holding a loan token for 14 or 30 days if they need that TUSD now.   Wait 14-30 days to get their money – or take the hit on the slippage on UNI?  I suspect the lender will bite the bullet and eat the slippage.  So I think you’re missing the point if you think shorter loan terms solves or even mitigages the liquidity problem.
I do agree that having a track record would be helpful but once again – you have whitelisted borrowers with some name recognition.  I think track record would be much more significant for un-whitelisted borrowers without a recognizable name like Alameda.
I understand the reasoning – I just don’t agree with them.  Just my 2 cents.",27,10.4,2020-12-16

First, I would highlight the fact that the community votes so if a proposal is irrelevant according to the community, it will be known.
Second, to put it in a nutshell, with proportional interest rate :
-short terms loans are more liquid but dedicated to short-term trading persona  only which is quite restrictive ;
-long term loans are less liquid but may attract more mid-term trading persona and thus open room for new loans ;
Depending on the borrower’s profile, both should be available from 14 days up to 6 months or more, the community being the final decision-maker ",21,4.2,2021-01-01

We are Alameda Research, a full-service crypto trading firm offering an institutional-grade OTC RFQ system, fiat support, and near-universal coverage of cryptocurrency products.

We are the first borrower on TrueFi and are looking to expand our usage of the platform substantially in the future. The total amount we have loaned so far is $15mm, with $5mm of it successfully repaid and $10mm currently outstanding.

We are excited about TrueFi, and we are interested in borrowing 1,000,000 TUSD for 30 days at a rate of 11.5%. If the loan is a success, we will likely make larger requests in the near future.
About us
Grapefruit Trading was started in March 2018 by Mike Komaransky, an early crypto investor who previously founded Cumberland Mining. Grapefruit is a subsidiary of a larger Chicago Trading firm 4170 Trading. Grapefruit’s focus is trading a wide variety of cryptocurrencies with a specialty in trading derivatives.
Grapefruit has been an early adopter of DeFi applications and continues to spend a significant amount of time and resources participating in the ever-changing space. Although we will not disclose private information, we can share our public accomplishments:


We were the second Airswap OTC provider and were responsible for many of the first large trades on the platform in early 2019. Airswap built the technology for instant swap OTC trades to eliminate counterparty delivery risk.


Grapefruit was the first OTC desk to become a Wrapped Bitcoin merchant and has to date minted 15764.69 WBTC (~$300M) and burned 1694.5 WBTC (~$32M). Coindesk cited us in an article back in September for the surge in WBTC supply.


We completed the first-ever DAO OTC trade, in which the Yam treasury exchanged $250k of YFI’s yUSD token for DPI.


Grapefruit Trading LLC is registered with FinCEN as a money services business for our OTC trading.
Use of funds
At Grapefruit, we primarily put on delta-neutral trades, which means the borrowed funds will not be used to take directional exposure in any tokens (long or short). Funds are typically used in a range of spot, derivatives, and DeFi trades. Grapefruit participates in many DeFi protocols but will only allocate significant capital to those that have been thoroughly vetted and have a long history of success. As for exchange risk, we carefully considered which exchanges to store funds on. We also have internal risk limits for the exchanges we participate on to limit our risks to any one exchange.

We wish to use the funds for our market neutral, market making trading strategies. These strategies are used to generate volume on exchanges and are completely hedged (i.e. do not have any risk relating to cryptocurrency price movements). Hedging is done either on the same exchange using futures contracts or cross-exchange in the same market.
Our counterparties for these trading activities include major cryptocurrency exchanges such as FTX, Binance and Bitfinex.

There is no incentive to HODL TRU except for potential price appreciation.
I think the first and most important thing to do is reduce the total supply.  When a new investor looks at a project and sees 1.4 BILLION coins max supply, it scares the crap out of them.  Esp when you add in the fact that a huge portion of it will be given away (40%) as rewards and another 20% to the team (now and future).  Not to mention all the whales that bought in the presale and 7/8 still waiting to be unlocked.  It’s not an attractive proposition.
YFI is the perfect example of a successful token structure.  YFI team got 0% of YFI tokens allocated to them.  There were 0% presales.  It was a fair launch.  Andre himself didn’t get allocated any YFI.  That’s why YFI is worth $30,000 each today.  They are a DeFi token that did it right.

It’s relatively simple and doesn’t involve as much intervention by the team once its been implemented. Investors are justifiably spooked by the total supply and I just don’t see a purpose for having 1.4 billion governance tokens.
In terms of a SAFU fund, doesn’t this effectively mitigate risk for TFI-LP’s? If the fund is implemented I think the protocol needs to increase fees for assuming extra risk.",30,26.0,2020-12-09
['Proposal: Use half of protocol fees to buy-and-burn TRU'],"The current TRU token economics are straight out of a 2017 “standard” ICO playbook (pre-DeFi).  The problem is, it’s 2020 and Defi Tokens economics look nothing like this.
When 60% of your outstanding tokens (30% pre-sale, 30% company/team) are centralized, it’s a really tough sell.   The product can even be good, but no one will want to invest in the tokens.
I think the “gold standard” for token economics in 2020 is YFI.
YFI had no “company/team” tokens.  It was 0%.
YFI distributed 100% of their tokens to people who used their protocol in a fair and distributed manner.
It had no inflation after the tokens were distributed early on.  Once the tokens were fully distributed in the first month, that was it.  If you wanted it, you had to buy it.  There was no more inflation.

['Further Reduction of TRU Farming - Feedback Wanted'],"Hi Everyone,
The TrustToken team wanted to propose a few more tweaks to the TRU emission schedule based on what we’ve heard and observed in Discord.
Here is where we stand now after the previous reduction in TRU rewards across the various farms:
TRU Rewards 2.0 (Updated Dec 3)1862×590 54.8 KB
The Nexus Mutual reward allocation has already been cut in half  from what was originally planned and there have been no complaints against it, the plan for now is to leave it be.
We have a great amount of borrower demand right now and should  continue incentivize the TrueFi Lending pool and TRU stakers as both participants are needed to make additional loans.
To clarify, the APY for the TrueFi Lending Pool is well above 100% at the time of this writing (~132%) and NOT the 8.19% displayed at https://app.truefi.io/farm, this is an UI error and we are rolling out a fix shortly.
You can double check the current APYs across all our farms with this nifty tool built by a community member (credit to: VFat?) -  https://vfat.tools/truefi/
TLDR - Lending pool APY is higher than displayed. Some pools are more useful to TRU holders than others, more TUSD deposits leads to more/bigger loans which benefits TRU token holders. Let’s lower rewards for pools that don’t benefit TRU holders and focus on the growing the lending pool and loan volume
The following is what we’d like to propose for each of the remaining farming opportunities, once we get some initial feedback this will be formalized into the first TrueFi Snapshot Proposal:



1. Reduce rewards for  Uniswap ETH <> TRU Pool by:


50%
75%
100%
None of the above [Please propose alternatives]




0
voters




Reasoning:
Majority of TRU/ETH liquidity right now is being provided by TrustToken team, further reduction of these rewards would be beneficial for rest of TRU holders.
Former TRU/ETH LPs can move into TrueFi Lending Pool for more stable yield with much less price exposure.



2. Reduce rewards for Uniswap TFI-LP/TUSD pool by:

15%
20%
25%
None of the above [Please propose alternatives]




0
voters




Reasoning:
After listening to your feedback we realized that Uniswap is not the optimal place for a pool like this, slippage/price impact can be significant for large swaps. This plan is to slowly phase out this pool in favor of a native TrueFi pool that will enable lenders sell their pool tokens back to the TrueFi Lending Pool for TUSD.  More detail on to come on this.
We’re looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",60,242.0,2020-12-04

I could be supportive of  another 30 days of farming at most but beyond there, there’s little value to be had and there’s also the issue of those newly minted coins creating sell pressure on the TRU token.

It depends on which farm you want to use… to directly stake on loans, no there are no other tokens you need. If you want to farm the ETH/TRU farm, for example, you’d need ETH as well.

@Jacks - I actually would propose reducing the TFI-LP farm as well. We just shipped a fix for the APY calculations in the dashboard and it’s currently around 120% APY. This may drop when people realize how favorable it is, but I think it’s still a case of better to farm valuable TRU than lots of cheap TRU. Thus I’d propose a significant reduction in this farm, e.g. 50%. Ultimately I think this will be better for the community & the protocol long-term.

['Aave Credit Delegation Integration'],"Credit Delegation is a feature of Aave which allows a Credit Delegator to delegate the credit of their account’s position to a Borrower. This newly implemented feature presents an interesting opportunity for TrueFi to be the Borrower in which users of Aave delegate the credit of their account’s position to.
A natural synergy between TrueFi and Aave becomes clear. TrueFi currently lacks the liquidity to fulfill many borrow requests at once while Aave users lack the ability to vet borrowers securely and mitigate the risk of default. By utilizing the sea of liquidity on Aaave, TrueFi can focus on delegating capital efficiently and providing a legal framework for enforcing action against delinquent loans.
I believe credit delegation will be an increasingly important sector of DeFi going forward and by failing to integrate with Aave, TrueFi risks losing market share to future competitors that utilize the Aave credit delegation feature to have access to potentially hundreds of millions of dollars of liquidity.

if the protocol is in dire need of liquidity (prolonged liquidity shortage, for whatever reason) and the supply APY is not high enough to satisfy the liquidity providers, some stable rate loans might undergo a procedure called  rebalancing . `


If an user’s loan was taken at a stable rate that is too low for the current market conditions, the protocol might decide to move the stable rate to the current (higher) one to provide a more competitive supply rate for depositors. Eventually, as the market situation normalises, the user will be rebalanced back down to a more appropriate stable rate. The current condition to rebalance is the following: a stable rate loan can be rebalanced if the stable borrow APR accrued by the loan is lower than the current supply APY.

Current emissions:

When I look at our current rate of emissions, two farms stand out as being potentially too high: the Uniswap Eth/TRU Pair (518,375 TRU/day) and the Balancer BAL/DAI/TRU Pool (377,000 per day).  For both pools, the protocol may be over-paying compared with the value it is receiving. This can be seen in the very high APYs those two pools are receiving:
image1173×759 51.9 KB
Is capital in those Uniswap and Balancer pools really worth 200-400% APY to the protocol? Likely not.
Thus, if there is community interest in reducing emissions, I would make the following proposal:

Reduce Uniswap ETH/TRU Pair Emissions by 60% (this would bring it down to 207,350 TRU/day)
Reduce Balancer BAL/DAI/TRU Pool Emissions by 70% (this would bring it down to 113,100 TRU/day)
Decrease Uniswap TFI-LP/TUSD Pair Emissions by 5% (this would bring it down to 208,921 TRU/day)
Leave TrueFi Lending Pool Emissions the same

['Poll: Proposal for Reducing TRU Emission Rate'],"Hi Rafael,
I wanted to chime in here because I think you’re missing the full picture.
Right now, the company is farming its own tokens heavily.  Essentially, the company has its thumbs on the scale and can farm more (and decrease APY) or farm less (increase APY).   We saw an example of this today where the company decided (without warning) to farm WAY more and the APY dropped from 750% to 190% almost immediately.  If the daily emission is 1.5M tokens but the company farms 99% of it and burns it all, the daily emission is tiny.  Only 1% of that 1.5M tokens actually go to the farmers.   Does the emission really even matter if the company can dial their farming up or down  whenever they want to (without warning) and almost completely control the APY?
Since the company can arbitrarily (and without notice) change how much they farm, it leaves degen farmers out in the dust if one day, the company decides to farm more and another day, it decides to farm less.  This goes against the spirit of decentralization and free markets – as well as transparency (all virtues of a good cryptocurrency).
I think the goal here should be to:

Stop the company from farming their own tokens (take thumbs off the scale).
Create an emission schedule that the company is comfortable with and let the free market forces decide the APY.  If that emission schedule is too high or low, you can always amend it with governance and let the community decide what it should be.  But none of that matters until you do step 1).

Creating a fair marketplace that is fully decentralized, transparent and community driven should be the goal of every good cryptocurrency.   You can’t achieve this if you’re arbitrarily farming your own tokens.
Just my 2 cents.
Ken",44,63.8,2020-11-25
['Poll: Proposal for Reducing TRU Emission Rate'],"Hey Kenny, if the community votes in favor of the company never farming (even though for the first 6 months the company is burning or contributing back all farmed tokens) I’m OK with that. But I believe that right now the company being able to make adjustments in response to community feedback is of great benefit to the ecosystem.
Take last night: I believe there was widespread agreement in the community that yesterday too many TRU tokens were coming onto the market and this was hurting the ecosystem (see this poll). The company could quickly respond by increasing its own farming (while actual protocol changes take longer) and I believe this is the reason last night went better than it otherwise might have.",43,43.6,2020-11-25
['Poll: Proposal for Reducing TRU Emission Rate'],"Adding onto Kenny’s comments -
First, in regards to the current proposal to reduce emissions, I think we should reduce the rewards more  severely for BAL/DAI/TRU pool than the others.  It has a lower risk of IL due to TRU price (2% TRU) and we should be rewarding those that LP’d in the riskier  ETH/TRU pool.
I also agree that TT should reduce farming of TRU and eventually cease completely. Beyond that, I think locking up farmed TRU for a short period would alleviate some of the immediate dumping , this also gives consideration to  the early investors who still have a large portion of locked TRU.
Positive sentiment for TRU = new loans being made, loans being repaid, and big-time borrowers talking about us. Since we are dealing with real counter-parties, this process isn’t instant.  It’s a different timeline than most DeFi users might be use to. A weekly cadence for claiming is more fitting for the TrueFi product flow, IMO.
TRU rewards can still accrue in real-time for everyone, but we could make it so farmed TRU can only be claimed weekly? or maybe bi-weekly.
Also, since staked TRU gets locked up for duration the loan it is staked on, having a short lockup for TRU LPs seems to be fair in my eyes.

I believe this debate is largely philosophical.  I’ve been in cryptocurrencies a long time.  Blockchains (and thereby cryptocurrencies) in general are:

Trustless
Decentralized
Immutable

If you have to “trust” the company to intervene whenever “it deems” appropriate to control emission, then you’re not truly trustless or decentralized.  You have to rely on the company to jump in when it feels there is too much emission.   The final voting by the community didn’t even take place to decide if, when or how much the emission was to be reduced and for which pools.  The company decided that on its own, by interveneing and farming more of its tokens, without a vote.
I understand that the “intentions” may have been good.  But “good intentions” are subjective.  What was good for some may not have been good for others.  Those who were farming ETH/TRU and took on IL risk, just saw their APY plummet from 750% to 190% in minutes without a vote or a say in the decision to drop the APY in various pools.",42,78.4,2020-11-25

The balancer pool poses little IL risk whereas the ETH/TRU UNI pool poses severe IL risk.   The risk/reward ratio makes no sense here.
More risk (ETH/TRU Uni pool) = more rewards.
Less risk (Balancer Pool) = less rewards.
And in this case, the difference between risk profiles are extreme.   There’s a 50% exposure to TRU in Uniswap but only a 2% exposure to TRU in Balancer.   That’s like a government guaranteed Treasury bond paying a higher APY than an unsecured corporate junk bond.",41,28.2,2020-11-25

For the balancer farm, I’m proposing that we turn the farm off. Multiple community members have pointed out that the value this farm provides to the protocol is little to none. I think a reasonable alternative would be to significantly reduce this farm, but I think it’s valuable for us as a community to be willing to identify something that isn’t actually helping the protocol and cut it off.
I know that many of these changes do not go as far as some community members would like- the median vote tends to be centrist. But I believe that with steady progress in the right direction, we’ll get to a very good place.

['💬 Feedback on the updated farming rates'],"I don’t think we should completely turn off the Balancer pool, I think any pool we should reduce slowly, instead of turning anything off quickly. Changing any farm to 0 could have unexpected consequences.
For the TRU stakers, we need there to be sufficient APY returns to incentivise voting. So I think it should be much higher than it is now, otherwise we might not have enough voters in the future.
Also keep in mind anyone can create an account here. Why not start using snapshot so only TRU holders can vote on significant changes to the protocol?",39,57.8,2020-11-29

But something like a loyalty program would be a significant amount of new smart contact development work- and we’re trying to build a lending protocol, not a farming protocol. The farming program is meant to accelerate growth, but we should be putting our engineering efforts into build a great lending protocol, not making the farming more sophisticated.
We all ultimately win if we make the world’s best lending protocol.

['Long term LPs that deposited before Block X will receive Y% of the tokens designated for burning'],"Hi @rafaelcosman - my apologies for the slow reply to your questions. Work and family commitments!
By early LPs, I was not explicitly referring to  Uniswap ETH/TRU pool - although that one did provide the most risk. I have seen your second reply regarding the early folks. I just felt that the people that were there at launch/early days to help you get the wheels turning on the project should get some recognition. If no one had turned up and invested at launch, we would probably not be discussing this right now 
Regarding your your point on IL in the Uniswap ETH/TRU pool - I’m more than happy to hodl - but I don’t see it at simple as that. It’s not just the TRU price coming back… With many of your pre sale investors using this pool to cash in their big bags of TRU coins for ETH (which was why this pool was needed at launch?) - my amount of ETH has significantly reduced, and I cant see that ratio coming back with any amount of hodling - unless TRU really moons. Happy to share my stats (attached below). Even ignoring the TRU price difference (at I bought mine at launch!) how long before my ETH gets back to 5.22?

['Long term LPs that deposited before Block X will receive Y% of the tokens designated for burning'],"Hey @leecrowhurst- I see what you’re saying. Wouldn’t TRU just have to get back to the same price you entered at (when denominated in ETH) in order to erase your IL? Based on how I understand Uniswap to work, once TRU is back at that price you should have the same number of ETH as you started with when you added liquidity to the Uni pool.
Second, while we could do some payment here, I’d sooner do it in the stablecoin that the protocol is collecting rather than TRU, because I think the very reason TRU is trading at a low price and you have IL is that too many TRU been put into circulation, primarily from farming. Adding more TRU to circulation will only make this worse. In general, I think giving out TRU can be a trap because while it feels like free money coming from the protocol, it ultimately comes out of the pocket of TRU holders such as yourself.",21,34.2,2020-11-29
['Increase Staking incentive for native TRU stakes'],"Hi @rafaelcosman, it seems like based on the amount of TRU being locked for vouching for loan, the incentive for stakers who are staking their TRU against loan is much smaller than expected. I wanted to propose introducing a staking multiplier to incentivize staking long term. It can be based on time the TRU is locked and allow stakers to withdraw before the loan period ends but with sufficiently lower TRU rewards. The rewards of early TRU withdrawers can also be distributed to folks staking theit TRU longterm to further incentivize staking.
We need to incentivize TRU holders more than other pools and by the looks of it thats not happending right now. I would request the team to consider this request and the community to make other suggestions.",29,80.8,2020-11-28

['Investors Forgotten via Token Economics?'],"I know we’re still early but it’s pretty clear that old supporters of TrustToken have pretty much been left in the dust and new entrants are being scared away by the current token economics.
We funded a long window of development, rollout, and this massive pivot into DeFi, but now we are hit with unfavorable economics that the community is starting to notice.
On top of having to wait 2 years to receive all tokens (after 2.5+ years of previous waiting), I believe there are ~1.5M new TRU minted DAILY. I’m a patient person and investor and vest periods are fine with me – but this kind of thing pushes the limits on that when you sit on the sidelines knowing that value will inevitably melt away to newcomers often looking for a quick flip. It’s just too much.  TVL and other metrics can go up, great, but this is looking like a CRV (Curve.Fi) situation and that really hurts the foundation of a project. Moreover, locked/vesting tokens cannot be staked, so old investors cannot even try to recoup some of that value lost in other areas.
Why can’t projects focus on value accrual and scarcity like YFI? Wide distribution can still occur with scarcity, but many people just want to hand out their tokens like candy…
It feels like it’s too late to propose something to prevent this, but I’d like to get this out there, since I know it’s a growing concern across the community (both old supporters AND new entrants).
I will say, the app itself and the concept have a ton of potential and the TrustToken team has been very helpful and wonderful. A lot of the concerns simply boil down to token economics. Has the TrueFi team discussed altering this at all? I believe there are supply burns that occur but is it really enough?",44,273.8,2020-11-23
['Investors Forgotten via Token Economics?'],"Ive raised it many times in the trusttoken forum and I think it would only be fair to allow private sale investors to be able to stake their locked tokens.
I understand there are technical blockers such as the inability to transfer locked tokens to someone else in the case of a tru stake/vote… maybe a way would be to allow locked tokens to be farmed only?
What do you think? I think we should move this to a proposal quite rapidly so that we dont lose much of the early comers advantage…",49,29.8,2020-11-23
['Investors Forgotten via Token Economics?'],"Hey folks, I think the concerns about the rate of TRU emission from the farms are legitimate. Note though that reducing TRU emission will likely also reduce the APY of the farms and therefore may slow the growth of the protocol.

['Investors Forgotten via Token Economics?'],"Hey Rafael,
I think you should add an option on the vote that includes:
Release the newly farmed TRU on an unlock schedule.
I think this solves the issue of the APY as well as prevent newly farmed TRU from being sold right away and hurting the price of TRU.
I don’t know what the appropriate locking schedule for farmed TRU should be, but I do think that allowing those TRU to be sold on a schedule makes sense to me.
I also think the APY for the ETH/TRU pool actually needs to be the same or even HIGHER.  The risks that LPs provide right now from the impermanent loss (due to the crash in the price of TRU) really makes it difficult for someone to farm TRU profitably.    That’s why you see a lot of LPs pulling out (I believe over $1M net removals just today) and selling all of their TRU (and hurting the price further).",35,12.0,2020-11-25

Tokens are burned- Increases scarcity
Reward them as lottery prizes- ie for every 1 token you deploy in the system, gives you 1 lottery ticket.
Somehow create a locked fund staking them which pays dividends to participants in the network.

I’m Rafael Cosman, Co-Founder and CEO of TrustToken. At the same time, I’m just another TRU holder and participant in the future of TrueFi.
While the launch of TrueFi was only a few hours ago, we’re extremely pleased with how it’s going so far.
Now that TrueFi is live, the first large loan is being deployed, and liquidity is flowing into Uniswap and Balancer, we will be embarking on the process of progressive decentralization so that the protocol can be controlled by its users.
Over the coming days and weeks, we will spend time outlining how governance of TrueFi will work, which will include how we as a community:

Add new pools
Approve new borrowers
Add new assets for borrowing and lending
Develop new types of loans such as lines-of-credit
Position the protocol for long-term success

Along the way, we may encounter hiccups, the strength of our community makes us confident that TrueFi will become one of the largest protocols in DeFi. Together, we’re going to win uncollateralized lending.
At present, our internal tasks include:

Improving the app.truefi.io user interface
Improving TrueFi documentation so that you can get the most in-depth understanding of TrueFi and TRU
Bringing on more creditworthy borrowers
Bringing in more TUSD lenders
