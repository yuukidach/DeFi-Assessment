['Community Risk Level Consensus Check'],"
Simple Summary
Three distinct levels from which the community can select a preferred risk tolerance for the Compound ecosystem. The results of this survey will inform Gauntlet’s analysis to deliver Dynamic Risk Parameters to optimize yield, capital efficiency, and mitigate depositor losses.

Abstract
From a market risk perspective, the goal for Gauntlet’s simulations is to standardize Value-at-Risk (VaR) across all assets. Matching risk tolerance to a normalized expected yield throughout Compound ensures no subset of assets adds disproportionate risk to the protocol.
Following asset onboarding, empirical data on user behaviour (e.g., average health factors), and changes in market conditions (e.g., expected slippage) improve our simulation precision. Improved precision allows for higher confidence in model outputs—particulary for aggressive recommendations.
Gauging risk appetite is something Gauntlet will do quarterly to ensure our risk parameter recommendations track the preference of the Compound community.

Motivation
As expected and observed, liquidity risk, volatility risk, and market capitalization frequently change for all assets on Compound. Updating risk paramaters (including Collateral Factor, Close Factor, Borrow Cap, Reserve Factor, and Liquidation Incentive) to remain in lockstep with the market is key to improving the Gauntlet’s target metrics.

Specification
We would note that the below are subject to change by the time a vote goes up but should provide a good illustration of the delineation between risk categories.

Risk Level Detail
Conservative metrics: the models target a 5-10% decrease on each side of the capital efficiency (opportunity cost of capital) as well as risk metrics (some conflation of liquidations, insolvencies, and market impact) on each asset.
Moderate metrics: target a similar risk profile to the current risk parameters with reweightings to achieve improved capital efficiency.
Aggressive metrics: target a 5-10% increase for capital efficiency (opportunity cost of capital) with considerations for the same risk metrics (liquidations, insolvencies, and market impact) on each asset.

Key Model Inputs & Notes
We chose to include Collateral Factor to illustrate risk categories in this poll, as Collateral Factor is the parameter that has the most obvious and significant impact on Compound’s risk levels and capital efficiency. As a general note, we make efforts to update parameters on a single-batch basis (as opposed to updating several parameters for any given asset at the same time), which the Compound community has voiced as their preference. Gauntlet’s scope also covers Close Factor, Borrow Cap, Reserve Factor, and Liquidation Incentive, which are parameters that have more complex impacts. Global parameters such as Liquidation Incentive and Close Factor can have broader impacts on the Compound ecosystem. As such, we are continuing to work on validating such parameters through our simulations with updated liquidation economics.

As on-chain options and perpetual futures become more popular, it is important to acknowledge the various sources of liquidity available. The liquidators in our simulations mimic the behavior of liquidations observed on the Ethereum blockchain. Namely, many liquidators sell liquidated collateral in an atomic transaction on a decentralized exchange. For liquidations larger than 10,000 USD in size in the last 90 days, over 60% went through a Sushiswap, Uniswap V2, or Uniswap V3 pool within the liquidation transactions. The asset slippage calculations focus on spot market conditions. As market liquidity and behavior changes, we will adapt our simulations accordingly.

['Community Risk Level Consensus Check'],"Nice work Gauntlet.
Regarding conservative vs moderate vs aggressive: what are the differences between these? It is just a matter of capital efficiency and insolvencies? I am wondering if we can use your Value-at-risk stat to remove some of the guesswork. For example, conservative might be $0 VaR, moderate $10m, and aggressive $50m. I am just making those numbers up for the example.
In your table of CFs, some assets like COMP, for example, have the same CF in more than one column. Given the labeling, I would think each column would have a different number?
I voted for moderate, but I could be amendable to aggressive once I learn more about the differences between the two.",5,1.0,2021-10-18
['Compound Finance COMP rewards'],"Last Wednesday’s governance call brought attention to how the treasury’s COMP is being managed/spent. The original intention by Compound Labs was to distribute COMP tokens to users of the protocol and attract more users to the protocol. The protocol is currently rewarding 2252 COMP per day. That is worth roughly $900k. Most of the COMP rewarded to market participants ends up being sold. For example, Yearn Finance is has about $1B in assets that are being used to farm on Compound.
We need to find new ways to build the community and distribute the treasury’s massive COMP position in a way that directly benefits the protocol and its tokenholders. It has been over a year since the incentives began. I think it is time for the community to take a different tack.
Off the bat, I will say I am against burning COMP and doing an airdrop. I think a burn is the least efficient way to distribute funds because it does not attract new users. An airdrop to users who have historically used the protocol is better than burning but not much better, in my opinion.
Robert Leshner posted in the Discord, “my personal view is that any change should be methodical, not a huge step. And, any reduction, should be paired with new ways of distributing COMP to users to increase the community, grow the protocol, and improve the protocol.”
Below are a few ideas for the community to consider/debate. Please post which ideas you like/dislike.

Reward voters with one or more votes for each proposal they cast a vote. All types of votes would qualify for the reward. It would be some kind of pro-rata their voting power up to a limit, so people don’t just make a zillion wallets to participate in governance and so already large holders don’t receive outlandish rewards. Here is a link for how many COMP the top 100 voters would get if they voted. Feel free to copy the sheet and adjust the parameters. Very roughly speaking, I think we could see +250 new voters.
Separate supply and borrow side COMP rewards. This has already been brought up in the forums a couple of times. I think it is a great idea. Incentivizing borrowing doesn’t make a ton of sense, so shifting it towards the supply side would better distribute COMP and improve protocol liquidity.
Supersizing the grants program: Larry and I have been discussing what the grants program will do in September when the trial period ends. We think building out a full-time team (notice plural) to run the program and take a more active role in development would be awesome. We haven’t talked too much about what it will look like, but it likely follows what the Uniswap Grants program is doing. They have a three-person full-time team working and have been making some impressive headway. I won’t say much on this because we need to flush out a more comprehensive plan, but I will say we are looking for a full-time grants lead and others interested in working full-time on grants. DM Larry or me if you want to talk more about that.
We could start a program to help cover fees related to using Compound. Balancer did something like this where they covered ETH fees associated with trading. A long, long time ago, I did some research on this to see if we covered 80% of ETH fees associated with Compound functions what it would cost the protocol. I could revitalize some of that work if the community likes the idea.
We could distribute additional COMP rewards to users who also participated in governance. Balancer was the first protocol to start doing this and saw an immediate increase in governance participation. Users who were farming BAL that also participated in governance received extra BAL. We could implement a program that rewards farmers with an extra 2% (open to suggestions) if they vote in the latest completed governance proposal. I think this is a great idea to get users of the protocol also engaged in governance.

I want to note that ideas 1, 4, & 5 would likely be done off-chain. I could develop a script that analyzes activity (open-source) that generates a list of addresses and comp rewards. That list would be published on IPFS and be used for a merkle root drop similar to Balancer’s weekly claim or Sushi’s vesting program. We could do it weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly. To manage this, we would likely use the existing community multisig (or make a new one) to control the COMP and verify the IPFS data/claim. Here is a link to the Balancer site and repo.
Here is my rank of the above ideas (1 being best - 7 being worst):

Supersize the grants program
Separate compSpeed into supply & borrow.
Distribute additional COMP rewards to protocol users who also vote.
Compound protocol usage fee reimbursement.
Reward people for voting
Airdrop (bad idea)
Burn (worst idea)

Since I didn’t go into detail here, feel free to ask questions. I think I will make a poll a week from today after people have had a chance to ask questions, so we can try to gain a consensus on what people like. If we can reach a consensus, @elee and I can develop it (although we’re getting pretty busy), or I would be happy to work with the community or hand it off altogether to someone.",105,836.0,2021-08-02

This might be more involved than what you are envisioning, but it may be worth looking into SourceCred. I know Maker utilizes them to reward governance and forum participation programmatically on a weekly basis.
Regardless, I agree with your overall statement in that we should be weighting COMP rewards more heavily to those who are actively participating in the community rather than those farming via Yearn who sell it instantly on the market.

['Compound Finance COMP rewards'],"Thanks Getty! I’d like to share my .02 DAI
TL;DR: the protocol’s current incentives are structured around incentivizing capital, not users. This has been the logical approach to bootstrapping liquidity in the first year of decentralized governance, but I agree with Getty that the protocol would be better served to begin realigning incentives so that some fraction of them are more squarely targeted at the engagement of users.
…I hear the counterargument that splitting capital across a number of wallets (so-called Sybil attack) makes any distinction between capital and users impossible. I have stated before and continue to argue that Sybil attacks on user-focused incentivization strategies can be made unprofitable by logarithmic distribution of incentives (e.g. +0.1 COMP per factor of 10 in whichever metric the incentive is based on) as long as gas costs are finite and measurable.
I am marginally supportive of idea 1 (paying active voters with COMP) as a temporary measure, ideally decaying in size over time, because the potential engagement upside is worth it. If even a small fraction of users who earned COMP through Coinbase Earn participated in governance (could even be integrated with Coinbase Earn as a follow-up tutorial), it would be a major win for engagement and a significant return for those users under the formula @Getty proposes. As stated in my TL;DR, I would argue for a logarithmic distribution (or a piece-wise step-function distribution approximating it). I would still support @Getty’s distribution if the community prefers it. Importantly, I would not support a distribution model in direct proportion to COMP holdings: that goes back to incentivizing capital over users.
I’m excited that there is already a PR for idea 2 (split borrow/supply streams for COMP rewards) by @arr00 and @TylerEther. I hope this will be proposed and adopted as soon as due diligence is completed. It’s my second-favorite idea of the bunch.
Idea 3 (expanding the Grants program) is my favorite: it does more to serve the protocol and tokenholders than the other ideas while incentivizing the best kind of user engagement: converting users into developers, program managers, community evangelists, what-have-you, all roles that help build the community alongside the protocol. While I am a recent beneficiary of the program, I don’t anticipate applying for another grant any time soon because of time constraints; I think that reduces any conflict of interest I might have in encouraging expansion of Compound Grants.
I support Idea 4 (partial reimbursement of costs to interact with the protocol): it values users over capital and makes a huge difference for smaller participants. It’s my impression that the perspectives of small users are massively under-represented in these sorts of governance discussions. From a small user perspective, even a partial gas reimbursement is a major user incentive and would make a huge difference, especially with engagement in governance (yes, there is comp.vote, though it is still a bit hard to discover for new users).
I am opposed to Idea 5 because the reward structure incentivizes capital over users, which is what I’m arguing we should be trying to push beyond. If I borrow $1M of assets on Compound and my friend borrows $1K of assets, I should not be rewarded 1000x the amount of bonus COMP rewarded to my friend for the same action/effort/cost. I would be more supportive of this idea if it were recast as a gas reimbursement for voting with rewards disbursed relative to ETH spent to vote (not relative to amount of COMP farmed).
Many of the largest COMP holders appear to be opposed to Idea 6 (airdrop to early users). Going back to my main argument that the protocol should seek strategies to incentivize users, not just capital, I think folks are underappreciating how powerful of a community-building opportunity we have before us to start the process of incentivizing real users with an acknowledgment of the protocol’s earliest adopters. These are our evangelists and educators, the folks who can share their experiences with the protocol with their friends, the folks who will actually bother to write letters to their legislators when a bill misunderstands what smart contracts are or what decentralization means. The protocol doesn’t owe them anything, but that doesn’t mean it’s not in the protocol’s best interest to afford them a meaningful opportunity to engage in governance that doesn’t require them to market buy (like many of them probably have) while whales quickly farmed enough COMP to sell to them or submit a CAP.
We can incentivize current and future users to do the things that we want them to do by spending COMP now to reward them for those behaviors; but when the incentives run dry, typically so do the incentivized activities. Loyalty is a scarce resource in DeFi, though fortunately Compound’s “lego” has gained the loyalty of many DAOs whose protocols rely on Compound under the hood.  Still, there’s no cohort on the scale of 10K people we can count on more to do the things we can’t incentivize in a targeted way, or to carry on with those things beyond the available runway of COMP incentives, than the protocol’s earliest users.",79,255.8,2021-08-03
['Compound Finance COMP rewards'],"A great thread @getty.
I’d like to suggest taking decisions that support users that hold small amounts of COMP. It’s users that form a community and that spread the word. Also, a small COMP holder today, might be a big supporter in the future…
Here are some concrete suggestions to complement what has been said and suggested above:

Enable to vote for for free when using Coinbase wallet.
(Unfortunately this isn’t possible yet through https://comp.vote/ )
Enable a cheap withdrawal/transfer of COMP from the compound app to the wallet.
(At the moment it’s simply not economical to use the official claim COMP function. Without COMP in the wallets there is no way to vote/to get engaged, if I am not mistaken.)
Shifting COMP rewards to the supply side.
(To attract more users that wil then learn more about Compound and the community.)

['Compound Finance COMP rewards'],@allthecolors well said.,63,12.6,2021-08-03
['Compound Finance COMP rewards'],"I really like the goals that @getty , @allthecolors and others have laid out.
Broad goals:

Incentivize participation in governance and voting
Incentivize new users over new capital.

I’d like to lay out two more broad goals that are worthy of COMP distribution:
3) Maximize protocol revenue even at the expense of TVL (the Uni-V3 strategem)
Losing the recursive farming TVL on collateral assets is not a big loss as it doesn’t add much to net liquidity. COMP farming TVL was arguably more important when TVL was what made a protocol viable, but those days are long gone. Revenue is more important. So eliminating the 50/50 reward is a big step towards more efficient use of COMP. It will also reduce selling pressure from pure farming strategies.

Support and expand the protocol (especially V3 - Gateway)

Incentivizing use of V3/Gateway is critical for making Compound a key protocol for every single smart contract chain. We’ve seen the huge opportunities that arose on BSC, Polygon, and Solana & should work hard to cement Gateway as THE key liquidity provider and bridge between chains. So, incentivizing supply on Gateway is critical, and to a lesser extent incentivizing borrowing.
Borrowing is already very lucrative to those who are sophisticated enough to do it. Borrowing stables enables long positions and yield farming. On the volatile side, shorting alone is a massive incentive; it allows massive optionality that hasn’t been fully realized by retail users.
Shorting lets you delta hedge, which could cover a large % of your ETH or BTC holdings and insulate your borrows during market crashes. This is arguably more important than making money with naked shorts.
The major gap on the borrow side is sophistication of users and usability of tools. Things like Instadapp fill a need in that regard. The space has the potential to evolve beyond interest rate arbitrage and yield farming. This is where the grant program can step in big-time! Grants should be supporting projects not only on the lending side but also targeted towards borrowers.
There could be small projects targeted towards making borrowing from Compound more convenient (better UX), widespread (e.g. credit cards or payday loans type deal), or more tightly integrated into swap platforms (e.g. like Impermax on a bigger scale and multichain)",62,42.4,2021-08-04
['Compound Finance COMP rewards'],"shoutout to @getty and @allthecolors for caring.
If you take a look at who are the biggest market participants, you get Yearn, Instadapp accounts, and some other friends who like to hang out in the HF (1.00-1.05) range.   Yes, they stabilize rates, yes, dumping COMP is kosher, its a free market, but is this the way to run a business?
I mean compound isn’t a business, its a bunch of bytecode and magic internet money, so there’s no precedence. That’s why we must create precedence. Compound was the first to liquidity mine in money markets, and became a large portion of the money markets because its giving away 10 times as much as it makes, kind of.
Ether we act like a bank and figure out our balance sheet prospectus, start compiling by Basel 3/4
(We mostly are, our reserve ratio is above 7% on average and who knows about Tier 1 and Tier 2 equity) or, we act like a business and stop giving equity away for no reason. Around 30% of emitted daily is dumped on on chain, which is fine, but it should be addressed. I think a slp/LP/BLP COMP/ETH token as collateral would help align incentives in that regard.
But honestly, cut 100% of COMP distribution, we need a clean slate to help gateway and other bridges, lets stop giving away over 600 COMP a day to Yearn, and I don’t know, give it to ourselves?

['Compound Finance COMP rewards'],"This topic is okay. I like 2, 3 (if there is any way to make it non-gameable), 5 is the same as 3 basically and I do like the Airdrop idea if it can be done in a way where users can only claim it if they continue to use the protocol & we have it to where zero COMP will be essentially burned due to non-accessible accounts.
With that said, I’m with @massnomis for turning this protocol into a business (or at least a self-sustaining protocol that will always have a COMP balance in which can be used for stuff, like for paying @getty and @allthecolors). Just think, if Compound runs out of COMP, what does this forum look like?
I see there being an unlimited (sort of) supply of COMP that can help with distributing the COMP rewards to suppliers/borrowers. The COMP earning rewards on the borrow side of the COMP market could actually be used as a stream of income for continuing rewarding Compound users.
Everyone’s first take at this market (me included) see the borrow cap or the distribution of COMP rewards as something we need to stop immediately. However, looking at it from a POV where it was Compound Governance in control of the Borrowed COMP, it kind of makes sense as a revenue stream.
I say that Compound should depreciate the current COMP market and create a new one where our community adjusts the amount of COMP borrowed to maximize COMP rewards / incentivize COMP suppliers. This could be a non-collateralized debt position which would be secured by the Compound Treasury. Not only could this keep the COMP rewards going longer (forever), but also could implement something like a quarterly vote to where the community chooses a proposal to back with the borrowed COMP.",52,80.4,2021-08-05
['Compound Finance COMP rewards'],"Fantastic ideas @getty !
I very much support idea 3 - supersizing the grants department. We could do a trial run of a decentralized grants department and have it overseen by a few key individuals. That way, we can collectively generate the best ideas to grow Compound and even further, the DeFi ecosystem.
I’m against incentivizing people to participate in governance. We don’t want ill-informed voters and/or people simply voting with the herd. Rather, I think we should push to get people to delegate their votes to active governance members - the people who know the protocol the most and have skin in the game. We could reward these delegates for the governance work they’re doing.
In talking to friends, the #1 reason why they aren’t using DeFi and why I don’t really encourage them to use it is because of gas fees. Gas fees are acceptable for those with $10k+ in crypto, but it’s hard to justify paying $20+ to deposit when they’re only playing with a few hundred dollars. So I’m all for gas fee reimbursements and hope that doing so creates [more] precedence for other protocols to do the same.
We could even do more in regards to gas fees… possibly enable minting/borrowing/redeeming/repaying by signature? Then have Compound Labs batch execute these events? Off-topic though.",48,59.6,2021-08-06
['Compound Finance COMP rewards'],"Gas improvements are coming. Decentralized, open-source batch smart contract. Along with other gas improvements which are rewarded through RFPs. I don’t like the idea of spending more on gas fees. When DeFi goes mainstream, gas fees will be the least of our worries.",49,54.8,2021-08-06
['Compound Finance COMP rewards'],"That’s interestin discussion overall, as indeed COMP distributions have a lot of things to improve. I see kind of a lot of focus on rewarding voters, that in some way mentioned both in 1 and 5 ideas, so i want to start with that.
Let’s say it straight: amount of voters is really massively irrelevant. It really doesn’t matter if people vote or not and especially very small, “dust amount” holders. They have absolutely zero impact on outcome, and in general, holders of single-digit comp should rather be delegating than voting themselves. Voting power is what matters, not amount of voters. Voting power is concentrated in very few accounts. How and if they vote DO matter, remaining 10-20% (that isn’t exact number) of voting power spreaded across hundreds of adresses does not. That’s the facts. Participation doesn’t really matter and that goes directly from distribution of voting power and thus anything spend on incentivising useless action is wasted money. Who we going to fool here with massive participation when every single decision can be made regardless of participation of masses.
However, i fully support everybody who want to execute their voting power. Either by directly casting a vote, or by delegating their voting power to their representative. That’s their right.
But i’m really curious: Does nobody really thought why participation isn’t that massive? Aside of people just thinking that their vote matters not?
The problem here isn’t because people are so ignorant. It’s just COMP token design itself is so bad and outdated. It kind of based on assumption that COMP token is valueless governance token, which primarily would be held in wallet. And that kind of
assumption never worked from the very beginning. As soon as it hit AMM and become paired to assets which have value, it gained value as well, regardless of initial vision.
So right now COMP is financial asset, which do have a value which also “kind of” could be used in governance.
The problem here is that there are 2 basic real life usecases for that type of financial assets:


It can be used as collateral


It can be used for LP at AMM DEXes like usiswap, sushiswap, etc.


And interesting enough if you try to use it in any of this ways, you are instantly unable to participate in governance by design. Because in both cases you can’t keep token in wallet. And thus it instantly looses it’s utility in governance.
Fortunately Compound is Lending platform by itself, so Collateral usecase is relatively easy to solve with already pretty much existing code. And here we come to COMP staking. What is COMP staking? Well, in our case, it’s basically just a Compound
market with only Supply side present. But it wouldn’t earn any interest, you’ll tell me. Yea, and it’s not supposed to. But it will earn COMP distribution. And it will give that distribution for those who hold COMP. And that is, a way to
improve COMP distribution. AND because same address hold the same amount of cCOMP, it’s theoretically possible for COMP staker to participate in governance still.
And of course, we should never forget that existing COMP market is a SHAME and DISGRACE of all DeFi. Example of market manipulation via artifitially setting CAP and rewarding select portion of users for months, at the expense of everybody else.
Every single person holding more than 65k COMP should feel personally responsible in that mismanagement. Because they actually are, by being aware, having power to create a proposal to fix that and yet taking no action. And if regulation eventually comes to crypto, that would be example of inability of DAO to properly self-regulate. Because, they would say look, they created special privileged group of users, who are earning extra rewards. And that isn’t a market condition, it’s a manipulation.
It’s worth reminding that the problem is still there: COMP market, as it is now is NOT fine.
But let’s go back on topic of improving COMP distribution. It could be somewhat fixed for users who LP COMP in v2 type of AMM. It’s a bit more complicated because of oracle for LP tokens, but it can be done in same way as COMP staking, as a one-
sided Compound market for LP tokens. Voting portion is more complicated as amount of COMP in LP varies, maybe somebody could find technical solution for that. But so far aside of Snapshoting i don’t see anybody made a way to give LP voting power.
Creating such tools not only improve distribution itself: Part of COMP distribution could be diverted to COMP staking and to LP staking. But that also will improve liquidity. Users, who provide liquidity for COMP tokens in various DEXes, are in some
way doing more for protocol, then users just supplying or borrowing funds to Compound.
And actually big portion of users will be able to actually execute voting powers which they DO already have, but actually unable to use, because it have financial costs to actually pull their tokens either from collateral, or from LP to wallet to participate.
Not like i’m strongly against rewarding voters, even though i believe it’s useless spending of COMP. But unless things mentioned above are solved, yeah, i might pull 1 COMP or whatever minimum needed to get distribution and do signing. But i’d
surely not going to pull all tokens from where it makes financial reason for me to keep to just cast a vote, which wouldn’t change anything. (Yeah, as a very long time user, i do hold some very minor voting power, and yes, i pretty much never participate for the reasons i outlined. I’m aware of proposals and could be voting still, if technical options would exist even without any specific rewards for doing so)
I want to shortly mention airdrop. It’s not really that much bad idea. And it doesn’t need to be 200m airdrop. It’s just dragged for so very long time while it should be closed long ago. There is nothing really to discuss, basically only founders and early investors have the voting power to pass it or not. They should just voted on that long ago instead of collecting opinions from those whose opinion doesn’t matter in decision making. Idea itself isn’t that bad, yes. It indeed somewhat improve distribution, because right now COMP isn’t really going to users pretty much at all. It goes to big capital in vast
majority, not to the broad community: small users are diluted by massive capital.
As for expanding grants and separating supply and borrow markets for rewards being able to be fine tuned, it’s both great ideas, enough was said on those and i very much agree with support of that, voiced by others.",53,55.6,2021-08-06
['Compound Finance COMP rewards'],"I address only 1.
Depending on how it’s done, rewarding people for voting could be a lite version of raiding the treasury:

Whoever votes ‘yes’ on this proposal will split the treasury with me in proportion to voting power.

Compare it to:

Those who vote will receive funds from the treasury in proportion to voting power.

To avoid abuse, I see two problems to solve.

Sybil attacks - create many wallets to vote and receive a flat Comp reward.
Whales draining the treasury at the expense of small holders through a scaling Comp reward.

To address these, Getty suggests a scaling reward up to a limit. (@allthecolors suggests logarithmic scaling, but I address linear.)
This limits 1. because the reward scales up to a point (say 10,000 votes). Basically empty wallets cannot game the system.
This tries to limit 2. to some debatable level. However, this fails to protect against Sybil attacks by any user able to command greater than 10,000 votes during the duration of the program. A user able to command 40,000 votes could split the COMP between multiple wallets during the voting rewards program. Maybe current large COMP holders would be honorable and not Sybil, but there are people who might buy a lot of COMP to farm voting rewards.
How many COMP would someone have to hold to get 10,000 votes in during a duration?
What would they do to artificially increase this number? Make lots of pointless proposals to vote on?
What limits this? If there are 10,000 proposals to vote on today, someone with 1 COMP could receive the maximum reward by voting 10,000 times today.
Is the goal more people thinking about governance?
If so, another way of doing that might be COMP rewards from the grants program to people contributing thoughtful comments on comp.xyz.
If ‘more people thinking about governance’ is not the goal, what is? And why?",51,10.2,2021-08-06
['Compound Finance COMP rewards'],"This is a great list, and is sure to start a well-needed discussion in the community.
The highest priority, IMO, should be the optimization of the 2,312 /day distributed to each market, since small changes can have huge rampifications for how COMP is distributed, held, and used, and this currently represents almost the entirety of the distribution.
This is achieved by:


Separating the compSpeed into separate supply & borrow incentives, work which is almost complete (any / all additional eyes, and auditing welcome; as a community we should bring this work to the finish line)
Modifying the COMP distribution in ways which put more tokens into the hands of users; this likely means tying COMP more directly to “natural” use-cases, and less to “farmed” use-cases; collateral assets having COMP rewards only on the supply-side, and borrowing assets (stablecoins) configured with reserveFactors to make “folding” the asset un-economical (no “negative spreads”), but attractive to normal use. If done correctly, more COMP can get into the hands of users looking to participate in governance.

In terms of additional approaches / programs, as a guiding principle:



 getty:

Robert Leshner posted in the Discord, “my personal view is that any change should be methodical, not a huge step. And, any reduction, should be paired with new ways of distributing COMP to users to increase the community, grow the protocol, and improve the protocol.”


Expanding the grants team to encompass a full-time team has large upside–to encourage, and coordinate improvements to the protocol that are sustainable (long-term). Protocol improvements – whether on market selection, parameter selection, rate models, new features, and integrations are all results that compound. This is a great direction to explore, especially with the benefit of hindsight after months of operating the grants committee.
Another direction that the community can look, would be increasing the reserves of the protocol directly; figuring out a way to reward users that directly add reserves to the protocol, in markets that have the lowest ratios of reserves:borrowing. This is an alternative to providing COMP to farming users, while capturing most of the value for the protocol (and all users). This could increase safety & liquidity, while testing a new distribution model. It could be tied to vesting, etc.
Rewards for voting on proposals are interesting, but could create perverse behavior (e.g. making hundreds of “dummy” proposals, simply to capture more COMP). If this path is explored, it should be a set quantity of COMP per month, regardless of how many proposals there are, multiplied by participation rate. Now that there is an “abstain” option, it could bring participation close to 100%. This could even include a “quadratic” type reward, where smaller addresses earn a larger relative reward.",51,10.2,2021-08-09
['Implement cToken sweepToken and return accidentally sent funds'],"Two months ago, a significant amount of cUNI was accidentally sent to the cUNI contract in this transaction. While it is quite common for accidents to occur within DeFi, I believe that as a community, we should try to return accidentally sent funds when possible and establish a policy regarding it. This proposal acts to do so.
I propose a process as follows:

Create a proposal at most once every 6 months to return accidentally sent funds.
Impose a 10% penalty on the sent funds.
Only return funds to the address they were sent from.
Require  the sender to reply below this post requesting their funds back along with a signed signature or on-chain transaction with call data verifying their identity.
A minimum value of $1,000 at the time of the post.
Post by the sender must be made within 6 months of the accidental send. After this timeframe, the funds will be considered community assets.

Technical
I have added a function sweepToken(address token) to the CErc20 smart contract. This will send the entire balance of any token other than the underlying to the admin (Timelock). It is callable by anyone allowing for future proposals returning user funds to be a simple as possible (the funds will already be in the Timelock).
I have also commented out unused verify hooks for gas savings.
The changes implemented here are very straightforward and limited in scope so I don’t believe a formal audit is required. The new feature is extensively tested through scenario testing and the proposal has been simulated through fork simulations. The code has already been reviewed by many community members, and hopefully more will review it in the coming days. View the changes in the PR.
Proposal
The proposal will contain the following calls:

Update the cUNI implementation to the implementation here

sweep cUNI out of the cUNI contract into the Timelock
Transfer 90% of the cUNI to the sender: 0xf22c2e3475e4a066f4e9f44567c950dd36112d05

['Should Compound Retroactively Airdrop Tokens to Early Users?'],"The Story So Far
Crypto has always been about building networks that are owned and operated by their respective communities. For example, when Compound launched the COMP governance token in April of this year, the goal was to place control of the Compound protocol in the hands of a broad, representative, and actively engaged community of users and developers that have a stake in Compound’s success. After all, that’s what decentralization means.
While the COMP token launch has brought new users onto the platform, most of those users to date have been professional liquidity providers (e.g., crypto hedge funds, whales, and prop shops). This has been good for Compound because, as a money market, it needs liquidity to function.
The Problem
The problem is that protocols like Compound need more than just liquidity to succeed. They need developers who work on things like protocol upgrades and on integrations with the outside world (i.e. wallets, exchanges, dapps, other protocols, etc); they also need a set of long-term power users who take an interest and step up to participate in protocol governance.
An Idea for Discussion
Compound owes much of its success to the thousands of community members that have joined its journey over the past two years. This is true particularly of the early users who provided liquidity (both as borrowers and lenders) before there was any monetary incentive to do so and of the early developers who opted for building on top of Compound before the launch of the COMP token.
If there is any group of people that is most likely to be aligned with Compound’s long term success, it’s that group. As Compound’s early adopters, they are the ones who are the most likely to become enduring superfans of the network; they are the ones who stand to be the best stewards of the protocol’s long-term direction.
Concretely, the community can opt through governance to redirect 5% the total COMP supply to the ~5,000 addresses that belong to both users and developers who interacted with the Compound protocol (either v1 or v2) before June 8, 2020 — i.e. one week before the launch of the COMP token. To help ensure that the recipients of these grants remain aligned with the community in long term, these tokens would be distributed to those addresses gradually, over the course of four years.
The above would imply that each of the ~5,000 early adopters of the Compound protocol would receive 100 COMP tokens over the course of four years. At today’s prices, that implies a grant of $12.35k worth of COMP per address each year. As for where these tokens would come from: they would be redirected from the flow that currently goes to liquidity providers.
We would love feedback from the community on this idea.

['Should Compound Retroactively Airdrop Tokens to Early Users?'],"I believe retroactive airdrop of COMP tokens to users is in general good idea. It makes sense to give some voice to those, who used protocol before launch of governance token.
Why i think so? Because at the current point, vast majority of governance tokens are distributed to liquidity farmers. Which, while are indeed providing some benefet for protocol, doesn’t really justify why they actually should capture almost all governance power eventually (if things will go same way for 4 years). While retroactive airdrop doesn’t completely resolve that issue, it will indeed add to decentralization and will reward some actual users of protocol, not those who just put capital on both sides of DAI market with sole intention to milk governance tokens.
While i think most of community will support the idea of distribution the details are worth discussing:
First, what is reasoning behind 5% of Supply? Why not 3%? Or maybe 10%? Especially considering vesting period.
Second, should it be socialism distribution, or meritocracy? Like should users recieve equal amount, regardless of their usage, or should it depend on for example how many fees they generated? Or maybe should it be a combination of those, like base amount of COMP per address + additional COMP, based on usage for that address (fees accrued on both supply and borrow side). I personally would rather not see pure socialism, though to distribute at least some portion of COMP based on if address ever interacted with Compound seems reasonable and responsible towards community.
Add: Another thing to keep in mind, that unlike UNI tokens, COMP tokens do not replenish, they have fixed supply, and thus, with doing retroactive airdrops we don’t want them to be lost by being distributed to “dead” addresses, which user lost keys to or forgot about them, so i think distribution should have some sort of “Claim” interaction, where tokens, which were never claimed going back to distribution pool after some reasonable time, a year maybe. Like if user never claimed them within a year, account is considered abandoned, and tokens reserved for that account released back to pool with account loosing their right to claim them.",232,191.4,2020-11-23

Since COMP distribution started I’ve held everything I’ve received. I’ve also done some market buys to increase my COMP. Despite this, I still don’t have enough COMP to create an autonomas proposal (100 COMP). I do find this discouraging.
I think the idea of getting early participants up to 100 COMP is a good one. Specifically because that is the threshold to meaningfully participate in governance.
In terms of distributing this, I would probably favor some sort of larger up-front airdrop with a slower distribution of the remainder.

['Should Compound Retroactively Airdrop Tokens to Early Users?'],"I am generally neutral regarding this proposal. However, I would like to remind everyone about the whole Uniswap debacles where some users did not receive their share due to the use of contracts account. If we want to be fair, let’s discuss it here first about who (addresses) get it and who does not.
Some projects, with users who directly use compound, that we might need to consider:

InstaDapp
Dharma
Argent
please add more…

I believe there are also other projects that use compound in parts of their protocol, where users  indirectly interacted with compound, such as PoolTogether. We should discuss where the lines would be drawn. I suggest two-tier approach to this problem.

Proposal 1: Determine the (max) amount of comp that the community wants to reward compound users with. e.g. 5% of treasury or 2% of total comp supply or 100 comp per address. Only after proposal 1 has passed, we then proceed with the next proposal.

Proposal 2: Determine which users will receive the airdrop.

This way, we can be sure of what the community really decides on and avoid scenarios like:

I agree with comp airdrop but x amount is too much/little so I vote NO.
I agree with comp airdrop and x amount, but I disagree that y project users also receive it so I vote NO.

If this proposal indeed goes through the motion: I personally support the cutoff date of Jun 8th 2020, vesting schedule and minimum airdrop of 100 comp per user (considering that’s what you need to create an auto-proposal). I also like @Sirokko’s ideas on mechanism to distribute comp to active addresses, in the hope that those who receive airdrop will be active contributor to the protocol. One potential mechanism is deciding pre-determined “Claim Window”, such as “After 1 year of no-claim, the comp allocated to the addresses will be returned back to treasury”.

If this does turn out to pass, would recommend holding off until we have vesting implemented.",142,63.4,2020-11-24
['Should Compound Retroactively Airdrop Tokens to Early Users?'],"Agree that voter apathy/splits might be an issue but it is also entirely obvious that will be a problem regardless of the existence of this specific proposal. I also agree that grants for new and future contributors would be net good for compound. However, I disagree with the characterization of this proposal as “acquisition” cost, since the users have already been acquired. This proposal, I believe, aims at realigning those who have provided important signal of early adoption for the protocol.



 Praneeth:

If this does turn out to pass, would recommend holding off until we have vesting implemented.


I think most people here agree with implementing vesting schedule for the airdrop (IF it goes through). I am not sure what you mean by “vesting implemented”. Do you mean comp vesting for liquidity mining rewards? I don’t see how that these two are related. The source of this airdrop would be allocated directly from the treasury. Hence, the community can decide to distribute the airdrop separate from the current rewards logic.
After some considerations I’m in favor of this proposal now. It will take some time but I believe this will be net positive for compound. Sure, giving incentives to present and future contributors is important (with potential gamification) but not sure if it’s actually any more positive than incentives for past contributions. Also, vesting it in up to four years actually might make the recipients to actively contribute to the protocol for that period, ensuring active compound community for these early years. More importantly, those recipients use compound before any liquidity incentives (that disproportionately benefit whale LPs and short term users i.e. mercenary farmers).
I would bet that these early adopters will actually be more active in the development of compound than the mercenary farmers. One last point, 100 comp for 1000s of actors is a great incentive for a diverse community to emerge from while decreasing the impact of any potential plutocracy.",159,186.8,2020-11-24
['Should Compound Retroactively Airdrop Tokens to Early Users?'],"I would go even more drastic about retroactive rewards,
compound v1 started around Sep-26-2018 and COMP distribution started at Jun-15-2020 that means that early users used Compound for at least 2,5 year.
if we would want to be totally fair and give equal rewards for the users before COMP distribution started then 30.7%~ from the total amount that the Reservior received to distribute should go to them, but also i would love to include some calculation about protocol usage to calculate what amount should receives individually.",138,167.6,2020-11-24
['Should Compound Retroactively Airdrop Tokens to Early Users?'],"Agreed.  Been a user since 2018.  Proper precedent to set in my estimation.  These folks, a small sliver, whom have chimed in above have been users who were incredibly valuable to its operation.  Ought to matter to current users and funds who liquidity provide.
Math is simple on this one.",136,82.2,2020-11-24
['Should Compound Retroactively Airdrop Tokens to Early Users?'],"According to the problem statement:
“The problem is that protocols like Compound need more than just liquidity to succeed. They need developers who work on things like protocol upgrades and on integrations with the outside world (i.e. wallets, exchanges, dapps, other protocols, etc); they also need a set of long-term power users who take an interest and step up to participate in protocol governance.” I think there are two separate issues that the author outlines:

reward early users of Compound (borrowers and lenders) and
reward early developers who built on Compound in the early days when DeFi was not even a thing.

I personally contributed to Compound in both capacities: was an early user of liquidity pools and the first team who built a third party dapp on Compound – Bloqboard (now we are a mobile wallet Linen.app and are solely powered by Compound). Several other teams built on Compound back in 2018 and 2019: Zerion, InstaDapp, DeFi Pulse/LoanScan integrated analytics, Argent, Dharma. I am pretty sure there were more. All these teams helped the protocol to get exposure in the early days. Back in 2018 and 2019 it was unclear what use cases can be entertained and who borrowers and lenders were. In 2018 only few VCs understood DeFi - it was that early.
To my knowledge none of the users and developers were recognized for contributing resources and building on top. I do not even own a single COMP and can not vote. So, I strongly believe that it is fair to consider airdropping tokens to both of these groups: early users and early developers. Amount of the airdrop for users and developers are up for the community to decide. Probably makes sense to discuss these two groups of contributors separately.",166,243.2,2020-11-25
['Should Compound Retroactively Airdrop Tokens to Early Users?'],"Hello, I’m allo, active in the Uniswap governance forum ; Compound user since 2019.
I support the airdrop, but I would like to also encourage you to initially include addresses who interacted with the protocol through smartcontract wallets like Argent, Dharma, etc.
Or at the very least, have this debate before the airdrop. Otherwise, it may cause unnecessary drama and waste precious governance time.",162,117.4,2020-11-25
['Should Compound Retroactively Airdrop Tokens to Early Users?'],"I have a lot to say on this topic. Hope I’ll get around to writing up something soon.
TLDR (TLDW?) for now: I think it’s important to recognize the reason we as a community will be gifting people COMP and we should focus on advancing the protocol/community. The idea that Compound owes past users doesn’t sit well for me.",160,157.0,2020-11-26
['Should Compound Retroactively Airdrop Tokens to Early Users?'],"I agree that the way to move forward is to think about the future of the protocol. Compound does not owe anyone for its success other than its community of founders, developers, and other contributors.
The reason I think this idea is net good for compound is because I believe that we will have a better chance at having a more active community by rewarding past contributions vs designing a new mechanism that could be gamified and will definitely cost more.",138,107.6,2020-11-26

Analysis of Proposal 64
On October 1, Tyler L. created Proposal 64, an upgrade to the Compound Comptroller which patches the bug introduced in Proposal 62, which separated COMP distribution speeds between suppliers and borrowers and contained an unintentional bug. This new proposal a) patches the bug, preventing new users from being granted excessive COMP rewards, and b) locks COMP reward transfers for users who may have been affected by the bug. Further analysis is below on the means of the fix and which accounts will be prevented from COMP reward withdrawals.
Note: there will need to be another patch, after Proposal 64, to fully fix the issue and allow the rest of the accounts to continue standard accrual and transfers of COMP rewards. In the best case scenario, all accounts should continue to receive all rewards, past, present and future if some future (yet unbuilt) proposal is correctly applied.
Note: this patch (nor any other) has suggested recovering excess COMP that was given out to accounts. Instead, it aims to fix the accounting and return to proper accruals.

Effects of Proposal
Proposal 64 includes two adjustments to the Compound Comptroller functionality.
First, it changes line 1217 of distributeSupplierComp as follows:
- if (supplierIndex == 0 && supplyIndex > compInitialIndex) {
+ if (supplierIndex == 0 && supplyIndex >= compInitialIndex) {

and line 1256 of distributeBorrowerComp similarly:
- if (borrowerIndex == 0 && borrowIndex > compInitialIndex) {
+ if (borrowerIndex == 0 && borrowIndex >= compInitialIndex) {

Each missing equality check above excludes an entire set of uninitialized accounts from the conditional body. This in turn prevents those accounts from becoming initialized, since they incorrectly accrue COMP from an under-initialized position.
These changes prevent the bug from occuring for future users. Specifically: any account that would have been given excess COMP per the issue identified from Proposal 62, after this patch takes effect, will not be given excess COMP when later claiming COMP (or interacting with an affected market). Note: this does not undo the excess COMP that was accrued or distributed to accounts before this patch takes effect. Overall, this patch should return the Comptroller system to its normal path, except there are several accounts that did trigger the bug that will need to be properly accounted for before they can safely withdraw any future COMP rewards.
Thus, secondly, this patch includes the following patch in the beginning of grantCompInternal on line 1350:
+ for (uint i = 0; i < allMarkets.length; ++i) {
+   address market = address(allMarkets[i]);
+
+   bool noOriginalSpeed = compBorrowSpeeds[market] == 0;
+   bool invalidSupply = noOriginalSpeed && compSupplierIndex[market][user] > 0;
+   bool invalidBorrow = noOriginalSpeed && compBorrowerIndex[market][user] > 0;
+
+   if (invalidSupply || invalidBorrow) {
+     return amount;
+   }
+ }

The accounts that tripped the bug would have been given a non-zero index in the markets which did not have COMP rewards associated with them. For users that did not trip the bug, they would have and retain a zero index in such markets. Note: we use the old storage value to check if they had not been given a COMP speed. If this is true on either the supply or borrow side, we simply return with a no-op (that is: we do not transfer COMP and we return the COMP accrued is the same as the input value).
This snippet will, in effect, prevent an account which may have received excess COMP from claiming COMP from the protocol. It will not revert, but simply will not transfer out any COMP until a future patch that would ensure proper accounting for all such affected accounts.
Note: The check is overly broad and will prevent some users who have not actually hit the bug from claiming COMP as well – namely anyone who has interacted with a market which does not currently have a COMP (borrow) speed (cREP, cWBTC, cSAI, cAAVE, cYFI, cTUSD, cMKR, cSUSHI)
Note: In order for this patch to remain effective, no changes to COMP speeds should be made until claiming is unblocked for all users in the future patch.
The patch looks for accounts which may have been granted excess COMP, but it’s not obvious from the on-chain system if those accounts actually did since that would require knowing if those accounts previously had a supply or borrow balance, but that balance may have since changed. As such, there will need to be a follow-up patch to allow the rest of accounts in this category from withdrawing. This precaution will continue to affect new accounts that claim COMP from afflicted markets, even after Prop 64 is applied.

Review
From a variety of analyses, it does appear that the patch works as intended. That is: new accounts will no longer trip the bug, and some subset of accounts deemed definitely safe will be able to continue standard COMP claims. There has been work on creating scenarios and web3-forks that show the intended result. Additionally, even if there were accounts that were false-negatives from the transfer function, this would be no worse than the functionality that is present today. But it is likely that this patch does fix the bug and prevent any excess withdrawals.
The biggest downside of this patch is that it continues to effectively lock several accounts from honest COMP reward withdrawals, even if those accounts first interact with the affected markets after Prop 64 would go live. Thus, it will be required that a new patch be created soon afterwards to ensure that all accounts become unblocked. This patch is thus a temporary patch. That said, it is one that allows the protocol to return to normal for a large number of users.

Other Factors
As opposed to Prop 63, this patch should not negatively affect any protocol integrations. Specifically, the worst situation for an integration is that it does not receive the COMP rewards it believes it is expected to receive. This situation is no different than if the Comptroller did not have the COMP balance to complete the transfer and should have been assumed when building product integrations. As opposed to Prop 63, this patch does not revert for any user.
This patch has not been audited officially and should be reviewed thoroughly by the community. The intent of the patch is to do no harm, but the pros and cons of the change should be thoroughly reviewed before any community member makes a vote on this proposal.
Note: it is possible to pass and executed Proposal 63 and then Proposal 64. This should be evaluated a potential option, as well.

['Analysis of Proposal 64'],"Great analysis.
I’m about to start working on the code for proposal 65. Here’s what this future proposal will do:

Correct the accrued COMP amounts for the affected users
Remove the grantCompInternal changes to allow all users to be able to withdraw their accrued COMP

A key requirement before we can submit proposal 65 is for proposal 64 to be executed. We need it to be executed so that we can generate a definite list of affected users.
It is my intention to make proposal 65 as simple as possible to minimize the risk of adding additional bugs as well as restoring Compound to its fully working state as soon as possible.
Some members have talked about using merkel proofs as a way to fix the bad accrual amounts for affected users. While this would be a great feature to have, it would probably take a month or two of review and testing to ensure that it works well - far too long in my opinion to get Compound back on track.
So, therefore, it is my intention to use off-chain analysis to generate a list of users and the amounts they accrued incorrectly, and this list will be used in a one-off function to fix the bad accrual amounts. It’ll be up to the community to verify that this list is 100% correct and also to vote on passing it. Tools will be provided so that anyone can verify this list.

['Proposal 65: Correct Over-Accrued COMP'],"Thanks to @TylerEther for putting this proposal together.
a16z plans to vote yes on this proposal, as the changes being made here ensure that all users will be able to claim all correctly accrued COMP and that users who accrued excess COMP as a result of the 62 bug cannot claim that excess COMP. It fixes the root cause of the issues caused by Proposal 62 and gets Compound back to its fully functioning state and allows the protocol to move forward. We are fully supportive of this effort. Additionally, @alex_kroeger from our team put together a dune dashboard to review the data inputs being provided by Tyler’s script. You can find that dashboard here.
While we plan to vote yes, there are a few points about the proposal process that we would like to highlight. After Proposal 62 passed and the exploit was identified, we as a community had to move fast in order to stop the bleeding – it is completely reasonable to prioritize speed when funds are actively at risk, as they were in the case of proposals 63 and 64. However, after Proposal 64 was executed successfully, we had reached a point where funds in the Comptroller were no longer at risk of being drained.
Going forward, the community should aim to be more deliberate and systematic in our approach to reviewing code that affects contracts that hold a significant amount of funds. For example, for this current proposal, the community would have benefitted from having more time for review before the on-chain proposal was created. This would ensure sufficient time was given for audit/review, feedback, questions, and collaboration.
In the future, one way to implement this would be for the community to create and enforce a standard process for any new proposals that are introduced. It could look something like this:

Post in forums with links to the technical implementation for the community to review
Wait a minimum of a week from forum posting to pushing the proposal to an on-chain vote
During that week, the OP should:

Actively seek feedback from community members and adjust the proposal as needed
Join community calls to answer any questions on the proposal
Proactively seek other community members to review, audit, and test the implementation



Only after there has been sufficient time for people to review and feedback has been gathered, then it makes sense to move forward with the on-chain governance vote. There are likely other ways to implement this sort of thing, but in general a more rigorous process along these lines makes sense going forward. We encourage and welcome additional ideas from the community as we continue to iterate here.",29,248.8,2021-10-16
['Proposal 65: Correct Over-Accrued COMP'],"Gauntlet will ABSTAIN from Proposal 65.
Our first concern is that very few people seem to have reviewed it (at this point). The other concern is that the proposal is using an extra state variable to prevent it from being called twice. Given that only admin (governance) can call this function and it will be removed in the next proposal, it doesn’t seem like it is worth protecting. However, I do think this patch misses an obvious step to extract a bit more accrued COMP from each of the violating users. Basically, it looks at the compAccrued variable for each user and tries to extract as much as possible. If some of these users only claimed COMP say 2 weeks ago, we are missing all the COMP they have accrued since then.
Instead, I think we could call distributeSupplierComp and distributeBorrowerComp in this function to make sure compAccrued reflects an up-to-date calculation of accrued COMP. Alternatively, this could be done in a separate proposal but then I feel the use of the state variable for proposal65 is tricky as it claims to be “final”.
P.S. It’s worth mentioning that much more aggressive steps could be taken to seize the COMP from violating users, in particular, their collateral could be frozen or liquidating or their cTokens could be seized (not sure if this is possible). This would be much more complex and trust-breaking so not necessarily recommending but good to keep in mind.",23,37.6,2021-10-16
['Proposal 65: Correct Over-Accrued COMP'],"Thanks for the feedback, a16z and Gauntlet.
These changes were put together and proposed much quicker than most other proposals. While Compound is no longer at risk of losing additional COMP, the protocol is still not fully functional - users active in the affected markets are not able to withdraw their accrued COMP. If the protocol were fully functional, these changes certainly would have had a lot more public discussion before being submitted for a vote.
Getting Compound protocol to a fully functioning state with minimal downtime is my #1 priority. This partial downtime of COMP rewards can have negative effects on both users, other protocols, and developers. What if a user’s/protocol’s business logic relies on receiving the accrued COMP tokens and they’re unable to claim them?
We all know Compound’s governance is disorganized, and there are only a few busy individuals who are capable of seeing changes through all the way to proposal execution. It’d be terrible for this partial downtime to drag on for months due to this.",23,2.6,2021-10-16

Help the community understand our recommendations and methodology
Help the community understand how Gauntlet’s recommendations affect key risk metrics like VaR and Borrow Usage.

Some additional points around the dashboard

It will be updated daily, and any parameter recommendations will be pushed both to our dashboard as well as kicked off in forum discussion before going to a vote. We’ll try to streamline this process over time to get parameter updates to market faster.
The version we have in our mocks has been validated in user studies (which we are continuing to conduct with members of the Compound community) and serves as our initial MVP. We hope to launch this quickly and then iterate on key components with the community.

We have kicked off the development of the dashboard as of last week and are expecting to have it launched and live by Nov 9th . We have 6 people on our team working on this dashboard and the various data components that power it: @crypto_contrarian, @marcinja , @henryprior, @wfu , @shaan , @inkymaze.

['Formal process for new collateral assets'],"I encourage the Compound community to adopt a more formal process for adding new collateral assets. Each new asset adds existential risk to the entire protocol, yet in some cases the governance discussion has omitted important security questions.
Before creating a governance proposal (like #56) to add new collateral, at a minimum we should answer the following questions about the asset:

Who audited the collateral token contract? What security issues were raised in the collateral token’s audit reports? Are any of these relevant to its use as collateral in Compound?
Can the collateral token contract be upgraded? Who is authorized to make an upgrade? Can an upgrade happen instantly or is there a time-lock delay? Under what scenarios could an unauthorized upgrade occur? How many people or organizations would need to be compromised?
Does the collateral token contract have a fixed supply? If new tokens can be minted, are there any scenarios where tokens can be minted without proper authorization? (For example, centralized wrapped assets like WBTC and USDC may be vulnerable to insider collusion or external hackers.)
Are there any large token holders? Who are they and what security procedures protect their accounts? If a single holder owns enough of the token to use it as collateral to borrow a significant fraction of Compound assets, then a hacker who steals these tokens may be able to “sell” them on Compound by supplying them as collateral and “borrowing” clean assets. The existence of this exit ramp may in itself increase the incentive to hack such large wallets.
How much CEX and DEX liquidity exists for the collateral asset? This liquidity supports the liquidation process when the collateral asset is seized (and probably sold). Deep liquidity also defends against market price manipulation with the intent of triggering a cascading liquidation event.


For reference, recent examples of collateral discussion:

 pyggie:

Are there any large token holders? Who are they and what security procedures protect their accounts?


What is the threshold for ‘large’?
It seems relative to the asset’s liquidity.
If the asset has lots of slippage on DEXs, a hacker may use Compound to exit.
If hackers use Compound, the hack may not greatly impact the price of the underlying asset. If there’s enough liquidity across exchanges, liquidators could exit without damage to Compound.
Likelihood of hacker using Compound depends on DEX slippage.
Damage of hacker using Compound depends on liquidity across all exchanges.
So, what is the threshold for ‘large’?",36,32.0,2021-09-02
['Formal process for new collateral assets'],"You are right, what matters isn’t whether there are “large” holders but whether the Compound liquidation system can protect its suppliers if such a holder were hacked. The liquidation system is vulnerable to a price decline that is so large and so fast that borrower positions become insolvent before they can be liquidated. For example, if an asset has a collateral factor of 70%, then a sudden price drop of more than 30% can create underwater positions. These positions will be repeatedly liquidated until no collateral remains, but their debt will not be fully repaid.
The scenario I have in mind: A project treasury (or exchange hot wallet, etc) holding token XYZ is hacked. The hacker sells whatever they can via DEXes, causing a 30% price decline. The hacker supplies the remaining XYZ tokens as collateral to Compound, borrows ETH worth 70% of their value (at the old price), and walks away from the XYZ collateral.
Now the question is how the market responds to the instantaneous 30% drop in price on DEXes. If the global market price is resilient, then liquidators will be able to repay all the XYZ-backed debts without needing to seize all the XYZ collateral. However, during this process sales of seized XYZ will cause further downward pressure on global XYZ prices, possibly creating insolvent positions and protocol losses.
So deciding what is “large” means guessing how the market would react to a cascading liquidation event that dumps XYZ on the market from both the hacker’s abandoned position and from innocent XYZ-backed borrowers whose positions are suddenly vulnerable due to the event. It could be that the market could absorb the hacker’s position alone, but is overwhelmed by the subsequent avalanche. This depends on both global market liquidity and patterns of collateral use in Compound (and other) borrowing markets.
I don’t have a good answer. In the end I think it a subjective decision based on as much objective evidence as we can find.",30,45.8,2021-09-02
['Formal process for new collateral assets'],"On Coingecko they list a market depth of +/-2% in price. For 70% CF, maybe we would care about +/-30% market depth.
Somehow Coingecko (also other sites like coinmarketcap) has information for -2% market depth. Maybe they could tell us -30% market depth?
That may be impossible – they don’t know what new orders will be placed as prices drop. Most limit orders are likely near the current price, which would allow them to get an idea of +/-2% market depth.",28,5.4,2021-09-03
['Formal process for new collateral assets'],"Pause Risk
Pausable tokens represent a risk to Compound because a pause of token transfers could prevent liquidation.
If pausing happens because of a vulnerability, the pause could coincide with a price decrease. During the pause, Compound would not be able to liquidate bad debt. This is a risk to all markets.
The size of the risk is the collateral factor times the current value of the paused market’s collateral. The risk is likely to be focused on stable coins because they are the most frequently borrowed. But, even though volatile assets may not be the primary assets borrowed, they could also be at risk if their reserves are low.
Pause risk might be limited by a Collateral Cap or Supply Cap.
If a market is paused during a downturn, the result would look like slow liquidation.
The price drops. Debts are not repaid. The difference between the value of the collateral and the borrowed assets represents the damage to the reserves. If the difference exceeds the reserves, this could lead to a bank-run.
See the reserves per asset to know the size of Supply Cap/Collateral Cap needed to mitigate this risk.

Under what circumstances would they pause?",29,55.6,2021-09-15

['Add Market: RAI Reflex Index'],"With all of the talks of regulation, specifically, stablecoin regulation, I believe it is time to start supporting stablecoins that are not pegged to the USD.
USD-backed stablecoins have great centralization risks. While they provide great utility in terms of liquidity and while they fuel the growth of the ecosystem, the US government has an awful lot of power over them. Additionally, they have larger attack surfaces with owner accounts being able to mint, freeze, transfer, or burn the stablecoins their contracts control (depending on the stablecoin).
While DAI is a great stablecoin without the centralization concerns of fiat-backed stablecoins, it has two primary drawbacks.

It’s pegged to the USD and the US government may try to regulate it because of this.
It’s unable to use negative interest rates as a tool to stabilize its price.

This is where Rai Reflex Index comes in. It is backed solely by ETH and it utilizes positive and negative interest rates to keep the price stable. Furthermore, it uses a PID controller to stabilize the price. For those of you who don’t know what that is, it’s the same integral-calculus-based mechanism cars use to ensure that all the tires provide the same velocity, ensuring the car always goes straight forward when the wheels are pointed straight. PID controllers are very effective at providing stabilization.
With a trading volume of only $5M and a TVL of only $96M, the PID controller is doing an excellent job of stabilizing the price of RAI - currently floating around $3.
Adding RAI to Compound will give it greater strength and legitimacy. The more people using RAI and the more liquidity of RAI within common DeFi protocols, the more stable its price will be.
Furthermore, adding RAI to Compound will help in reducing centralization risks of USD-backed stablecoins, giving users an alternative in addition to DAI.
While RAI’s controller is currently controlled by a multi-sig, there are plans in motion to drastically minimize governance.
Let’s get the discussion going!

For example, we have to separate Fiat pegged stablecoins from flat stablecoins that are not pegged to any fiat but use another reference instead (inflation, basket, electricity price, ETH etc).
Stablecoin issuers generally use one of two mechanisms to keep stablecoin value pegged to that of a reference asset:


Asset-backed stablecoins maintain asset reserves in fiat or crypto as collateral

Algorithmic stablecoins use the automated execution of smart contracts to maintain price stability

Asset-backed stablecoins have raised concerns about security and whether they create direct contact points with the traditional financial system that might cause systemic risk.
Algorithmic stablecoins face primarily technological and operational risks, such as whether their smart contracts function as expected – It is possible to mitigate the unintended consequences of the protocol’s economics, incentives, and vulnerability by identifying and mitigating possible disruptions from malicious actors.

['Add Market: RAI Reflex Index'],"RAI offers an alternative to centralized stablecoins that DeFi needs and it would see significant use on Compound.
The ungovernance process aims to remove the ability to change key parameters and have a fully automated system. This means that RAI holders and minters won’t have to take into account governance risks when using the system. It should also prevent governments from directly interfering with RAI/Reflexer.
Ungovernance is a huge divergence from almost every other project in the DeFi space and a necessary hedge given the current regulatory climate in the United States and elsewhere.

  RAI is vastly underutilized within ETH DeFi. For a variety of reasons, we should change that.

Furthermore, I think RAI would see significant use on Compound on both the borrow and supply sides. I won’t get too in-depth into RAI’s PID mechanism but basically, if the RAI market price is above the “redemption price” (e.g. the target price that the system wants to achieve) then it begins to decrease the amount of collateral needed to mint RAI, which creates more sell pressure. Conversely, if the market price is below the redemption price, the system increases collateral requirements.
This means that during times of volatility there can be significant demand for borrowing and lending of RAI, which would generate significant revenue for Compound.",22,49.2,2021-10-06

Everyone is still earning COMP at the regular rate. We temporarily disabled the ability to view accrued COMP and also to claim it from the UI while we conduct our investigation. The ability for users to view their accrued COMP will be restored before proposal 64 goes to vote.
Proposal 64 does two things:

Fixes the accrual bug
Temporarily disables claiming COMP for the users potentially affected by the bug

After proposal 64 executes, there’ll be a follow-up proposal to fix the accrued COMP amounts for the users affected by this bug (set to the amount they fairly and rightfully earned). At this point, we’ll restore the ability for everyone to claim their COMP.
With that being said, everyone will continue accruing COMP at their normal and expected rates. This is true in the moments leading up to proposal 64 as well as after. The COMP fairly earned will without a doubt be given to users.
Users who have not interacted with the affected markets (those without COMP rewards) since proposal 62 was executed will be able to claim their COMP just fine. For those who have, I estimate it’ll take about a week for their ability to claim COMP to be restored.

I may be wrong on that but its hard to square that with what I can follow compound labs is doing with institutional investors, gateway, treasury. It could be I am misreading the situation, but it looks to me like the core of compound has been abandoned to the community, letting issues like this appear with no clear accountability (i.e. the community did it and the community will fix it) while the core team has moved on to other projects.

We are very lucky that this bug was only a bug that distributed more comp to other people and didn’t threaten the protocol.
The bug was exploited after proposal 62 was passed. Looking at the discussion thread for this proposal, there was not much testing outside of what TylerEther tested on his own as well as a deployment on the Ropsten testnet to check that it worked correctly, which only a few people tested.
One idea we should absolutely be doing is implementing large code changes on a copy of the current state of the Ethereum blockchain and observing the changes made to peoples addresses. We also need to encourage more people to help test these changes before it gets deployed. We shouldn’t be voting yes on proposals that make big changes unless its been through rigorous testing.
Another idea to avoid something like this from happening again is that we could give the multi sig the power to revert a proposal. Giving the multi sig this ability will be for emergencies that require quick responses, like the current comp distribution bug.

How TDD works is before writing your code you write tests for what you want the code to do, and then you test it during development. You start off with extremely simple code that solves the first test, and then add additional tests for each behavior the function should have. It would catch bugs like this almost immediately.
Also has the added benefit of producing simpler code, and speeds up later development. The initial development just takes longer. But, you end up with a much more robust code base.

Test driven development would do this too. If not using TDD, at least require code to have 100% branch coverage. I think 70% to 90% is the normal benchmark sought. But, since this involves potentially billions of dollars 100% might be a good idea.

Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases. This is as opposed to software being developed first and test cases created later.

['More Rigorous Process On Reviewing Large Code Changes (RE: Comp Bug 9/29/21)'],"Compound was built on being a stable, safe, error-free protocol. Over the last dozen proposals, bugs (of increasing consequence) have made their way into the protocol, culminating in Proposal 62, which distributed COMP incorrectly.
First off, I completely understand the mindset from the community that we need a rigorous process for evaluating proposals. Historically, all changes to the protocol were audited by Open Zeppelin and / or Trail of Bits, included complete code coverage and invariant testing (formal proofs), and were manually QA’ed on test-nets before any patches were pushed to production / governance. As more community members contribute patches, the process has become more ad hoc. This will be the case in any truly decentralized community, but we should ask ourselves what process we think makes sense to keep the protocol safe, and use Proposal 62 to immediately re-calibrate. We can use this framework to collectively evaluate if patches and changes have met that bar, a priori of discussing the deeper implications of those changes.

First, we should become a “default no” community instead of “default yes.” Patches are not considered safe until we (the community) collectively decide so. If a patch is put up too early, it’s fine to vote against it and ask for more checks and assurances from the developers or other community members.
Less is more. Patches should cover the smallest ground possible. Don’t refactor module X and change its behavior at the same time. This often leads to subtleties that are hard to evaluate and discover. Refactor a module with no changed behavior and then make your patch as a follow-up. Smaller changes are easier to evaluate and will help get a patch through significantly faster than grouping several changes together.
Testing should be crucial to any patch. This should include standard tests, “scenario” tests, and, if possible, invariant testing. Patches should be evaluated on test-net before being proposed to main-net. Every piece of evidence that the patch is safe should be evaluated and understood, with a special emphasis on looking for blind spots where there is no coverage (not just in line counts, but in actual real-life scenarios).
Communicate! Talk on the forums about your patch; ask other members in Discord; post it in draft form to a GitHub pull request. Get the juices flowing early so people can give directional signals and help make sure the best decisions are being made.
All patches should be audited. I understand that it can be difficult to coordinate an audit in a decentralized environment. The protocol could specifically reserve the time of an auditor in advance, or proposers could look to repay auditors as part of the proposal. Ideally, the protocol could retain enough time with an auditor which could be used flexibly, as proposals come up.
The protocol should offer a standing bounty to anyone who finds a vulnerability with a pending proposal. Implementors should have some amount of their reward escrowed for a period to evaluate that the patch works as intended before being released to the contributor.
The community should consider establishing a technical committee to establish development standards; review, and approve changes before they are proposed to governance.

Proposal 62 was a catalyst for us to improve, and build a world-class decentralized development process. The community will have to find the long-term balance of security and risk tolerance, but I know we can use this to get on the right track.
Excited to discuss any of the above.

['Protocol Emergency Brakes: Approving a set of Fast-Acting Governance Actions for protocol risk reduction'],"For certain situations, such as the recent COMP distribution bug, we may need faster acting Governance actions, especially around a standard set of actions that would reduce various operational or financial risks of the protocol (think of it like a fast acting emergency brake for the system). One example would be suspending the COMP distribution, or perhaps reducing the borrowing cap as I suggested last year. I feel this could be done two ways: one being a special type of fast governance vote, the other through community multi-sig.  The first step would be the same, a standard governance vote where we agree which sort of actions would fit this classification.  I’d be happy with either style implementation with a preference towards fast governance.

We could then have an emergency governance board that is quicker to action but requiring a 2/3 majority and a higher quorum to keep things secure (just an example of what’s possible).

I definitely think that should be explored more carefully, and perhaps it should be the framework for implementing this particular case.  To help simplify the discussion for this thread I think we should focus on this particular use case, since the parameter space of governance boards seems vast and might bog us down.  To be more precise, I see the “emergency brake” decision space basically being a subset of what a risk committee might do.
One concern about 2/3 majority is the possibility of something like a treasury exploit that needs to be fixed- not sure how much COMP is in treasury vs out, so need to think about that right % to handle this- you could argue a smaller percentage might be appropriate for a very fast, risk reducing emergency vote (or just quantify as a number of votes based on voter turnover from recent X proposals).  Another point to consider is  there’s a big potential difference in how many people actually vote vs have the right to vote, so we sort of need to normalize for that reality in the percentages required to pass an emergency governance vote, hence my interest in using a number rooted in number of votes on recent proposals.",33,41.6,2021-10-05

I like this idea. We could probably have the two approaches in parallel, (i) governance boards with the capability to change certain parameters in an accelerated fashion, and (ii) a pause guardian in case of emergency (maybe in the form of a [3/7] multi-sig) that could pause deposit/withdrawals, COMPS distribution and maybe outflow from the Treasury.

Push security patches that don’t break integration with other protocols
Change COMP distribution speed
Reserve factors?
Borrowing caps?

a pause guardian in case of emergency (maybe in the form of a [3/7] multi-sig) that could pause deposit/withdrawals, COMPS distribution and maybe outflow from the Treasury.


There’s already a Pause Guardian that controls Mint, Borrow, Transfer, and Liquidate. Assuming it still works as expected, adding distributeSupplierComp , distributeBorrowerComp , and claimComp under its control should be trivial.  I agree we should create a fast-acting govenance process, which I also discussed here. However, for the immediate-term, I believe updating the Pause Guardian is the simplest and lowest risk change we can make right now to protect ourselves from future bugs related to COMP distributions. If others agree, I can put a PR together.",20,18.8,2021-10-06
['Building a more robust deployment process to prevent future meltdown'],"I believe Compound needs a more robust deployment process if it is to stand the test of time. The recent COMP distribution bug and our inability to fix it for the next 7 days highlight the gaps in the current process. Improving the code review and testing process is a must, but still insufficient. Any stable software system needs the ability to quickly rollback changes, and rollout updates in a phased manner. No amount of code review and testing can compensate for this.

Rollback capability - it currently takes at least 7 days to make changes to the protocol. I know there are good reasons for this process, but we also need the ability to quickly deploy fixes in emergencies. As such, I propose that we create a separate process for rolling back changes. To prevent abuse, we can have different parameters around the process such as an elevated minimum votes required, max timelapse since deploy, versions that are eligible to be rolled back to (if possible), etc. IMO, as engineers, we are responsible to ensure a minimum level of safety in the systems we build, and I don’t think we will ever get there with the 7-day delay constraint. It’s like we are building a major bridge in San Francisco and not making it earthquake proof. Safety needs to come first.
Phased Rollout capability - a standard practice of traditional software that I believe we can implement on the blockchain to make Compound more robust. Similar to how AB tests are implemented, we can require all major code changes to branch users (into new code vs old code) based on a predefined schedule (e.g. Day 0 - 1%, Day 2 - 5%, Day 7 - 10%, etc). This gives us time to monitor changes, deploy fixes, and minimize the impact of bugs.

Robert mentioned on Discord recently that Compound is decentralized to “ensure that the protocol can run for 100 years”. That’s the future I want to see, and I believe we need to engineer a more robust system so that we can realize that dream. We are lucky that the recent bug was only around COMP distribution. It could have been much worse, and the story would have been that Compound is decentralized which caused the protocol to only last for 3 years. Let’s learn from this and ensure our future is the former and not the latter.",38,177.6,2021-09-30

['Building a more robust deployment process to prevent future meltdown'],"Agree that rollback capabilities would increase complexity. Perhaps the first step is to create a quicker deployment process (more votes required than normal) without restricting the change to rollbacks. Seems like this thread is suggesting the same.

Compound Developer Community Call Notes
Wednesday, November 11, 2020
Zenithlight - PID Interest Rate Controller (starts at 2:50)

Zenithlight shared an Interest Rate Controller project from the ETHOnline Hackathon, which would replace static interest rate models like JumpRateV2 with a PID (Proportional, Integral, Derivative) interest rate controller that targets a certain level of utilization in each market. The PID controller stabilizes the utilization of a market by changing the interest rate for borrowers over time, depending on how far above or below the utilization rate is from the target.
The next steps for Zenithlight are to code the PID interest rate models in Solidity, and simulate agents interacting with the models on a testnet. If the simulations are successful, Zenithlight will create a governance proposal for the community to vote on. You can view the PID Interest Rate Controller project written in Python in the Google Colab notebook here, and reach out to Zenithlight with any feedback or ideas.

Leighton - Credit Delegation (starts at 13:27)

Leighton brought up the idea of credit delegation, and whether it should be a part of the core protocol or an application built on top of the protocol.
Leighton wants to see if anyone developers are working on this, so reach out to him if this is a feature that you are interested in building.

Monet_supply - MakerDAO<>Compound collaborations (starts at 15:49)

Monet_supply discussed the possibility of Maker onboarding yield stablecoins, like cUSDC and cDAI, as collateral to mint DAI. This could help the Compound protocol address hypothetical liquidity crunches for DAI, as well as help Maker with any solvency concerns.
You view the following resources to dig deeper into this topic and voice your opinions in the Maker governance forum. Resources: cDAI collateral app, cUSDC collateral app, cToken collateral research, initial discussion.

Bhagwan - Collateral Warning Alerts (starts at 22:44)

Bhagwan discussed a push notification alert system for Compound borrowers, which would warn them when their collateral ratio is getting close to the liquidation threshold. Bhagwan has already built a gas price alert system called gasduck, which provided the inspiration for this new project.
Bhagwan is currently polishing the code for the borrowing alert system and plans to post it in the #development channel in the near future - so keep an eye out to review the code and provide feedback.

Timur - Governance Tracking Dashboard (starts at 25:20)

Timur shared his Compound governance tracking dashboard called Catflip, which reads data from the Governor to show changes from historical governance proposals, as well as the current parameters on all contracts like the Comptroller, Timelock, and all cTokens.
Timur is now thinking about adding information on delegates and interest rate models, so reach out to him with any feedback on what data to add next.

TennisBowling - Latest Governance Proposal (starts at 29:22)

TennisBowling shared his project called Aggregate, which allows users to stake stablecoins in order to mint a new stablecoin (AGG). At any time, users can send back the Aggregate to redeem their underlying stablecoins. TennisBowling is considering using Compound as the default vault to store the collateral assets, and has the below questions for the community:

Where should the interest go? To the devs as a “reward” or something? to the person redeeming the collateral?
How would we be able to see how much interest has been gained in this way?
If it goes to the devs, do you think that the users are up for paying a bit more gas to help us?
Do you think it will have a significant gas impact?


TennisBowling will post more information in the #development channel as the project nears completion, and is open to general feedback/ideas from the community.

Tarun - Vesting Proposal (starts at 31:08)

Tarun provided an update on the upcoming COMP vesting proposal, which now includes the ability for governance to approve COMP grants to developers who have made meaningful contributions to the protocol. This proposal also reduces the size of the Comptroller contract, allowing more room for future upgrades. The code is complete and currently being audited ahead of a planned governance proposal next week. The vesting functionality will initially be implemented with no vesting period, to allow the community to vote specifically on the vesting period in a later proposal.
Tarun is looking for the community to peer view the pull request, and for the community’s thoughts on the original forum post.

Getty - Asset Risk (Starts at 38:35)

Getty further explained his idea on an improved collateral factor system, that introduces a ‘safety score’ to more accurately assess asset risk. He makes the point that an asset with a 0% collateral factor still allows people to borrow the asset in large quantities, and thus creates a risk that it will be hard to liquidate.
Getty is looking for feedback from the community, so consider reading his blog post and reaching out with any ideas.

Zenithlight - Transferable Positions (Starts at 44:45)

Zenithlight introduced the idea of being able to transfer an entire supply and borrow position to another address, potentially with an associated price for the position.

I’d like to open a discussion about ways to encourage users to return excess COMP tokens they claimed due to the bug in proposal 62. One way to do this is through incentives/bounties.
In the interest of expediency, I’ll post some forum polls here to see if the community would support various incentive structures for those who return their incorrectly claimed COMP (or proceeds of selling the incorrectly claimed COMP).

We are actively working on building support for Compound inside of our app. This support will be on Layer-1 initially, but our UI is modular which will allow you to easily manage your funds from multiple L2s (or other L1s if they are supported in the app in the future).
September Developer Update: Developer Update - September 15th - Your Identity, Your Money
While borrowing wouldn’t necessarily be possible on L2 (at least until general purpose smart contracts are live with zkSync 2.0), we are planning to enable for people to have the ability to swap to interest bearing assets (using atomic swaps), so they can have access to these kinds of DeFi functionalities on L2, where it would be impossible to do so on L1 due to network fees. I’m also looking forward to seeing different Compound gateways created on various L2s!
Our team is incredibly passionate around building/curating educational content- there can literally never be enough of it out there! Our team has been doing this for the last few months building both written and video content (the latter being done by myself on TikTok). We’ve already begun building some for Compound, and obviously will continue to do so where we can. One example of written content can be found here: https://www.numio.one/tokens/comp/. There are a bunch of videos that have been made on TikTok about Compound as well.
In any case, I look forward to being more involved in the forums here, and hopefully meeting many of you IRL at different crypto events in the future!

['New Listing Proposal: PAXOS Stablecoin (PAX)'],"Introduction
Hi Compound community! We are Vishal Kankani and Spencer Applebaum from the Multicoin Capital team.
We are investors in Paxos through our Venture Fund and own COMP in our Hedge Fund. We would like to propose adding Paxos Standard (ticker: PAX) as a stablecoin on the Compound.finance platform.
As of 24th June 2021, as per CoinGecko:

PAX is the 7th largest USD-backed stablecoin with a market capitalization of approximately $900 million.

PAX ranks 5th in terms of number of global exchange listings (105).
There are 4 stablecoins that have more exchange listings: USDT, USDC, DAI and TUSD—all of which are listed on Compound already.

Based on the above data, PAX seems to be the next logical choice for stablecoins on Compound.finance. We propose adding support for PAX. We welcome comments and participation in this proposal from the community.
Overview
Paxos Standard (PAX) was launched in 2018 and is a USD stablecoin that is 100% backed by U.S. dollars. Paxos issues PAX, and both the company and the token are regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). PAX tokens are minted/burned based on client demand. The process for minting and burning has been approved by the NYDFS and is regularly audited by Withum, an advisory, tax and audit firm. Full PAX attestations are completed monthly and posted to www.paxos.com/attestations.
Paxos raised $142 million in December 2020 in its Series C investment round, bringing their total funding to more than $240 million. As stated by the company, Paxos’ main 2021 goals include increasing tokenized assets under custody and trustworthiness. Paxos not only has a NYDFS state Trust charter but also is the first crypto-native company to receive preliminary conditional approval from OCC for a de novo national Trust Bank charter. Furthermore, Paxos was the first digital asset company to get SOC2 Type 2 verified for custody, exchange and stablecoin product platforms. This follows their SOC1 Type 2 certification, which was granted in December 2020. These certifications ensure users’ data is compliant with their company policies, controls and regulatory requirements.
PAX Adoption Across DeFi and CeFi
PAX is included in MakerDAO’s pool and is available for trading on DeFi Apps, including Curve and Uniswap. It is used for lending and borrowing on known CeFi institutions such as BlockFi and Celsius. Additionally, it is traded on many centralized exchanges, including but not limited to Binance, Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Huobi Global, and OKEx. PAX daily traded volumes are greater than USD $50 million across CeFi & DeFi.
Proposal
We would like to extend PAX’s functionality in the DeFi space through listing on Compound.finance. We believe adding PAX to Compound.finance will provide users a trustworthy alternative crypto asset to post collateral and borrow. PAX is an excellent source of collateral because it is one of the most reliable, regulated stablecoins. PAX is valuable to borrow due to its trustworthiness and range of use cases, including store-of-value, settlement, collateral, trading, and peer-to-peer transfer.
Today, nearly 75% of the crypto assets deposited into Compound.finance are fiat-backed stablecoins, stablecoins partially backed by other fiat-backed stablecoins, and centrally wrapped BTC. Adding PAX diversifies Compound.finance’s exposure to any one centralized token issuer, while at the same time adding functionality and utility for a very trusted asset in the ecosystem. It would further diversify the menu of centralized stablecoins and stablecoins with differentiated utility on Compound.
We welcome comments and participation in this proposal from the community.
Price Feed Mechanism & Other Parameters
Currently, PAX is traded on Uniswap and Curve and we could use those price feeds. Also, if there are concerns around the daily traded volumes on these specific venues, we could start with a 0 collateral factor to mitigate short term concerns. An alternate approach would be to peg it to USDC as these two assets come with a very high level of assurances.
Initial Parameters (Open to suggestions)

Collateral Factor: 0-25%
Reserve Factor: 20-30%
COMP Speed: None
Borrow Cap: 80% of supply
Supply Cap: None
Price Feed ideas: Uniswap and/or Curve OR Peg to USDC
Interest Rate Models: USDC

Market data


Market Cap: ~$900 million

24hr trading volume: $50 - $100 million

Exchanges: Binance, itBit, Bitfinex, Coinsbit, Atomars, etc

Also, I think we should include collateral factor in initial proposal - it’s most regulated and trusted stablecoin on the market (NYDFS, OCC, SOCII, etc). Has potential to be big amongst institutions especially",37,37.4,2021-06-30
['New Listing Proposal: PAXOS Stablecoin (PAX)'],"I’ve spoken with Spencer Applebaum from Multicoin Capital and I am in support of this proposal.
PAX is one of the most regulated stablecoin around being regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”). This has the following benefits (taken from here):

The value of each stablecoin token is tied directly to the value of the US dollar, and the amount of “reserve” dollars equal or exceed the number of stablecoins outstanding.
Regulators are overseeing the establishment and maintenance of reserves backing the stablecoins.
Reserves may only be held in the safest forms, such as FDIC-insured bank accounts and in short-term maturity US Treasury instruments.
Reserves are fully segregated from corporate assets, specifically for the benefit of token holders, and are held bankruptcy remote pursuant to the New York Banking Law.

We compare the breakdowns of PAX vs. other stablecoins:

image2024×1012 217 KB


image1912×2048 127 KB

The underlying assets of PAX are much more liquid and stable compared to USDC and even more so than USDT.
I argue that the price of PAX will hold to a 1:1 ratio against the US dollar much better than USDC or USDT which are both listed on Compound for the reason of being strictly regulated by the NYDFS.
I’ve also gone ahead and looked into the smart contract code and its audits which all seem fine.
The first version of the PAX contract (upgradable contract) was audited 3 times and those audits can be found here: https://github.com/paxosglobal/paxos-gold-contract/tree/master/audit-reports/pax-audits.
Although the second (latest) version of the contract hasn’t been audited, the contract format is based on PAXG which has been audited twice: https://github.com/paxosglobal/paxos-gold-contract/tree/master/audit-reports/paxg-audits.
I’ve also asked about how the owner account of the contract is secured to which Spencer replied that it’s secured via a multisig contract: https://www.paxos.com/simple-multisig-how-it-works-and-why-its-awesome/.

['Add decentralized front-end deployment on Skynet & Homescreen'],"Currently, https://app.compound.finance/ points to an IPFS build that is deployed as part of the Github build process.
tl;dr; I propose that Compound (additionally) deploy to Skynet’s decentralized storage and integrate with Homescreen so users can pull updates, save builds to their personal decentralized cloud, and always be free to revert to previous versions of the front-end. This would require 1 additional step in the Github action, defining a secret key for publishing updates, and adding a button to the README for helping discoverability.
Background: Skynet is a decentralized storage protocol built on the Sia blockchain. Its goals are to let users and developers use decentralized storage without a wallet, cryptocurrency, or browser extension.
We recently created Homescreen because we saw a need for DeFi apps to have decentralized front-ends that users could actually benefit from (not just IPFS CIDs pointed to by DNS records.)
More information is available on Skynet Basics here.
More information on Homescreen integration is here.
If you want to try adding Compound to Homescreen, we support copying IPFS to Skynet (the update feature won’t work), so you can search for ipfs://QmZoA39BkfA1uosZ9C5WSgBh8vuRFwuvh9w6Drs1ZBtGDH

So I think there is a preliminary step here of getting a more robust Compound V2 subgraph up on TheGraph which is capable of supplying all the data that front-ends are currently pulling from the centralized API. Hopefully we’ll have someone / a team step up to tackle this early in Grants 2.0. Then this idea can probably move forward quickly.",15,27.8,2021-09-29

The main thing we’d be looking for from the compound team is adding a manifest to the github repo and a github action that signs the code every commit after an update, so that the homescreen app could check for updates and bring them to users. This doesn’t require Compound to host anything, and is really just along the same lines of what Compound is already doing with IPFS.
In the meantime, we’re happy to keep an unofficially signed version of the frontend. You can see that in action here: Compound on Homescreen
It’s permissionless, but it’s also being signed by outsiders as opposed to the dev team. Which is fine if you trust both the dev team and you trust Skynet Labs, but would be better if it was supported directly.",15,17.8,2021-09-29
['Add Market: G-UNI ERC20 Uniswap v3 positions'],"TLDR:
G-UNI pool tokens are ERC20 wrappers around static Uniswap v3 positions which make them fungible and their fee compounding automated. G-UNI tokens have recently been integrated by MakerDAO and Rari as collateral.
Using G-UNI tokens as collateral in Compound will enable many cool use cases, including 1) automatically repaying debt by selling off part of the collateral which naturally increases in value via earned fees on Uniswap v3 and 2) going leverage on Uniswap v3 liquidity positions enabling LPs to significantly increase their fees earned while making those markets very liquid for the wider community.
1. Who are we?
This collateral application was created by the Gelato Network development team. Gelato offers a series of automation services focussed on DeFi, including limit orders on AMMs, Aave liquidation protection and an automated liquidity provision solution for Uniswap v3 Liquidity provides called G-UNI, the latter being the proposed collateral type for this proposal.
2. High-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token:
G-UNI is an ERC20 wrapper around Uniswap v3 LP NFTs which can be used to make liquidity provision on Uniswap v3 fungible and its fee reinvestment process automated. It basically turns Uniswap V3s liquidity positions into Uniswap v2 like ERC20 tokens.
G-UNI tokens have already been adopted by a wide series of projects such as MakerDAO, Instadapp, Rari, Fei, and many more. There is also currently a governance proposal pending in the Aave governance forum for integrating G-UNI as collateral for their AMM markets.
Based on several discussions with Compound stakeholders and Uniswap v3 Liquidity providers, we believe that the G-UNI DAI / USDC, DAI / USDT and USDC / USDT pool tokens would provide great value to Compound users as an efficient way of utilizing their USDC, DAI and USDT collateral to borrow other tokens while earning compounding trading fees on Uniswap v3.
G-UNI tokens have the following functionalities:

Simplicity: Having a simple one size fits all liquidity strategy making market making very accessible for everyone as users don’t have to actively manage their position
Fee Compounding: Reinvesting the earned trading fees back into the pool resulting in an automated compounding effect
Fungibility: One Uniswap LP token is equal to another, meaning they can be used as money legos in other protocols such as on Maker for collateral or for liquidity mining schemes like what Instadapp is doing, making the underlying capital hyper-efficient

Users can always exchange G-UNI tokens for the corresponding underlying tokens (e.g. DAI & USDC) and the accrued fees that are currently being stored on Uniswap v3 by the G-UNI contract. G-UNI uses no external oracles or other dependencies and G-UNI tokens can be minted and burned at any point in time by liquidity providers.
G-UNI tokens can be created permissionlessly by anyone for any Uniswap v3 pool. However, this application only concerns one specific G-UNI pool which has DAI, USDC and USDT as the underlying tokens which are provided as liquidity on Uniswap v3. More G-UNI pools that have different underlying tokens can be added in separate Collateral Onboarding proposals in the future.
The automated reinvestment of fees is a key feature of G-UNI pools, which is conducted by bots of the Gelato Network which act similar to Maker Keepers. Those bots constantly monitor the accrued fees of each pool and execute the fee reinvestment function when sufficient fees have been collected and it is worth executing it. Ranges of the pools cannot be adjusted by bots and will remain static.
Each G-UNI pool takes a 1% cut of the accrued fees when reinvesting the fees for building, operating and further improving the G-UNI system.
You can watch a video of Gelato Legendary Member Ari Rodriguez explaining how G-UNI works here.
3. Brief history of the project:
Gelato Network was started 2 years ago by Hilmar Maximilian Orth and Luis Schliesske after working together with Gnosis on building automated trading functionalities on top of one of their decentralized exchanges. The two quickly realized that it was very cumbersome and hard to maintain specialized bots / keepers that have to be custom developed for each use case that requires some transactions to be executed automatically at certain times in the future.
Thus they ought to build a generalistic protocol that enables developers to plug into an already existing decentralized network of bots that they can task to execute arbitrary smart contract functions on Ethereum. Since launching in July 2020, many of the top projects in DeFi have integrated Gelato to power their web3 automation needs, including projects such as Instadapp, Zerion, Furucombo, KeeperDAO, Quickswap and AMMs such as Spookyswap.
Gelato’s development team not only builds the underlying protocol and the infrastructure, but also develops interesting automation use cases in-house themselves, of which G-UNI is one of them.
G-UNI contracts were tested thoroughly and audited by two external Audit companies as well as multiple times by the MakerDAO core development team. Having MakerDAO adopt the G-UNI framework should greatly reduce the risk for Compound as a lot of due diligence has been done from their side and all the necessary contracts for an integration have already been written (such as an Oracle contract that prices G-UNI tokens).

6. Use case of the applying collateral type:
G-UNI tokens are used to enable multiple parties to provide liquidity on Uniswap v3 collectively around the same range in a fungbile manner. The USDC / DAI G-UNI pool for example earns fees with a very concentrated liquidity around the $1 range (e.g. 0.9994 - 1.0014) of the DAI / USDC pair on Uniswap v3. Generated fees are directly reinvested into the pool and accounted for when LPs burn their G-UNI tokens in order to receive back the underlying DAI / USDC.
As the stablecoin pair prices should remain rather constant, we don’t need any readjustments of the range.
G-UNI would enable Compound users to go leverage on their Uniswap v3 positions and potentially 50x the liquidity they provide on Uniswap v3 and thus significantly increase their fees earned. This would enable users to take out loans using stablecoin collateralized G-UNI tokens as collateral, enabling cool features to be built on top such as automatically repaying one’s debt using the earned trading fees on Uniswap v3.
7. Exchange Venues:
The G-UNI DAI / USDC token is just a wrapper around regular DAI and USDC tokens which can be exchanged on multiple decentralized and centralized trading venues. G-UNI tokens can be burned at any time to redeem the underlying DAI / USDC based on the current ratio of the pool.
8. Token (& Protocol) permissions:
All pools will be immutable, as the upgradability key will or already has been burned.
Next Steps:
Like all asset listings we will list with a 0% collateral factor and once the community feels it is ready we can move to non-zero collateral factor. If the community likes this idea we are happy to help move this forward with deploying on testnet, setting up the oracles, and testing the additional markets.

['Compound Grants Program - Lessons and Next Steps'],"We started the Compound Grants Program with a simple idea in mind: let’s fund contributors that are working to make Compound better. Since we weren’t sure how many contributors there would be and how much money we would need to pay them to work on the protocol, we thought it best to start small.
Accordingly, the first iteration of Compound Grants Program (“CGP 1.0”) was funded with a little over $2M in COMP. After six months of operations, this program funded over 30 grantees with over $1M in funding. The CGP funded open-source dashboards, analytics, hackathons, and so much more. You can see a list of everything the CGP funded at this link.
From the start, CGP 1.0 was an experiment to see what a grants program managed by independent community members could look like. We learned a lot from running the experiment, and we’d like to share some of the key learnings below.
What Worked


Reasonable, but generous grant sizes. For most projects (Compound included), the bottleneck is not capital but contributors. That is, there is an abundant supply of capital but very few contributors that are willing (and able) to step up to the plate to do the work. Motivating contributors requires paying competitive salaries and grants.To that end, we have been generous (but reasonable) with grants, which has allowed us to attract incredibly talented contributors to work on improving Compound.


Attach milestones to grants. Milestones serve two purposes: they protect us from giving an upfront grant to someone who doesn’t end up doing the work and they encourage the grantee to continue delivering since that’s the only way to receive the full grant. Milestones have worked exceptionally well for us, and we’ll continue using them going forward.


Bet on doers. When we started Compound Grants we weren’t sure who would be able to do the work and who wouldn’t. It turns out that there’s a very easy way to tell who can deliver: people who have already done good work are likely to do it again. Our most successful grants went to “repeat contributors” — they’ve done it before and they’ll do it again.


What Didn’t Work


Launch and “they will come.” When we launched Compound Grants, we thought people would know what to work on. In retrospect, we should have known that it’s easy to boil the ocean when thinking about what to work on. What happened is applicants would apply for grants for all sorts of projects, putting us in the position of assigning priorities to applications after they were submitted. Instead, the right approach is for grants programs to understand the level of priorities for the protocol and put out RFP’s that community members can begin working on. We didn’t do that at first, but we learned quickly. Now, we have a list of RFP’s that are a priority for the protocol to complete and encourage community members to work on them.


2-week turnaround. Prior to launching Compound Grants, we did some research on how other crypto grants programs work. Across the board, the biggest “pain point” we heard was how slow grants programs operate: it would take months for applicants to hear back from the program, and by that point, they would not need money or they pivoted to working on something else. To solve this pain point, we decided to operate Compound Grants with a tight turnaround time: 2 weeks from application to grant. While we did a good job of being speedy, we didn’t hit our 2-week goal. There were several reason for that, with the biggest ones being (i) if you’re running grants in batches, the critical path is determined by the slowest applicants (which can take several weeks to process), (ii) larger grants can take significant up-front work to review and process, and (iii) yours truly is leading the grants program solo and part-time, which limits bandwidth for processing applications. What should we do to improve turn-around time? First, we should be more stringent with applicants: if applicants don’t submit the required information by a certain date, they forfeit the ability to receive a grant. Second, as the grant program matures from an experiment to something more sturdy, we recommend staffing the program with several full-time employees who can process grants in parallel. We’re not quite there yet, but this is something we’d like to actively work towards.


What Now?
Now that CGP 1.0 has concluded, we will put a pause on new grants. Over the next few weeks, we will finalize payouts to existing grantees and wrap up operations of the program. To provide us with adequate funding for essential expenses, we recommend keeping $250k worth of COMP in the existing CGP multisig. All unused COMP will be returned from the multisig back to the treasury. (To be more precise, we spent ~2.5k of the 5k COMP the program received in funding; we recommend keeping ~700 COMP  in the multisig as a reserve and sending the balance back to the treasury).
CGP 1.0 was an enormously successful experiment. We believe it’s now time to double-down on grants and make the program better, faster, and bigger than ever before. Over the next few months, we will be designing CGP 2.0. Our hope for CGP 2.0 is to build the best community-led organization, ever. That means staffing CGP with a full-time team, developing a clear communications process so the community knows what’s being worked on and what needs to be worked on, and constructing incentives for contributors to work on Compound exclusively. We need all the help we can get; if you’re interested in getting involved, please comment here and/or reach out on Discord.
Developing CGP 2.0 will take time, which is why we are pausing grants while we design the next iteration of the program. We can’t wait to share CGP 2.0 with you. Stay tuned!",68,2022.4,2021-09-13

['Compound Grants Program - Lessons and Next Steps'],"I think the next iteration of Grants should scale up and decentralize as much as possible. We need to target having a real DAO workforce & partnerships.
Some ideas:
Many-to-Many projects: In a DAO most people are not one-to-one on projects. Some of the most productive coders like Arroo and Tyler knock out multiple projects in one go and collaborate as needed. There needs to be a way to pay and track for multiple projects with multiple workers.
Streaming payments via Sablier - Related to the above, this will simplify and automate payments for complex projects. Streams can be opened and filled up by milestone, and if necessary stopped to claw back remaining grants.
Professional grant and project management - grant workers should also have project management experience and be able to connect talent to existing projects. They should drive accountability for milestones and keep clear lines of communication open to the DAO.

['Dynamic Risk Parameters'],"
Summary
A proposal for continuous market risk management to optimize yield, capital efficiency, and mitigate depositor losses.

Background
For almost two years now Gauntlet has formally and informally worked for Compound to perform market risk assessments, contribute to treasury management, optimize incentives, calibrate risk parameters, and upgrade the protocol. During that time Gauntlet has been able to refine our core models and agents specifically for autonomous interest rate protocol’s like Compound.
As the protocol continues to decentralize to the community our position is that dynamic risk parameters are a vital component to growth. Most protocol upgrades and maintenance impact market risk of the protocol. For example, the seize function and liquidator behavior. Or the introduction of Chainlink Price Feeds which has and will continue to facilitate the onboarding of new assets. How should the community reason about initial borrow caps? When should collateral factors be raised or lowered? How do individual assets and their parameterizations affect insolvency risk?

Proposal
In the following sections, we will outline the case and goals for dynamic risk parameters. The initial proposed scope has target metrics Gauntlet aims to improve. Those metrics are:

Risk-adjusted yield for Depositors
Capital efficiency for Borrowers
Mitigate Depositor losses

Gauntlet will improve the metrics above while controlling for protocol insolvency risk.
Illustrated in the governance example below are the benefits from a previous parametrization initiated and executed by Gauntlet. Additionally, we describe two initial areas for optimization that have been identified.

Compound Proposal 039
The ZRX, BAT, and WBTC Parameter Update governance proposal sought to change collateral factors with a primary focus on lowering WBTC. See the full thread for details.
To measure impact of this change we can look at the total WBTC liquidated on both the Aave and Compound protocols during the weeks of April 18-24, 2021 and May 17-23, 2021. The total liquidity available on the Compound and Aave was similar during these weeks. In addition, the volume of WBTC liquidated on Compound was less than 10% of the volume on Aave in April, which was closer to our parameter change. From there we mapped Compound positions from 2021-02-21 against the subsequent price movements. If users held unchanged positions, which is not uncommon, from before the collateral factor update through single-day price drops of 20% in April and 41% drop in May, then there would have been ~$7M to $9M additional collateral available for liquidation on each occasion.

1188×814 31 KB


Capital Efficiency for New Assets
Currently, the collateral factors for AAVE, LINK, MKR, SUSHI, and YFI are conservative. As the supply of these assets grows, ensuring any individual asset does not contribute outsized risk to the protocol is key. Existing simulation outputs suggest increasing collateral factors for all five assets by approximately 15% is optimal. Doing so would allow users to borrow an additional $31M in assets.
Making early capital efficiency improvements like this are possible because Gauntlet runs daily off-chain simulations. Informed by market data (liquidity, slippage, etc.) we will adjust collateral factors lower or higher as needed.

Reserve Factor Support
Gauntlet will also support reserve factor parameterization which is a key lever in driving revenue and growth (increasing yields/reducing interest paid). Previous conversation surrounding Reserve Factor Standardization has been had but no further analysis has been performed into the optimal settings to track default probabilities. Gauntlet concurs that:



Reserve Factor Standardization


Changing Reserve Factors does not immediately change the risk of the protocol (compared to changing a Collateral Factor), which should make them flexible levers to consider adjusting.


While a secondary parameter for risk, the reserve factor is a primary parameter for revenue and growth of the protocol. For example, when changing borrow caps consideration should also be given for the new optimal reserve factor.

Expectations


Risk Parameter Updates

Coverage of all markets except Legacy (e.g., WBTC) and Deprecated (e.g, SAI, REP)
Supported Risk Parameters: Collateral Factor, Close Factor, Borrow Cap, Reserve Factor, and Liquidation Incentive
Market conditions will determine the frequency of updates. For that reason, no SLA will be preset.



Communications

Risk parameter change steps:

Forum post (e.g.,Reduce COMP emissions by 20%)
Community discussion and revision
Off chain polling
On chain vote
Post-mortem


Quarterly, Gauntlet will poll the community to determine the preferred risk tolerance of the community. The outcome of this vote will determine the risk and capital efficiency tradeoffs Gauntlet will target.
Monthly forum posts and participation on community calls with explanations of risk parameter changes and any anomalies observed including but not limited to:

Discord Developer & Twitter Spaces Community Calls


Risk Dashboard (refer to the next section)
Quarterly Risk Reviews will provide a detailed retrospective on market risk.



Out of Scope

Protocol development work, (e.g. Solidity changes that improve risk/reward)
Formalized mechanism design outside of the supported parameters.
In line with keeping the scope small, Gauntlet will not look to manage the following at the outset:

Enabling or disabling a currency for borrowing
Setting interest rate strategies
Optimizing COMP emissions






Risk Dashboard
As part of this engagement, Gauntlet will build a Risk Dashboard and API for the community to provide key insights into risk and capital efficiency.

759×778 71.4 KB


754×1109 180 KB

Please note, all numbers are for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect the current or possible future state of Compound.
The dashboard focuses on both the system-level risk in Compound and the market risk on an individual collateral level. Our goal is to help convey our methodology to the community and provide visibility into why we are making specific parameter recommendations.
The two key metrics are Value at Risk (VaR) and Borrow Usage.
Value at Risk conveys capital at risk due to insolvencies and liquidations when markets are under duress (i.e., Black Thursday). The current VaR in the system breaks down by collateral type. We currently compute VaR (based on a measure of protocol insolvency) at the 95th percentile of our simulation runs assuming peak volatility in the past year. We do this using Compound’s current parameters as well as after modifying the parameters to the Gauntlet Recommendations.
Borrow Usage provides information about how aggressively depositors of collateral borrow against their supply. Defined on a per Asset level as:

where U is the utilization ratio of each user:

We aggregate this to a system level by taking a weighted sum of all the assets used as collateral.
To show Gauntlet’s impact, we measure these using the current system parameters and expected results (based on our simulations) if Compound were to implement the parameter recommendations suggested.

Cost
Gauntlet charges a service fee that seeks to be commensurate with the value we add to protocols. Gauntlet also wants to provide a strong signal of our alignment with the protocol. Using our prior COMP Contributor Grants  proposal we propose a service fee using the Contributor Comp Speed grant functionality. At the start of every quarter for one year Gauntlet will create a proposal to update the service fee payment in accordance with the forumla below.
The formula to calculate Gauntlet’s service fee has four components:

An asset multiplier to track risk management complexity
A proxy for capital efficiency
A marginal base fee
VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) of COMP

The asset multiplier calculation is log(Number of Assets, 10)*. New assets on the protocol add complexity to risk management. While the market risk optimization problem does not grow linearly, consideration should be taken when onboarding assets.
The most straightforward proxy for capital efficiency is the total borrowed for risk-managed assets. Capital efficiency is realized by borrowing demand. The total borrowed amount is calculated as the 30-day average and rounded down to the nearest $1B.
Gauntlet’s risk management marginal base fee is derived from a conservative estimation of the impact from dynamic risk parameters.




Marginal Base Fee
Total Borrow




10 bps
$0 - $5B


5 bps
$6B - $10B


2.5 bps
$11B - $15B


1.25 bps
$16B - $20B



The VWAP of COMP for the previous 30-days. Whether the price should be fixed or calculated quarterly, different communities have different opinions on how this aligns incentives. We will defer to the preference of the community but will default to calculating quarterly.

['Dynamic Risk Parameters'],"@inkymaze thank you for sharing this proposal on the Community Developer call this morning; a standard process to monitor & tune the risk parameters of the protocol is a long time coming (and one that I think the community should take!).
A few preliminary questions:

With respect to the metrics that Gauntlet intends to optimize (risk adjusted yield, capital efficiency for borrowers, and mitigating depositor losses), how will these be tracked? Will they be on the risk dashboard that Gauntlet plans to create, to monitor them over time?

Proposal 49 updated the liquidation mechanics to reduce the “cascade risk” of certain markets; has this functionality been included in the simulation models yet, or will it be prior to beginning dynamic risk parameterization?
How do you envision setting an acceptable “VaR” relative to reserves? How do you plan to include the community in this decision?
How are the proposed fees being set? Have community members weighed in on these?
Does Gauntlet plan to hold or dispose, vote or delegate its proposed COMP payment?

Initially the dashboard will track capital efficiency via Borrow Usage and risk via Value At Risk. From our initial user studies, these were the key metrics users wanted to see.
In addition to the dashboard, we will follow the outlined communications plan to capture anything that isn’t yet represented (i.e. Risk adjusted yield).
There are additional features on our roadmap like a visualization of users with undercollateralized loans and collateral liquidation ‘depth’. We plan on iterating on this dashboard over time and adding new features that we identify through continued community engagement.



 rleshner:

Proposal 49  updated the liquidation mechanics to reduce the “cascade risk” of certain markets; has this functionality been included in the simulation models yet, or will it be prior to beginning dynamic risk parameterization?


Proposal 49 routes a fraction of liquidation incentive from liquidators to the reserves. This change effectively allocates 5.2% of liquidation to liquidators and 2.8% to the reserves, which increases the protocol’s ability to recover from insolvency by growing the backstop liquidity, but reduces the incentive for liquidators. We will update the effective liquidator incentive to 5.2% in the simulation to accommodate the change.
Our current simulation is mainly focused on modeling insolvency risk in one day. Considering the average liquidation size relative to the sizes of reserves, the 2.8% of liquidations added to the reserves in a day will likely not have an immediate impact in such a short time frame. However, tracking the amount of reserves over time and forecasting the growth rate of the reserves due to parameter changes can definitely help community members to better understand the protocol’s liquidity backstop. Forecasting the reserve growth rate is not in our initial scope, but we will evaluate how to support this in Q1 2022.



 rleshner:

How do you envision setting an acceptable “VaR” relative to reserves? How do you plan to include the community in this decision?


Our primary goal for simulations is to standardize VaR across all assets, to ensure no subset of assets adds disproportionate risk to the protocol. We will target a similar system-level VaR to the current risk parameters as the moderate risk level recommendation. Additionally, we will provide aggressive/conservative risk level recommendations by targeting x% of capital efficiency increase/decrease.
As our philosophy is avoiding non-quantitative decisions, we don’t decide on what “acceptable” VaR relative to reserves is. We will facilitate the community’s decision-making process by creating quarterly off-chain polling for the community to decide this high-level objective. Community members can check our risk dashboard to get an estimate of VaR relative to reserves to understand the protocol’s ability to recover from insolvency events.



 rleshner:

How are the proposed fees being set? Have community members weighed in on these?


As mentioned above, Gauntlet seeks to charge commensurate to the value provided. This means measuring our work against the target metrics, communication objectives, and deliverables like the Risk Dashboard. We encourage the community to evaluate these items proactively and on a regular cadence ahead of our proposed quarterly fee update.
We have sought consultation from various community members, not solely our investors, and we encourage all others to use this thread to weigh in on the proposed fees.



 rleshner:

Does Gauntlet plan to hold or dispose, vote or delegate its proposed COMP payment?


Gauntlet is a firm believer in Compound’s mission and growth. As such, we plan on holding COMP tokens and self delegating for governance votes. Depending on Gauntlet’s cash flow needs, including but not limited to tax payments and operational expenses, we may need to sell tokens at a future date. For reference, we have not sold any of the COMP initially granted to us in Dec. 2020 via CP030.",47,129.2,2021-09-10
['Dynamic Risk Parameters'],"Overall I think this is a good step forward for Compound & Gauntlet. The protocol needs teams to analyze the protocol and provide input to improve the market further. Compound is a protocol of risk management. Without community members and users maintaining and improving the protocol, we won’t thrive.
At a high level, the proposal says Gauntlet will recommend collateral factors, borrow caps, reserve factors, and liquidation incentives based on their propriety simulations and a quarterly poll to determine the community’s risk tolerance.
Their key metric is Value at Risk or VaR.



 inkymaze:

The current VaR in the system breaks down by collateral type. We currently compute VaR (based on a measure of protocol insolvency) at the 95th percentile of our simulation runs assuming peak volatility in the past year.


The current Compound market is ~$8.5B borrowed, and there are 15 coins (excluding deprecated markets). That means we would pay Gauntlet 3,614 COMP or ~$1.67m for the quarter.
This isn’t a small amount of money to pay for an uncertain return. That being said, I think Gauntlet has demonstrated good intent. I will vote for this quarter, but I think the first quarter is a trial. I expect Gauntlet to deliver on all of the points below to secure a second quarter.


Build and maintain a dashboard that provides valuable insight and data.


Recommend collateral factors and provide sufficient evidence to back their recommendations.


Proactively support setting initial collateral for new assets.


Regularly interact with the community.

New markets are immediately supported. Gauntlet’s pricing is only adjusted quarterly.



 getty:

Do you have experience in recommending borrow caps & reserve factors? I didn’t see them mentioned in the latest Compound report.


Gauntlet provides Acala (Karura) debt ceiling recommendations. The debt ceiling recommendation may not be directly applicable to borrow caps, but we will modify our methodology to account for the difference. We are also preparing to recommend borrow caps for Benqi and Aave once supported.
For reserve factors, we have formulated the optimization problem in our more recent Aave Market Risk Assessment (see Appendix C.6). The function design will hold well for Compound.



 getty:


Does Compound have a point person at Gauntlet that community members can ask questions to?



The community should consider me the default but can expect communications from many people on the Gauntlet team across Product and Data Science.



 getty:

Do you have more info on how your Value at Risk statistic works? VaR isn’t mentioned in your most recent reports.


In our previous reports (both Aave and Compound), we focused on market risk and protocol resiliency. For example, in Aave, we used the key metrics of asset insolvency or safety module slashing to benchmark simulation runs. These numbers become difficult to compare to key metrics for yield and user borrow behavior metrics. In addition, the metrics can often be skewed for various market conditions. Our VaR metric will be a conflation of liquidation loss and insolvency metrics that can be quantified as some percentage of users’ capital that can make it easier to compare to upside (yield) metrics as well as scaled for tail market events.

['Dynamic Risk Parameters'],"I’m a big fan of the work @inkymaze is doing at Gauntlet — it’s important work, and almost nobody else is doing it. Given the size of Compound protocol (~$1.8 billion circulated market capitalization as of this writing), it strikes me as reasonable to pay vendors a lot of money to make sure things don’t break, particularly when the cost of breakage is potentially in the hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars.
Having said that, I do have several comments on the proposal.
Price & Fees


If we extrapolate the proposed quarterly fee, the protocol will be paying ~15k COMP to Gauntlet per year. At current prices, that’s nearly $5 million per year. If the price doubles in the next year due to good protocol performance, that fee swells to nearly $10 million per year. Put another way, the protocol would be diluting all COMP tokenholders approximately 0.56% per year to pay for the service. My sense is the fee is in the upper-range of what the protocol should be willing to pay. All at once, beggars can’t be choosers; it is good business for vendors to charge what the protocol is willing to pay! (Note: as a technical matter, Gauntlet will re-adjust fees every quarter, so the “final bill” will depend on a variety of variables at four points in time).


While this is by no means a popular view, I generally believe it’s a good idea to pay vendors in stable currencies like USDC or DAI. This achieves two things. First, it allows the protocol to know exactly what it’s paying for the service. The current fee structure is as complicated as it is volatile: the final bill can either be very low or very high, and the protocol will only find out what it’s paying after the fact. Second, paying in stable currencies decreases dilution for existing tokenholders. If the protocol pays every vendor millions of dollars worth of COMP, dilution may spiral out of control. I believe it’s prudent to keep an eye on dilution. Establishing standards by which vendors are paid is a path towards doing so. (Note: converting COMP that is sitting in the treasury to USDC/DAI may be complicated from an operations/tax perspective, so perhaps this point is an aspirational one).


The Process


Judging by the relatively few responses to this thread, my concern is most tokenholders don’t fully understand what’s being proposed here. That’s not a diss to @inkymaze’s writing. Rather, I believe it’s a sign that the needs of the protocol have advanced beyond the capability of the average tokenholder. In short, I no longer think it makes sense for tokenholders to vote on technical proposals such as this one. Rather, it strikes me as reasonable to bring together a small group of experts who can review proposals such as this one on behalf of tokenholders. We can call them the “Risk Committee” or “Vendor Due Diligence Group” or perhaps another fancy name. Either way, they’d have way more experience and ability reviewing proposals like this one than a broad base of busy and un-expert tokenholders.


When companies make large purchases, they typically run a bidding process to allow multiple vendors to compete for the work. This accomplishes several things: it allows (i) companies to receive the best price, (ii) vendors to compete with each other to offer the best product/service, and (iii) vendors who are new to the scene to have a fair shot at selling their product/service to the company. Perhaps Compound protocol can do the same? It would be fairly easy to set up a bidding process for other vendors to come in and bid for the work Gauntlet is proposing. It’s a big win for Compound protocol to let the best vendor win!


All in all, I am in support of Gauntlet’s proposal. But I strongly believe we need to get more sophisticated on evaluating proposals like this one going forward.",31,355.8,2021-09-22

Denominating the contract in USD is very similar to paying it in USD from the protocol perspective. Paying it in USD means that 100% of the COMP is sold on the market, paying it in COMP allows contributors/vendors to divest over time as needed. Also, while everyone here is bullish Compound and DeFi, this week’s price action expose the risk Gauntlet and future contributors face taking payment in COMP.



 blck:

How will the protocol pay this amount to Gauntlet when there will be no more COMP left, the amount requested in the proposal would be significant part of the “reserves” that currently the protocol generates from interest.


@sukernik and @monet-supply have also raised similar concerns. The alignment of incentives is something we are keen to iterate on with this community. For example, the marginal bps pricing structure was not implemented in our formula for Aave but something we intend to incorporate at renewal following community feedback.
One separate thought experiment is what if Compound does not charge reserves at all? Would all contributor grants stop? Reserves and other revenue could be sacrificed for growth, this wouldn’t mean that Gauntlet, Getty, or others should provide any more or less value.

Our Risk Dashboard gives insight into our methodology.

We provide a variety of different metrics including, how system collateralization ratio, amount of collateral liquidated, and net insolvent debt % are affected by tweaking specific parameters.



 jthrack:

Also, is there a third party that reviews the risk models/sims and dashboard to make sure they are bug free and/or verifies the efficacy of methods used?

 sukernik:

I’m glad you brought this up! The reason I disagree with this approach is that it is misaligned with the role of COMP as a governance token. Vendors and contributors should be willing to be rewarded with governance rights (COMP), because that is what the protocol can directly offer for their contributions.
If recipients want to trade those rights on the open market for stablecoins, or ETH, or a fiat currency, they are welcome to do so. Importantly, the protocol bears no control and no liability related to that decision. I don’t see it as incumbent on the protocol or its governors to shoulder any burdens or risks associated with trading of the COMP token on behalf of prospective recipients.",30,40.6,2021-09-22
['Dynamic Risk Parameters'],"Thanks for the reply @allthecolors. It’s less about the protocol making trading decisions on behalf of vendors and more about the protocol making a sound financial decision for itself.
For example, at some point in the future, it’s very likely that COMP will find itself undervalued by the market due to various market forces (e.g., bear market). At this point in time, issuing COMP to vendors would be a financially disastrous decision for the protocol: in effect, the protocol would be issuing tokens for less than their intrinsic value. It would be the equivalent of selling something you know is worth one dollar for 80 cents.
While we are on the topic, it’s worth pointing out that vendors who are interested in aligning incentives with Compound could always purchase COMP with the stablecoins they are paid in. To me, using your hard-earned cash to purchase something is the strongest signal there is!",30,80.6,2021-09-22
['Dynamic Risk Parameters'],"I strongly support this proposal even though I’d like to see an open-source non-proprietary risk model developed for Compound. Since we don’t have any such model, using Gaunlet’s proprietary solution is currently our best approach to managing market risk.
I agree with @sukernik’s point on paying vendors in stablecoins, although Compound’s treasury is composed of COMP and I am against the treasury selling COMP for stablecoins. Compound has a great need for a treasury board to manage and grow its capital. Debt leveraging, investing, and yield farming are very effective tools the treasury could use to grow its capital and maintain its cash stablecoin flow.

['RFP 16: Dynamic COMP reward distribution'],"Upon browsing Compound Grants I noticed a proposal request related to an idea I had earlier: Weighted Algorithmic COMP Distribution, so I’ve taken this request under my wing.

What
This proposal splits COMP rewards distributions between borrowers and suppliers. Upon passing, governance will be enabled to set reward rates specifically for borrowers vs. suppliers in any market.
Example: ZRX currently has a distribution rate of 0.0014625 per block - 0.0014625 for suppliers and 0.0014625 for borrowers. This can be changed to 0.002925 for suppliers and 0 for borrowers, the inverse, or anything in-between (or higher/lower).

Why
If governance is able to change the ratio, we can more effectively incentivize, develop, and maintain markets. For example, distributing all rewards for a market to its suppliers is a good way to incentivize deposits. Or we could distribute more to borrowers to incentivize borrowing.

How
Call Comptroller#_setCompSpeeds(cToken …, supplySpeed …, borrowSpeed …).

As I mentioned in the Compound Developer Community Call, I’d love to see community members help test this improvement. Here’s how you can help.

Testing distribution rates

Setup

Switch over to the Ropsten testnet


Get some ETH from here or here

Use Compound’s faucets to get all other tokens (other than COMP)… go to the app dashboard

Select a token you want to get from the faucet, go to the withdraw tab, click on the “FAUCET” link, then send the transaction. Once confirmed, you’ll receive some tokens.

(Optional) Swap ETH for other tokens using Uniswap or Sushiswap if you want more than what the Compound faucet provides.


Testing

Distribution rates
We want to ensure that COMP is distributed correctly as per the rates in the post above.
To do this, deposit and/or borrow some tokens. The amount of COMP you should receive is as follows.
accrued(COMP) = sum of: for each market, for both supply-side and borrow-side, delta blocks * user portion of market * rate for market
Where delta blocks is the change in block number from the time you borrowed/supplied to the time you withdrew/repayed (or present), and the rate for market as defined in the post above.
Example: If I supply 10% of the TVL for the BAT (supply-side) market for 100 blocks, I should receive 100 * 0.10 * supplyRate(UNI) = 100 * 0.10 * 0.0002 COMP = 0.002 COMP
You can get the block number for each transaction by viewing the transaction on Etherscan.
It’s simple to calculate the rates when you’re only active in one market, but it gets more complex with the more markets you’re active in. It’s important to test that the distribution rates are correct when active in multiple markets on both the supply-side and borrow-side.

Claiming
We want to ensure that users are able to successfully claim their accrued COMP. Please try claiming such and let us know if you’re unable to.

Go to the Etherscan page for the contract (search by address), go to the “Contract” tab, then click on “Read Contract” (ex: https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x2973e69b20563bcc66dC63Bde153072c33eF37fe#readContract)
If borrowing in this cToken market, read totalBorrows. Otherwise, read totalSupply.
Add the amount you are borrowing/supplying to totalBorrows/totalSupply (respectively)
Divide the amount of the underlying you are borrowing/supplying (mantissa) by totalBorrows/totalSupply (respectively) to get the portion of the market.

Example for borrowing 1000 USDC:

USDC has 6 decimal places, so the mantissa USDC amount is 1000e6 = 1000000000
At this time, totalBorrows = 1115004256069
After my borrow transaction, totalBorrows = 1115004256069 + 1000000000 = 1116004256069
Portion of market = 1000000000/1116004256069 = 0.000896 = 0.0896%

['RFP 16: Dynamic COMP reward distribution'],"Gauntlet has reviewed the patch and will will be voting FOR. It is good to see additional scenario tests added on the supply/borrow for set/reset which can test permutations of borrow and supply.
The potential long-term drawback of this approach is if we did end up in a situation where COMP had a lot of markets and most of them don’t offer COMP rewards. That would be inefficient since functions like claimComp would always check each market for rewards. In any case, this is hard to avoid because some users have accrued rewards from before a market was unCOMPed. In the future, there could be a fastClaimComp function that slightly saves gas by only attempting to claim for markets with non-zero borrow/supply speeds. In that case, a user would call claimComp first to “clear” their record for any removed markets and then fastClaim from thereon.",22,159.4,2021-09-23
['Comptroller: compSpeed bug'],"Note: All funds are safe. No urgent action is required.
This afternoon @TylerEther messaged me that he might have found a bug related to setting a compSpeed for already listed markets with a current speed of 0. @elee and @TylerEther were able to diagnose the bug and provide a fix.

Bug 1:
When attempting to run the scenario that checks adding a compSpeed for cMKR and the mint cMKR we get an integer underflow error for the mint.
This was happening on line 1161, here compound-protocol/Comptroller.sol at master · compound-finance/compound-protocol · GitHub
function distributeSupplierComp(address cToken, address supplier) internal {
	CompMarketState storage supplyState = compSupplyState[cToken];
	Double memory supplyIndex = Double({mantissa: supplyState.index});
	Double memory supplierIndex = Double({mantissa: compSupplierIndex[cToken][supplier]});
	compSupplierIndex[cToken][supplier] = supplyIndex.mantissa;
	if (supplierIndex.mantissa == 0 && supplyIndex.mantissa > 0) {
	supplierIndex.mantissa = compInitialIndex;
	}

	Double memory deltaIndex = sub_(supplyIndex, supplierIndex); <<< RIGHT HERE!!!!
	uint supplierTokens = CToken(cToken).balanceOf(supplier);
	uint supplierDelta = mul_(supplierTokens, deltaIndex);
	uint supplierAccrued = add_(compAccrued[supplier], supplierDelta);
	compAccrued[supplier] = supplierAccrued;
	emit DistributedSupplierComp(CToken(cToken), supplier, supplierDelta, supplyIndex.mantissa);
}

This happened because the supplyIndex was smaller than the supplierIndex.
Why? Looking at the code, supplyIndex is obtained through these two lines.
CompMarketState storage supplyState = compSupplyState[cToken]; <<< RIGHT HERE!!!!

Double memory supplyIndex = Double({mantissa: supplyState.index});

After some looking, we found the issue is supplyState.index was not being set to the correct number because when supplyState/borrowState already has an entry with block information, and the current compSpeed is equal to zero, we do not update the market state.
Here is the function where supplyState is set: compound-protocol/Comptroller.sol at master · compound-finance/compound-protocol · GitHub
function setCompSpeedInternal(CToken cToken, uint compSpeed) internal {
	uint currentCompSpeed = compSpeeds[address(cToken)];
	if (currentCompSpeed != 0) {
		// note that COMP speed could be set to 0 to halt liquidity rewards for a market
		Exp memory borrowIndex = Exp({mantissa: cToken.borrowIndex()});
		updateCompSupplyIndex(address(cToken));
		updateCompBorrowIndex(address(cToken), borrowIndex);
	} else if (compSpeed != 0) {
		// Add the COMP market
		Market storage market = markets[address(cToken)];
		require(market.isListed == true, ""comp market is not listed"");
		if (compSupplyState[address(cToken)].index == 0 && compSupplyState[address(cToken)].block == 0) {
	compSupplyState[address(cToken)] = CompMarketState({
			index: compInitialIndex,
			block: safe32(getBlockNumber(), ""block number exceeds 32 bits"")
		});
	}
	if (compBorrowState[address(cToken)].index == 0 && compBorrowState[address(cToken)].block == 0) {
		compBorrowState[address(cToken)] = CompMarketState({
			index: compInitialIndex,
			block: safe32(getBlockNumber(), ""block number exceeds 32 bits"")
			});
		}
	}
	if (currentCompSpeed != compSpeed) {
		compSpeeds[address(cToken)] = compSpeed;
		emit CompSpeedUpdated(cToken, compSpeed);
	}
}

Importantly, look at these statements.
if (currentCompSpeed != 0) {
		// note that COMP speed could be set to 0 to halt liquidity rewards for a market
		Exp memory borrowIndex = Exp({mantissa: cToken.borrowIndex()});
		updateCompSupplyIndex(address(cToken));
		updateCompBorrowIndex(address(cToken), borrowIndex);
	}

if (compSupplyState[address(cToken)].index == 0 && compSupplyState[address(cToken)].block == 0) {
	compSupplyState[address(cToken)] = CompMarketState({
			index: compInitialIndex,
			block: safe32(getBlockNumber(), ""block number exceeds 32 bits"")
		});
	}

If the block isn’t zero, it won’t set a compMarketState and since currentCompSpeed is 0, it does not update it either.
This can be fixed with the following change (@TylerEther)
if (compSupplyState[address(cToken)].index == 0) {
	compSupplyState[address(cToken)] = CompMarketState({
		index: compInitialIndex,
		block: safe32(getBlockNumber(), ""block number exceeds 32 bits"")
	});
} else {
	compSupplyState[address(cToken)].block = safe32(getBlockNumber(), ""block number exceeds 32 bits"");
}

Instead of not setting the entry when block != 0, we instead update the entry.

Bug 2
This patch also fixes another separate but related bug.
Previously, if the compSpeed for a token was set above 0 at block [A], set back to 0 at block [B], then set to positive number R at block [C], since there would have already been an index & block set, the block number would get updated with market activity, but the index would remain at the index of [B].
This meant that at block [C], rewards would be accrued from the block of the last market activity prior to [C] using the rate R.
This was incorrect, as COMP accrued at rate R should only be calculated from when it was set, aka block [C].
As the patch now properly updates the block value of the market state to [C], interest will then be corrected properly, using rate R between blocks [C] and [C]+N.

This PR fixes two separate but related bugs involving COMP accrual.

- Bug 1: …borrow/supply state index not properly set when an active market gets its compSpeed set for the first time causing the market to get bricked.
- Bug 2: extra interest is accrued in markets where their compSpeed is non-zero, set to zero, then set to non-zero again with time and market activity in-between.

Note: Test cases need to be written to ensure both of these bugs never occur again (should be put in spec/scenario/Flywheel/Flywheel.scen).

['Whitelist of addresses that can create proposals'],"A number of key community members lack sufficient COMP to create governance proposals. We want to keep the proposal threshold high to avoid spam but also want to create a smooth governance experience for those dedicating time and effort to improving the protocol. Gaining sufficient delegation to a CAP isn’t a huge issue for one-off proposals/contributors but is more of a hassle for frequent contributors.
For example, Compound is now paying @getty  indefinitely for contributing to the protocol but still requires him to rally 65k COMP to propose an improvement. Assuming Getty is the first of many contributors that have longer-term economic relationships with the Compound Protocol, it may make sense to grant these individuals special privileges in governance (namely, the right to propose).
One solution: create a whitelist of addresses that can create proposals. Rather than just checking to see if an address has 65k COMP delegated to it, we could also check to see if the proposer’s address is on a whitelist of trusted community contributors, allowing them to sidestep the COMP requirement.
@arr00  took the lead on ironing out the implementation details of this. The code below allows addresses to be whitelisted for a specified period of time, after which the special authority expires.
Comparing compound-finance:master...arr00:whitelist-users · compound-finance/compound-protocol · GitHub.
Still to decide:

Who manages the whitelist — governance or a multisig?
Proposals from whitelisted addresses can’t be canceled for falling below the proposal threshold, so perhaps we allow a multisig to cancel proposals from whitelisted proposers?

Admittedly, this is a pretty minor possible improvement on the governance process (and there are some hacky ways to accomplish a similar result), but the bigger point here is that we should be empowering key community contributors with the tools they need to contribute actively to the Compound Protocol (a mix of funding, resources, privileges, etc).",82,721.4,2021-07-15

I am in the process of trying to get 65k votes (I have ~11k rn) so I can propose myself. There are many low-hanging items the protocol should be maintaining/adding, but due to my limited ability to create proposals, I tend to pick one big improvement/issue at a time.

What if we just rebuilt the Autonomous Proposal contract to be a single contract (not a factory) that accepts proposals from only a whitelisted group of individuals, but then the larger comp community can delegate their voting power to this contract.
Governance would be responsible for adding or removing whitelisted addresses, but the community would still be responsible for delegating their voting power to the contract itself. This way if the community were to lose faith in the white listed individuals, it would be easy enough to remove delegation power.
I get that rounding up the delegated votes is tricky, but I think folks would be up for doing it once to a single contract, and I like the social dynamic more than making a chance on the governance contracts themselves.",64,57.8,2021-07-20

One issue related to the current way CAPs work IIRC: I think certain community members should always have the freedom to propose things to the community, but we may not always agree with them (or would like token holders to have veto power), so letting them always use capital in a CAP to propose & vote would not be ideal.

On top of this, the risk of giving people these permissions is low - mostly just proposal spam, which is unlikely and further mitigated by gas costs.
While its valuable for token holders to enable more progress within the protocol between votes, I think the impact this change is quite small at the moment.  Arr00 mentions this as well - “the limitation on throughput is quite significant”. We might want to consider other changes that would give power to the community, but would more directly target specific use cases. For instance, allowing a specific group of people (e.g. a subDAO) to change a subset of parameters. You could imagine an Interest Rate Group that could change IR curve for different assets (within some limits).  This would allow the the community to increase its pace of contribution, probably even more so than via address whitelisting.  At the same time, this would continue to enable the helpful restrictions on protocol changes that governance currently provides.
On @getty’s community call, @JacobPPhillips mentioned this would be hopefully the first of many changes to increase the speed of Compound governance. We’re looking forward to continue the discussion and work with the community to see this come to fruition.",54,145.8,2021-07-22
['Whitelist of addresses that can create proposals'],"I’m approaching completion with the engineering work for this project and would like to provide an update on the technical details of the implementation. This is the first update to the Governor Bravo implementation and acts as an example of how to update the Governance system.
At a high level, the new features allows for governance or the community multisig to set whitelist status expirations for any account. It was done with this format to introduce a concept of a term to governance. Users are granted special permission for a limited time and need to actively participate and perform to have their special status renewed. This term is set as an expiration timestamp after which their special whitelist status expires.
Due to the whitelist status, whitelisted proposals can’t be canceled for falling below the proposal threshold, so as a safety precaution, the community multisig will be able to cancel these proposals. It is unlikely that this feature will ever be used. The community multisig does not receive unlimited veto powers—it is only able to cancel proposals from users with less votes than the proposal threshold.

Technical Details
You can view the code changes here.
I have opted to create two new stored values:


whitelistAccountExpirations - an array of timestamp expirations for the whitelist status of each account. An account is whitelisted if now < whitelistAccountExpirations[msg.sender].

whitelistGuardian - an address which is in charge of monitoring and setting whitelisted accounts. The whitelistGuardian will initially be the community multisig. The whitelistGuardian is able to add and remove whitelistedAccounts and cancel proposals by whitelisted accounts. The guardian is unable to cancel a proposal by an account which meets the proposal threshold.

There are three new functions:


isWhitelisted(address account) - isWhitelisted returns a boolean value of whether an account is whitelisted. This logic is isolated into its own function for readability.

_setWhitelistAccountExpiration(address account, uint expiration) - setWhitelistAccountExpiration stores a new expiration for a given account’s whitelist status. An expiration of 0 removes the account from the whitelist. This is a permissioned function callable by governance and the whitelistGuardian.

_setWhitelistGuardian(address account) - This function sets the whitelistGuardian. It is a permissioned function only callable by governance.

"[""Educating users about UIs after Labs' hand-off""]","Compound Labs’ decision to open-source its front-end to the protocol and move hosting to IPFS are important steps in the decentralization of the protocol. Given the criticism around Uniswap Labs’ blacklisting of certain synthetic and derivative assets on its hosted UI, Compound Labs presents a different way forward here.
That said, this change – particularly the redirection of Compound Labs’ app.compound.finance to the IPFS hosted interface with its cumbersome URL – has introduced some possibly underappreciated risks to user confidence and is creating a lot of undue stress for ordinary users. Evidence from the protocol’s Discord server suggests that many casual users are having at least a moment of panic when they get redirected to a URL they don’t recognize and see what appears to be a clone of the Compound Labs interface requesting access to their wallet. It’s natural for these users to worry that they or the Compound Labs’ UI might have been phished or worse, shaking confidence in the protocol as a safe place to earn yield on their digital assets.
This move is good for decentralization, but it happened very quickly by the standards of most typical users and was introduced without much of any warning on app.compound.finance itself. I would argue that most users who deposited via the Labs interface are still unaware that this change took place and that if the wrong narrative took hold, the suddenness of the change and the sketchy appearance of the IPFS URL are both legitimate threats to the protocol’s reputation (backwards as that may feel for those who understand the reasons for the change).
There are many things we could do as a community to mitigate this risk. We have other community-developed UIs in the pipeline which is great; @getty has registered an ENS for the Compound multi-sig to control hosting of this UI, which is also a great start.
But I think the most important thing we can do in the short term is to create a new splash page or banner on the interface, before asking users to connect their wallet, that explains the change and provides links for users to educate themselves about it / verify the accuracy of the redirect.
I think it would boost confidence the most if this splash page were actually built by Compound Labs and hosted at app.compound.finance by Compound Labs, perhaps no longer automatically redirecting to the IPFS site. This would arguably be better than a redirect from a decentralization perspective; I could imagine that some courts might not care so much about the distinction between hosting a website and hosting a redirect to a website outside of Labs’ control.
Curious whether others feel the IPFS redirect is an urgent issue. Forum participants are among the most well-educated of the protocol’s users when it comes to ethereum infrastructure, so I worry we might be underestimating the damage we’re inadvertently causing to user confidence here.",34,101.8,2021-09-19

['PROPOSAL: Distribute DAI to Users Affected by DAI Liquidations'],"
Formal Proposal: Distribute DAI to Users Affected by DAI Liquidations

OBJECTIVES
This post will outline an on-chain proposal that will compensate users affected by the liquidation events of November 26th, 2020 in the DAI market. After feedback and discussions, this proposal’s code will be published on-chain in collaboration with those that support this methodology.
Thank you to the Compound community and investors for the weeks of feedback, iteration and discussions that have helped craft this proposal.
BACKGROUND
On November 26th, 2020 an unexpected increase in the DAI price to $1.30 on Coinbase Pro led to 85.2 million in DAI being liquidated. An initial compensation proposal for that event did not pass an executive vote, with 680k COMP voting against and 212k COMP voting for.
Since the original proposal, there have been positive changes in Compound’s oracle system and improvements in the state of the DAI market’s reserves. The oracle fix and the increased DAI reserves address three key issues voiced by the community with the previous compensation proposal:

Reimbursement to users before clarity on when/how the underlying issue would be fixed.
Reimbursement denominated in COMP to affected users may not necessarily align with the objectives of COMP usage or COMP holders.
Setting a precedent that tail-risk events should be subsidized with COMP.

Today, the 15.1 million DAI in reserves is sufficient to cover the November 26th losses as originally calculated in full. The total expected compensation amount is approximately 6.8 million DAI based on the protocol’s 8% liquidation penalty. Compensation is well within the capabilities of Compound governance today and will help give closure to a topic that’s still a point of ongoing discussion in the community and allow the protocol to move forward on stronger footing.
CODE MECHANICS
This proposal utilizes a slightly modified version of the merkle distributor used for the airdrop of Uniswap’s UNI token. The merkle tree contains the addresses of those affected by the liquidation event, and was reconciled and analyzed against on-chain data from around the time of the liquidation event. A relayer will claim the merkle drop for each wallet according to the distributor and distribute the DAI to user’s wallets. Users do not need to interact with any contract to claim this DAI.
The script to generate the affected addresses list (and distribute DAI to them) fetches the liquidation transactions which repaid DAI within the given block bounds (11332733 to 11335286). The repaid DAI is multiplied by 0.08 to attain the liquidation fee incurred by the affected address. If a wallet had 100 DAI repaid by a liquidator, then that wallet would receive 8 DAI as part of this compensation proposal.
Full coverage is ensured through unit testing, forking simulation and a testrun of the whole proposal process on testnet. @arr00 arr00 is the core contributor to the code.
DISTRIBUTION METHODOLOGY
Referencing the DAI liquidations spreadsheet published by @rleshner, a total of 85,220,406.43 DAI was repaid on 11/26/20. Applying the 8% liquidation penalty, this proposal would pay out a total of 6,817,632.51 DAI.
To preview the DAI distribution per address, see here.
Action Items
If you support this proposal, you can delegate COMP to this autonomous proposal (CAP), which will be deployed after allowing sufficient time for the community to review the code and proposal.
Again, thank you to the Compound community and investors for the weeks of feedback, iteration and discussions that have helped craft this proposal.

For full transparency, I was one of the Compound users affected in the DAI liquidation event and believe this governance owes it to the community to consider this proposal. For context, in 2020, I worked with the community to pass a reserve factor change to the DAI market and improve the overall risk positioning of the Compound protocol.

['PROPOSAL: Distribute DAI to Users Affected by DAI Liquidations'],"I see there are two accounts making up the vast majority of compensation amounts:
“0x909b443761bbD7fbB876Ecde71a37E1433f6af6f”: “3691394.287603915”
“0xB1AdceddB2941033a090dD166a462fe1c2029484”: “1401662.9011659885”
Would it make sense to curtail the compensation amounts for these two users? Eg compensating only 80% of amounts over 1 million DAI would yield the following compensation amounts:
“0x909b443761bbD7fbB876Ecde71a37E1433f6af6f”: “3153115.430083132”
“0xB1AdceddB2941033a090dD166a462fe1c2029484”: “1321330.3209327908”
Curtailing compensation for just these two accounts would save 618611.4377539807 DAI, or ~9% of the total compensation amount. Based on the amount of COMP these users have farmed, they would still have made a large profit overall.
The specifics of compensation caps/reductions could be adjusted to other thresholds. But in general, it seems unfair to take reserves from the Compound community and current/future DAI depositors for the benefit of industrial scale farming operations.
Also, sorry to bring this feedback only now, I’ll admin I have not been following the discussions closely and should have commented earlier. Thanks for your work on the compensation scheme!",63,132.4,2021-08-10

['PROPOSAL: Distribute DAI to Users Affected by DAI Liquidations'],"I think that we as a community should make a final decision on this issue now. Almost all the issues addressed last time around are no longer relevant or have been addressed. At this point, I think the only things to consider is the following: was $1.30 the correct market price for Dai, and if not, should the Compound community compensate those effected.
I was strongly against the last proposal as it was trying to compensate users affected by a non-mitigated issue. Now that the oracle was changed and this event cannot happen again, I do think we should consider the proposal. While I don’t think there was a hack, or a mishap in the system, users experienced an unexpected loss. I know of accounts that were safely borrowing at ~70% utilization which were liquidated. These users should be compensated at this point. On the other hand, we have many accounts that were dangerously farming COMP who are probably less deserving of full compensation; however, I think it is a bad idea to start differentiating between different users in this situation. In my mind, its an all or nothing scenario which the community should decide on.",56,146.0,2021-08-12
['PROPOSAL: Distribute DAI to Users Affected by DAI Liquidations'],"Thank you, @monet-supply, for making a Google Sheets with the information.
I think it makes sense for the protocol to acknowledge that users were harmed and that the protocol’s design was flawed at the time. Now that a fix has been implemented, I think it makes sense to reimburse users partially. However, I think larger users should bear some responsibility for not understanding the risks of the protocol. The vast majority of Compound users were unaffected by the incident, and they won’t be receiving any compensation for acting responsibly.
I propose a Reduction Threshold of $100k and a Reduction Ratio of 50%. With those parameters, the protocol would distribute ~$4m.
On a separate note, I would prefer the compensation is paid in COMP rather than DAI. We need to continue to distribute the protocol’s large treasury.",54,85.8,2021-08-16
['PROPOSAL: Distribute DAI to Users Affected by DAI Liquidations'],"@getty I disagree with this logic pretty much in full.
What is the justification to reduce the amount of compensation? In order to save Compound treasury money? That really isn’t appropriate given that the liquidations occurred here as a result of Compound’s inability to use a proper price oracle. Not to mention the fact that this was a very long time ago, and the price of pretty much every single liquidated asset (other than stablecoins) has increased immensely since then.
At a bare minimum the 8% liquidation fee should be repaid to affected users of the protocol. If you want to cap that at some threshold (like what @monet_supply proposed) that seems fair, since those huge wallets are not the average user of the protocol, but other than that this should be a full reimbursement in my opinion.
If it’s being paid in COMP, it should be based on the value of COMP at the time of liquidation (which someone had proposed on the prior thread). I would be in favor of that, as it appropriately reimburses folks for the damages they experienced and the opportunity cost of not having those assets invested during the price run up in early 2021.
And yes in full transparency, I was affected by it. But I was not participating in any risky behavior and was just borrowing DAI against other stables because I didn’t want to pay to swap them at that time. I was NOT levered farming, and there’s zero reason I should have been liquidated. It’s way past the time that this should have been resolved",54,45.8,2021-08-17
['PROPOSAL: Distribute DAI to Users Affected by DAI Liquidations'],"Thanks @kybx86 for the continued effort on this.
We can go back and forth on whether or not code is law, but it’s clear Compound didn’t work as intended. Given the nuance, for this isolated situation, I think it’s reasonable for COMP to compensate users involved in this event.
On the specifics: excited to see compensation coming from the reserves and paid in DAI instead of COMP (this was a key reason PC voted against the original prop). I’m onboard with the logic behind capping the repayment for large-scale farmers and would support this. Though overall, it’s important to remember the total $ amount being distributed here is not super significant in the grand scheme of things.
One nice addition to this would be for us to define (or add more structure around) what situations in the future (if any) would merit reimbursement, and how this reimbursement will occur.",51,115.2,2021-08-17

It seems like we are in agreement to proceed with:

DAI reserves
8% liquidation penalty

It seems like the outstanding items revolve around whether or not there should be manual adjustments to cap compensation for certain wallets.
In my view, governance should be scientific and systematic, not emotional. While I agree with others that there’s a power curve toward the top wallets, I don’t believe we should manually adjust or interfere with the uniformity of the proposal (as @arr00 wrote) or what each of us believes is fair. “Justice is blind”.

One thing to consider is the idea that @tob suggested of basing the compensation on an amount of COMP computed at the time of liquidation is an interesting one as many of the victims lost assets which would have significantly appreciated in the time it has taken to resolve this issue.

['PROPOSAL: Distribute DAI to Users Affected by DAI Liquidations'],"Gauntlet is in agreement that using DAI over COMP sets a good precedent and acts as a strong signal to the broader community. We also intend to model reserve growth to help the community reason better about scenarios such as this.



Dynamic Risk Parameters


Proposal 49 routes a fraction of liquidation incentive from liquidators to the reserves. This change effectively allocates 5.2% of liquidation to liquidators and 2.8% to the reserves, which increases the protocol’s ability to recover from insolvency by growing the backstop liquidity, but reduces the incentive for liquidators. We will update the effective liquidator incentive to 5.2% in the simulation to accommodate the change.
Our current simulation is mainly focused on modeling insolvency risk in one day. Considering the average liquidation size relative to the sizes of reserves, the 2.8% of liquidations added to the reserves in a day will likely not have an immediate impact in such a short time frame. However, tracking the amount of reserves over time and forecasting the growth rate of the reserves due to parameter changes can definitely help community members to better understand the protocol’s liquidity backstop. Forecasting the reserve growth rate is not in our initial scope, but we will evaluate how to support this in Q1 2022.


While a threshold or reduction ratio intuitively make sense the risk of subjectivity is too high.
For those reasons, Gauntlet will be voting FOR CP059.",47,209.2,2021-09-10

The protocol should not encourage behavior that exploited a flaw in the design of COMP rewards.

They bypassed two different user protections built into the protocol interface by (a) recursively borrowing DAI and (b) borrowing well beyond the safe limit.

3.Interested Collateral:
ERC-20 Polygon (MATIC)
4.High-level overview of the project:
MATIC is the ecosystem token of Polygon Network (previously Matic) - a 100% EVM compatible L2 scaling solution with current TVL of more than $6B and 350+ dapps deployed across DeFi, NFT, Gaming and DAO space. With the recent rebranding Polygon has now expanded in scope and vision and have transformed into Polygon with the aim of becoming an Ethereum scaling aggregator - thereby providing developers with L2 solutions in addition to the POS/Plasma chain (mainnet launched April 2020), zk and Optimistic Rollups and Validum chains (part of the roadmap - as seen on website http://polygon.technology/).
5.A brief history of the project:
Matic team has been making valuable contributions to the Ethereum ecosystem for a long time, even before it’s public surfacing as Matic Network. This includes working on implementations of Plasma MVP, developing the WalletConnect protocol and the Ethereum event notification engine Dagger.
MATIC token has now been listed over 30 exchanges globally. In terms of market cap MATIC is valued at $9.5B and FDV of $14.7B (as of 8/28/2021). 24H trading volumes of >$800M make it one of top 30 traded coins across DEXs and CEXs.
Polygon POS/Plasma hybrid chain is a production ready L2 scaling solution that is 100% EVM compatible, decentralized with 88 validators and battle-tested with 200+ dapps building on it. Average txn/day around 200k and 260k+ wallet addresses. These numbers are increasing at a faster rate than competitors owing to the NFT craze and DeFi initiatives launched by dapps on Polygon.

9.The use case for the token:
The MATIC token lies at the heart of the Polygon ecosystem with multiple use-cases. Primarily the MATIC token is used for paying gas fees on the Polygon network. It runs the ecosystem, supporting top Dapps. Additionally you can participate in the Proof-of-Stake consensus of the blockchain as a validator node and earn 12-14% APY in MATIC tokens.
9.1 DeFi use case for the token:
MATIC is also used as collateral for various DeFi protocols including MakerDAO and QiDAO.
10.Where does exchange for the asset occur?
MATIC is one of top traded assets on all CEXs. On-chain pairs are most liquid on Uniswap and Bancor.
11.Oracle Integration:
Chainlink which supports Compound protocol also supports price feed for MATIC
12.Next steps:
We would like the Compound community to consider the application and assess collateral factor, reserve factor, and borrowing limit and put into a formal vote.
For reference, on Maker protocol, minimum collateralization ratio is 175%, stability fee at 3% and debt ceiling at 3 million, but are in discussion to increase to 50 to 100 million.

['Add Market: MATIC'],"Hey Doo,
I’ll look into the Risk Assessment Questions more thoroughly tomorrow.
Risk Assessment Questions:
Moved to a seperate reply.
Addressing your questions:
Collateral Factor:
Collateral factor provides a buffer in which the borrower can be safely liquidated before becoming insolvent. Generally, assets are first added with 0% collateral factor.
Once the asset is added, we can compare MATIC to benchmarks to find the right CF.
Collateral factor should be lower for assets that are more risky for liquidators or Compound to hold. Collateral factor should be lower for assets with large centralized holdings compared to DEX liquidity. Collateral factor can be higher for assets with high DEX liquidity.
We may say MATIC is less risky than USDT (0% CF), but more risky than ETH (75% CF).
MKR (35% CF)
UNI (60% CF)
ZRX (65% CF)
Based on these numbers, MATIC may end up around 35% to 65% CF.
Reserve Factor:
Reserve factor directs some of the interest to insurance for the protocol. Over time, the growing reserves protect the protocol from insolvency. This could be needed if liquidation is too slow. For volatile assets, the standard reserve factor is 25%.
Borrow cap:
Each asset has a borrow cap. Once that much of the asset has been borrowed, no more can be borrowed by anyone.
Borrow cap accomplishes two things:


It limits damage from a vulnerability leading to infinite minting of another collateral asset.


It limits governance sway using borrowed funds.


Borrow cap may not matter until there are greater funds in the market. I’ve heard the Community Multisig has the ability to adjust the borrow caps, so we may not need to address borrow cap right now. Does Polygon use MATIC for governance? If not, we can leave borrow cap unlimited.",32,111.4,2021-09-01

['Add Market: MATIC'],"Risk Assessment Questions:
Q: How much CEX/DEX liquidity is there?
A: Coingecko provides info about liquidity/market depth. There’s much more liquidity across CEXs: ~$25mm -2% liquidity. Coingecko puts UniswapV3 -2% depth at $223k.
Uniswap depth comes from $7.62mm of MATIC liquidity on Uniswap V3.
Q: Which DEX has the most liquidity?
A:

Uniswap and Bancor

Q: How does liquidity compare to the Market Cap?
A:

In terms of market cap MATIC is valued at $9.5B

Q: Can the MATIC token contract be upgraded?
A: No.
Q: Does the collateral token contract have a fixed supply?
A: Yes. MATIC was initialized with the whole 10 Billion supply sent to msg.sender.
Q: Are there any large MATIC holders?

Q: Will existing cToken contracts work with MATIC?
A: Existing cToken contracts should work because MATIC is pretty standard.
The tokens are pausable. This could prevent liquidation if MATIC is added as a collateral asset.
TODO:
Who has the power to pause MATIC?
Under what circumstances will MATIC token be paused?
MATIC token is mostly standard OpenZeppelin contracts. The only new code appears to be the MaticToken constructor.

Q: What security issues were raised in the collateral token’s audit reports?

Are any of these relevant to its use as collateral in Compound?

A:
The Quant Stamp audit focused on Plasma Contracts. I don’t see any issues here about MATIC token.  Nothing in the report seems relevant to its use as collateral in Compound.

Fei Protocol continuously develops both technical and security improvements through a well-defined governance methodology for Fei Improvement Proposals (FIP), which uses the same governance infrastructure as Compound. The same FIP methodology also extends into management of PCV (Protocol Controlled Value) and development of additional use cases and applications.
Why FEI:
FEI is one of the most decentralized and scalable stablecoins in DeFi. As a matter of its monetary policy, Fei Protocol is actively subsidizing and bootstrapping liquidity to its partner protocols with the aim of lowering rates and increasing traffic. The FEI community’s deep commitment has been already evidenced by its supply of 75,000 ETH (~$283 M) and 50m DAI into Compound. The Fei DAO can support FEI markets on Compound by providing FEI liquidity, and has already signaled approval to bootstrap 25-50m worth (Snapshot). Traders would be able to tap into the large FEI-ETH liquidity on Uni V2 ($330 million) as well as any future protocol owned or incentivized liquidity pools.
Following the example of FEI’s listing on other lending protocols; upon listing of $FEI on Compound, the Fei will be committed to introduce a proposal for a liquidity injection of FEI. Fei protocol has already deployed over 20M FEI between Rari, Kashi, and CREAM.
The inclusion of FEI will allow Fei and Compound’s dedicated and robust communities to increase their exposure and utility.

FEI protocol’s IDO was one of the seminal events of Defi this year, plagued with early price fluctuations and liquidity issues. But through robust DAO action and community voting, FEI firmly restored its peg and pursued many integrations that have allowed its ecosystem to flourish.
FEI’s peg has remained steadfast through multiple market downturns, and there is now a reserve stabilizer fund in place to buy back FEI at $0.99. Currently the protocol can redeem all FEI three and a half times over, and with the inclusion of other assets to hedge against an ETH plunge, the risk of continued departure from peg is minimal.

Fei Protocol has been the subject of multiple professional audits by premier firms such as Open Zeppelin and ConsenSys Diligence, and subject to further extensive auditing throughout its security updates.
Fei Protocol also maintains an active bug bounty program which offers up to $1.1M for critical vulnerabilities to the smart contract.

Have there ever been any protocol hacks? If so, when? How were they addressed?


The protocol has never been hacked, but two critical bugs have been reported shortly after the protocol launched via the protocol-sponsored bug bounty program. After identifying and validating the vulnerabilities, the Fei Labs team immediately stopped the affected protocol functionality with the Guardian (held in a multisig by the Fei Core team), which prevented the vulnerabilities from being exploited. No funds were lost.

Engagement and Consultation Request
While expressing our desire to incorporate FEI as a collateral asset on Compound Finance’s platform, the FEI community would also like to solicit suggestion and ideas from the COMP community regarding vital details pertaining to a potential inclusion:

Collateral factor (we are initially applying for a 0% CF)
Reserve factor - 20%
Borrow Cap
Base borrow APY - 0%

(FEI’s interest rate at Rari has flowed beneath 3% with subsidies, averaging ~45% utilization)


% utilization of kink - 80%
APY at kink - 5%

Any comments and insights would be greatly appreciated!

['Add Market: FEI'],"Disclosure: I am an investor in FEI & TRIBE through Robot Ventures.
Historically, stablecoins have been the lifeblood of the Compound protocol, and comprise the majority of borrowing demand (and interest paid to suppliers). I personally believe that adding additional stablecoins that have achieved scale/demand to be the right course, and FEI feels ready.
The primary risk is that (@brianna correct me if I’m wrong) FEI can be infinitely minted by its protocol, bonding curves, and contracts; which poses collateral risk to other users/markets.
Given the fact that stablecoins are often borrowed and supplied to earn interest, not use as collateral, adding them to the protocol without a collateral factor is an easy decision that poses little risk, and has significant benefits.
Questions:

Is there price data availability for FEI on-chain, and via Chainlink?
Given the similarity to DAI as a collateral-backed stablecoin, does it make sense to use DAI’s rate model? Does it warrant deploying a unique rate model?

We can add it with a 0 cf for now, and once we have supply caps and they secure the guardian, I think it can be moved to >0.",25,89.8,2021-09-11
['Add Market: FEI'],"FEI is also burnable by governance, which is somewhat more expansive power than other decentralized stablecoins (eg.

Pause and unpause contracts

Since this proposal follows historical precedents and sets the collateral factor to zero for all markets, I think it should be a straightforward addition to the protocol.

Here is the general flow I am following/doing:


Before the forum post: The proposer really needs to ask themselves if their proposed market is ready to be on Compound and they need to ask themselves if they are willing to fight for it to be listed.


Forum post: It should include a summary/bio of the asset, some info on token distribution, mintability, liquidity/trading stats, why Compound should add it, proposed parameters, and testnet deployment.


Initial community feedback: If the forum post has a warm reception and the testnet deployment is good then launch on mainnet.


Mainnet community feedback: If the mainnet token deployment is done correctly and the community is happy the proposer should make a governance proposal or CAP to add the asset.


After initial listing: The proposer should post a recommendation for a collateral factor (and any other parameters they want to set) and rationale.


Parameter community feedback: Give the community an opportunity to give their input. If a rough consensus is reached then deploy a proposal/CAP for the changes.


As for what default parameters the proposer should use. I recommend finding the most similar asset on the protocol and using that as a starting place. Much of what has been done so far in this proposal is based on the recent cLINK and cCOMP additions.
I think there is a balance between bureaucracy and efficiency. I don’t know what the answer is but I hope to set a good example for the community",65,123.0,2021-07-16

Avg Daily Trade Volume on DEXes
Avg. Volatility (1hr, 6hr, 12hr, Daily, and Weekly)
Mintable?
Economic Concentration (Herfindahl Index? Known Treasury / Founder / VC holdings?)

"['Add Markets: MKR, AAVE, SUSHI, YFI']","Just wanted to state full agreement here about Compound being overdue for an asset listing / risk assessment framework.
For context, Aave’s risk framework (Methodology - Risk) is quite extensive and actively used in discussions on new asset listings and selecting / adjusting collateral ratios. It’s hard to envision any of these new markets being listed and moving off of a zero collateral factor without a similar framework that Compound’s community is aligned on.
Happy to help provide input too, from having been in those discussions within the Aave community. Any community members with risk analysis / actuarial expertise should absolutely jump in too btw, would be a great way to lead and contribute.
Going back to the topic at hand - in support of adding these markets @getty and IMO given that they’re being added at 0% collateral factor, OK to move forward. I don’t see a big risk of setting precedent here, since it seems like there’s enough interest to start on codifying an asset listing framework shortly.

Introduction to Atlantis World

aaa1765×1484 280 KB

Atlantis World is a pixel metaverse with token-gating, video calling, gamified DeFi + in-game DAO voting. We believe that as much as metaverse should be open, it should be accessible (lightweight) + plug into DeFi applications in a fun / gamified way.
Existing virtual worlds are inaccessible because they have a 3d/immersive focus, resulting in a high-cost barrier to entry (since in order to enjoy seamless loading experience, users must go out + buy the latest iPad / gaming pc, this technology / hardware is neither inexpensive or readily available globally).
Also, we believe that we are missing a huge onboarding opportunity into DeFi as a collective space by not gamifying leading dApps / protocols inside of virtual worlds with additional interactive learning modules.
We are adding video/audio calling capabilities to user-owned, token-gated spaces inside of our pixel metaverse for communities to interact with each other; whilst gamifying DeFi protocols like Aave / Yearn / Sushi, curating interactive learning modules in our Web3 Academy + gamifying DAO voting.
To provide further value to the space, we’re exploring adding tooling products like CoinGecko to the Atlantis experience, as well as transforming our favourite NFT avatars into versatile, hyper-composable playable characters by building open source sprite sheets + full walk cycles ready to be used by those communities not just in Atlantis, but in all of pixel metaverse.
We’re also building public spaces + rethinking decentralized governance in collaboration with our community. We plan to build the City of Atlantis → ​​a buzzing, entrepreneurial capital owned / governed by its users / inhabitants, where ETH is money + creative culture is king. If users want to open a business, like a virtual cafe, music venue, movie theatre or an independent art exhibition, they’ll be able to apply to occupy land for free to do something creative.
Adding value to the COMP ecosystem
We can provide long term value to the Compound ecosystem in a number of ways.

Integrating Compound Protocol inside of Atlantis (i.e. users will access Compound within the DeCentral Bank building all across Atlantis World).
Building fully Web3-enabled token gated space for the COMP holders community with NFTs, video calling, DeFi + in-game DAO voting! The space will be map sized and totally personalized with Compound brand assets.
Creating interactive learning modules centred on Compound to onboard new users into DeFi.
Enabling network effects by rolling out gamified Compound products in our public spaces and spaces of other DeFi communities such as Yearn to onboard more users who are already Web3 native.
Adding a portal to comp.xyz, a Compound booth (where users can learn more) and Compound building to Atlantis City.
Airdropping token gated space to the COMP community.
Compound wearables + in-metaverse branded items inside of Atlantis World.
Compound (core) contributors token-gated (NFT/POAP/social token etc) co-working space.
Other suggestions from COMP contributors / community.

Additional support requests
We’d highly appreciate some support on our mission to collaborate and provide value to the COMP ecosystem / community:

Grant funding;
Mentorship;
Tech support;
Community / user feedback and collaborative efforts;
Joint marketing.

['Compound & Vesper: Compound Island'],"Hi everyone! My name is Matt Lam and I head up operations with Vesper Finance. We wanted to share a proposal for a joint grant / bounty ($100K worth of COMP contributed for grant).
Would love to hear the community’s input!

Summary: A Better Partnership Lending Model (“happy forks”)
The problem:  Today’s DeFi lending market is challenging for new tokens.  On one hand, seasoned tokens may approach Compound via its risk adjusting process, and become available to users for supplying, borrowing, and collateralizing.  The best paths for the “other 99.9%” of tokens is either forking Compound, or using innovative new isolated-lending-pairs at Sushi(Kashi) or Ruler.  These alternatives do not provide tokens with a robust collateralization ability in a reasonable time-to-market timeframe.
Our proposed solution:   Deploy and demonstrate a software template for Compound partnerships which deploys a fork of the Compound codebase that is (1) economically linked to COMP, yet (2) risk-sandboxed such that risky tokens do not transfer negative impact back to the core Compound lending platform.
Looking for a Compound-knowledgeable engineer or group who can deploy the Compound smart contracts + write a wrapper contract as described below.
Outcome:  A true Vesper/Compound partnership, the DeFi Way:  through composable smart contracts.

Purpose
Decentralized Finance is a groundbreaking industry that enables users to leverage their capital in ways not accessible to them under the TradFi framework. Vesper recognizes the immediate and long-term impact of DeFi, and offers an easy-to-use, hands-free experience that anyone can use for exposure to DeFi.
Today, Vesper operates as a yield meta-aggregator for top crypto assets (ETH, USDC, WBTC, LINK, DAI, USDT, UNI). Users can deposit these assets to Vesper and enjoy auto-compounding returns as their funds are routed to the best yield opportunities in the space.
Several Vesper Pools take advantage of strategies that route through Compound. Vesper Island is a friendly Compound fork, intended to be a new DeFi primitive under the Vesper banner that creates a broader selection of tokens that can be utilized in peer-to-peer lending.
Vesper Island adheres to the same standards as the flagship Compound market: a permissionless, peer-to-peer lending platform protected by over-collateralization of positions and automated liquidations on underwater borrowers.
The successful launch of Vesper Island enables Vesper to support more ERC20 tokens through integration into the lending platform with a faster time-to-market. This is particularly worthwhile for tokens that otherwise are not integrated into major DeFi platforms and therefore are unable to generate meaningful yield.
For Compound, this proposal provides an innovative new model for Compound partnerships.  It creates a new market and incorporates a new audience under the Compound umbrella that will contribute TVL and generate revenue for the Compound ecosystem.
Additionally, this notion of a Compound “satellite” lending market can introduce a new set of products, with other projects like Vesper creating their own markets. This is a highly scalable model that could translate to sustained TVL growth and consistent revenue gains for Compound as more and more independent communities seek to build out their own “authorized” spinoffs of the flagship lending market.
Vesper Island utilizes a fork of the Compound lending contracts governed by vVSP holders. As this product is positioned firmly within the Vesper ecosystem, it’s important that it is owned and operated by community members who make up said ecosystem (a la vVSP). This is advantageous for COMP holders too: they reap the rewards of an additional market without taking on the burden of managing said market.
tl;dr Vesper Island = Compound fork, governed by VVSP, with a special wrapper that deposits Compound-listed assets on the Compound platform.

Framework


Scope




Target
Type




https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol
Smart Contract


https://app.compound.finance/
Demonstration  Front End




Scope: Smart Contracts
User story:   As with Compound, Vesper Island (“VI”) users may supply, borrow and collateralize based on a list of whitelisted assets.  Beginning list:  Compound list (see “wrapper”, below) + VSP, VVSP, VUSD, and other Vesper pool tokens.
User story:   Liquidations may occur, per familiar liq rules.
User story:   Price oracles may be Compound open oracles or TWAP on-chain price oracles.
User story:   Governance via the VVSP token (0xbA4cFE5741b357FA371b506e5db0774aBFeCf8Fc).
User story:  For assets listed on Compound, supply and borrow occur as shown in the Framework graphic, utilizing a wrapper.
Compound’s primary product encompasses their on-chain, peer-to-peer lending market. The market enables users to permissionlessly post assets and take loans via over-collateralization of other crypto-assets (IE: Post 200 USDC and receive $100 worth of $ETH). When loans go underwater (ie: ETH doubles in value) the collateral is liquidated on-chain, ensuring that the lender is never at risk of losing their capital.
The protocol is governed by COMP tokens. Token holders can vote to incorporate new assets, removing existing, and modify lending terms (revenue draw, minimum collateral requirements, etc.).
Vesper Island will fork the protocol and, targets the following deliverables from the grantee:

Author, test and deploy a c-token wrapper.  See Framework graphic, above.
Deployment of Compound lending platform and governance module, per above user stories.
Demonstration UI


Scope: Demonstration UI
It is assumed that the Vesper team will develop a fully branded and integrated UI, separate from this bounty.
For this bounty, the goal and requirement is a minimum UI that sufficiently demonstrates the smart contract deployment is working for basic lending functions.   Liquidations UI and governance UI are nice-to-have but not required for visually demonstrating that Vesper Island is working.  Vesper DAO will host and operate this as a beta-test UI until Vesper’s UI is available.

Grantee Qualifications and Rewards
This is a binary, all-or-nothing bounty for the full purse to the first individual or group who successfully provides all aspects of the bounty required.
The ideal candidate or group has experience with Solidity, Ethereum smart contract deployment, the Compound lending & governance smart contracts, deployment of the Compound smart contract complex, and a web UI that interacts with the Compound lending & governance smart contracts.
Amount of bounty: $100,000 COMP + $100,000 VSP - $20,000 deployment audit = US$180,000 total bounty. The COMP & VSP token amounts are fixed at the time of the COMP grant allocation.
Deliverables:

C-token wrapper that produces the outcome illustrated in the graphic, economically connecting Vesper Island to Compound by tunnelling supply & borrow.
Deployment of “Vesper Island”: A full, fresh and separate deployment of the Compound lending platform, including c-token wrapper, governed by the VVSP ERC20 token.
A temporary demonstration UI sufficient to demonstrate the live-mainnet deployment of Vesper Island.

Vesper will fund and provide external source code and deployment audits, in part using $20,000 of the $100k COMP grant.",43,2208.4,2021-09-09

['Compound & Vesper: Compound Island'],A flow diagram would be really useful.,18,18.4,2021-09-14
['Compound & Vesper: Compound Island'],"Been thinking about this proposal, will keep my thoughts brief:

The outlined mechanics of Compound Island (vVSP managed pool that funnels capital into Compound) can be achieved with Fuse and having a plugin to redirect unused capital into Compound. The plugin mechanism is being reviewed by Quantstamp now and should be live in the coming weeks. Additionally, the pool administrator can easily be switched to governance by vVSP holders.
This in no way contributes value to the Compound protocol anymore than the plugin mechanism offered by the Fuse platform despite the rather alrge grant.
Vesper has had a pool on the Fuse platform for a long time now.

While I am overall really excited about the growth of lending platforms and want to see more creative platforms, when I see this, I unfortunately don’t see anything new (though I could be wrong, all ears if I am).
Compound Governance should be focused on deploying capital into new, creative, exciting solutions - not just a rebrand of Fuse.",18,53.4,2021-09-14

['FRAX Listing Proposal'],"I am proposing adding FRAX to Compound.  I’m a member of the Frax community.  I’m hoping to gather feedback, especially around proposed parameters.  FRAX’s capital efficiency and lending AMO should make FRAX the least expensive stablecoin to borrow on Compound.  As time passes and FRAX proves itself as a useful asset on Compound, I hope FRAX will gradually be treated more like a fully collateralized fiat stablecoin on Compound.
Summary
FRAX is a redeemable stablecoin with a dynamic collateral ratio that adjusts based on market demand. Frax is unique among recent stablecoin designs in that each FRAX is always redeemable for $1.00 worth of assets from the Frax protocol. This has kept the price of FRAX in a relatively tight band around $1.00, making Frax an ideal asset to borrow and lend against on Compound. Frax is already integrating with Compound and is currently the 17th largest cUSDC holder (~$30m) and growing, demonstrating a strong synergy between the communities.  As the FRAX supply increases, additional collateral will be deposited into Compound.  The Frax community has also chosen to hold all COMP rewards received to be an active participant in Compound governance.
v2 of the Frax protocol recently launched and introduces a lending module that can be built directly into Compound. This would enable the Frax protocol to supply large amounts of FRAX to Compound on demand. FRAX could become the lowest borrowing cost stablecoin on Compound, which would be quite attractive for Compound borrowers.  The first step towards this integration is the addition of FRAX as an asset on Compound.
FRAX Stability
Since launching in December 2020, FRAX has held a tight band around the $1.00 price target.  Below is a chart showing FRAX price history since launch:

Each FRAX is collateralized by approximately $0.86 USDC (including interest bearing equivalents) and $0.14 of the Frax governance token, FXS. When the price of FRAX is at or above $1.00, the protocol gradually lowers the collateralization ratio of USDC to FXS. When the price of FRAX is below $1.00, the protocol gradually increases the ratio. FRAX can always be minted or redeemed by the protocol for $1.00 of assets, which counterbalances significant price deviations from the $1.00 target. Frax emphasizes a highly autonomous approach with no active management of the price stability function.  More information about the mechanisms behind FRAX can be found in the links below.
FRAX is not an algorithmic stablecoin.  There are algorithmic aspects of FRAX (the protocol uses FXS as a tool to stabilize the price of FRAX) but it is better understood as a capital efficient collateralized stablecoin.  Given that the Compound collateral factor of FRAX is likely to be well below the current collateralization ratio of 86.5%, FRAX as a collateral asset on Compound would effectively be over collateralized by a healthy margin.  It is also worth noting that there is also approximately $60m of Uniswap, Sushiswap and FRAX-3Pool LP tokens locked within the Frax protocol. A significant portion of this is locked for greater than 2 years. This provides guaranteed liquidity for FRAX and provides significant benefits to the stability of the protocol in times of volatility.
Lending AMO
Frax has built a lending contract (AMO) that will integrate the Frax protocol directly into Compound to supply FRAX on demand for borrowing.  This would be somewhat analogous to the Fed discount window, where borrowers could borrow directly from the FRAX protocol via Compoound. A direct integration with Compound will also make supplying FRAX more attractive to other market participants because there is a guarantee of FRAX liquidity directly from the protocol, avoiding the pitfalls of high utilization rates in DeFi money markets.
Misc. Project Info
There is approximately $102m of FRAX liquidity currently on Uniswap.  The main venue for FRAX is slowly shifting to a Curve FRAX-3pool; the stableswap curve is so much more capital efficient at holding the $1.00 price target.  FRAX volume was averaging about $9m volume in March - Coingecko is currently under reporting the volume as it does not include the Curve pool or Sushiswap.  Given that FRAX can always be minted and redeemed at the protocol, daily volume is less of a factor in my opinion.  Frax has undergone extensive code reviews and was audited by Certik with additional audits upcoming.
Input on Proposed Parameters
I’ve spoken with the Frax team and they are happy to help any with oracle / contract deployment needs.  I’d appreciate some Compound community input on the Collateral Factor and Reserve Factor. Given that each FRAX is backed by approximately $0.865 of USDC, cUSDC, aUSDC and yUSDC (obviously on chain), it would make sense to me that FRAX’s Collateral Factor and Reserve Factor would look more like DAI than USDT - perhaps a CF of 60% and RF of 15% to start.  I also understand if a more conservative approach is desired as things get off the ground - please let me know what you think!
Thank you for your time and participation.  Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  As I receive input, I’m happy to revise the proposal to incorporate it.  Reference links are below.

['FRAX Listing Proposal'],"Thanks for creating this proposal here @metalface. Really important for FRAX to get on Compound as we are the most capital efficient stablecoin on the market. As everyone can see, our peg is perfect and rock solid just like DAI, USDC, etc. I’m also confident that due to the capital efficient design of FRAX, it will be the cheapest/most affordable stablecoin to borrow which would increase Compound usage by a lot.
Additionally, it’s important to note that the Frax Protocol itself is one of the largest lenders on Compound with its idle collateral. So there’s incredible synergy here. Frax Protocol lends over $30m on Compound to earn yield with its unused collateral. We also earn COMP tokens for this lending that we have never sold and do not plan to sell. We want to be an active part of Compound governance as important players in the DeFi space.

I also want to update on our progress. Since this proposal was created, FRAX has not just grown but has thrived, becoming the premier decentralized stablecoin that has successfully developed new algorithmic stability mechanisms. We’ve never broken our peg in over 7 months of operation now. Market data is on our side.

['Punitive accounting for borrow and redeem'],"As the community lists more types of collateral tokens, the risks to the protocol also increases. There are known issues, such as listing a token which has the ability to ‘infinimint’ itself, which inherently poses a danger to the protocol. Other risks come from adding tokens which are not inherently malicious but follow standards outside of ERC-20 which the current Compound Protocol was not necessarily designed for.
The recent attack on CREAM falls into the latter category. We at Compound Labs are recommending making a change along these lines to mitigate such attacks, in a world in which the protocol is adding more diverse sets of tokens.
The proposed change builds upon a community PR to move the accounting for borrowing to update before a transferOut is called, which we call Punitive Accounting. We add punitive accounting to redeem as well, and note that the rest of the protocol already operates according to this concept.
Individual cTokens currently protect themselves from any kind of reentrancy on an individual market basis. It is possible to add reentrancy to the whole protocol (through the Comptroller), though it would be more expensive than the current checks. Some amount of internal reentrancy is needed by the protocol in order to perform liquidations, so there is some added complexity for this type of protection.
With the proposed punitive accounting changes, it may now instead be possible to remove the reentrancy checks altogether. To do that, the community should prove to itself that the protocol is now safe to reentrancy attacks altogether. That can be done as an independent later step, after more thorough evaluation.",17,113.4,2021-09-10

Would love to know what people think as to upgradability, multisig control, or L2 governance (not necessarily now but what can we come up with?)
The biggest benefit to holders of having COMP on L2 is that it’s going to be making the token relatively scarcer on ethereum and on exchanges, and it’s also making the whole system cheaper and more accessible to small holders of the token. It will also seed the way for being able to lock COMP into our L2 Starports

['Should we lower the proposal threshold?'],"Currently it takes 65K COMP to submit a proposal. This means currently only 13 addresses can submit a proposal.
While work is currently being done to increase this number by creating a whitelist  which would be controlled by the community multisig, we should also be working to empower the wider community that already exists: Compound | Leaderboard
Lowering the Proposal threshold to:

50K would increase potential proposers to 22
10K would increase potential proposers to 39
4k (1% of Quorum.) to 52

Personally I think we should lower it to at least 10K as this could incentivize whales, with multiples of that, to delegate to multiple proposers. And empowering more people with the ability to create a proposal, should lead to more people thinking about what they can do with their new found power.
Note: Lowering the threshold will also speed up the Compound Autonomous Proposal(CAP) process. Which also has a pretty high barrier of requiring 100 COMP ($40k) at the initiators address. Should this be lowered as well?
It might also be helpful to create an RFP for a mechanism to more easily allow for a single address to delegate to an array of addresses instead of having to transfer tokens out.

Potential Dangers:


Spamming the UI: this doesn’t seem like a real threat when 10K COMP = $40M, and most everyone with 10K+ is identifiable. Personally, I think the risk of some graffiti is worth empowering more folks. You can’t have democracy without the occasional Vermin Supreme. And if it ends up being an issue, we should tackle it independently.


Borrowing to submit a proposal: There is a borrowing cap on the Compound CAP market, but there’s not one on the CREAM Comp market. Which currently has 370 available to borrow and ~1000 supplied in total. Which is far less than whats being suggested. If the borrow CAP was removed this could pose a risk, but that risk is at 65k, and it seems like the problem here is that the COMP borrow rate is artificially low(re: positive) due to rewards mining. Which @TylerEther is working on a fix for.



What Should the Proposal Threshold be?

['Should we lower the proposal threshold?'],Agree that proposal threshold isn’t as much of a barrier but what about quorum @rleshner ?

['Should we lower the proposal threshold?'],"Yeah, I’m familiar with that thread, there was general support(70%) for 50K, which is why one of the options here is 50k.
If 65K or the CAP was sufficiently low, we wouldn’t have the need or support for creating a whitelist of proposers that bypasses the 65K parameter and the CAP process. → Whitelist of addresses that can create proposals
To put more color on the current threshold, these are the groups who are left out from submitting by not lowering it to at least 50k (one of whom is even on the community multisig). Going down to 10K it’s also all pretty well known delegates.

There’s little risk to allowing more people the ability to make proposals, especially with the gas cost of even simple proposals and the review period in place. So I think the question is why shouldn’t we empower more people? Worse case no new active participants, best case it gets more people thinking about how to use their new found powers.
Also with the CAP, only 70* voting addresses have >100 votes, with most comp being delegated or just being held by speculators. So there really aren’t many people who a)have $45k comp lying around b)know how to submit proposals c)actively participate in comp governance.
@joeysantoro There’s been no issue with proposals reaching quorum, and there’s a whole host of risks that come with a lower quorum. It’s already a $200M quorum in control of $10B in assets. Plus the quorum as percent of circulating supply is getting lowered every day.",24,19.8,2021-08-21
['Should we lower the proposal threshold?'],"I’m in favor of creating multiple timelocks, each with different parameters and powers.
Are all proposals equal in the risks they present? For example, does upgrading the Comptroller have the same level of risk as changing COMP speeds? What about creating a temperature check proposal? All have different levels of risk.
We don’t want governance to slow down our innovation speed or the speed at which we update market parameters as markets shift, but at the same time, governance protects the protocol from possible risks.
The current governance system assumes the risks of all proposals are equal, which is not the case. This can be problematic for both low-risk and high-risk proposals.
What if the current review period should be increased to account for how complex major upgrades to the protocol can be? All other proposals will have to slow down.
What if we wanted to adjust interest rates and COMP speeds on a weekly basis? 2 days to review the proposal and 2 days for voting leaves only 3 days to evaluate the performance of the changes before submitting the next rate adjustment proposal.
Sure, multisigs can and are currently being used for special purposes, but this leads to centralization and potentially less transparency and discussion. Although I believe there may be some use-cases where multisigs are the better option over governance proposals, I think the use of multiple timelocks will significantly improve Compound’s governance overall.",21,24.2,2021-08-22

['New Market Addition: Gemini dollar (GUSD)'],"Hi everyone in the Compound community!
In recent months, we’ve been boosting the Gemini dollar (GUSD) presence in the DeFi ecosystem. We think being part of Compound would be a valuable addition to the protocol and a great next step for the GUSD.
Gemini dollar
Gemini Trust Company, LLC is a U.S. company regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services. Gemini dollar (GUSD) bank reserves are eligible for FDIC insurance up to $250,000 per user while custodied with State Street Bank and Trust. USD reserve audits are published monthly by an independent registered accounting firm, BPM LLP. The GUSDEthereum smart contract was launched in September 2018 and has been audited by Trail of Bits. There are no fees to create or redeem GUSD through Gemini and Gemini currently covers all gas costs to withdraw on-chain.
DeFi Ecosystem
GUSD is one of the first fiat-backed stablecoins on Ethereum with approximately $210mm in float. The GUSD Aave market size is $30mm, the GUSD Curve pool has $30mm locked, and there’s more than $7mm locked in our Yearn vault. GUSD is also tradeable on Uniswap and is active as Vault collateral on Maker. Gemini users have been able to trade COMP since September 2020.
Benefits
GUSD can always be created and redeemed with USD 1:1 on Gemini. As one of the most popular exchanges and fiat on-ramps, we think our users would find Compound’s interest rate markets attractive and bring further growth to the protocol. We also believe Compound and the general DeFi ecosystem can benefit from diversifying exposure to different centralized stablecoins by including trusted, highly regulated issuers like Gemini.
In addition, we are increasingly exploring strategies that can augment Gemini’s value-add to DeFi and support for the ecosystem. These include thinking about possible product integrations and having active relationships with regulators to figure out the friction points and possible solutions that can help us best collaborate with teams like Compound Labs. GUSD could act as a natural gateway asset for these future plans and facilitate possible integrations and support for Compound.
Proposal
We propose including a GUSD market with an initial collateral factor of 0% to start with.
Later on, we’d love to have conversations with the Compound community about increasing the collateral factor and adding COMP distribution for the market.

['New Market Addition: Gemini dollar (GUSD)'],"Thanks for the concise and well-documented summary, Tyler! I think that Gemini’s compliance-first approach is likely to resonate well with the Compound community.
I think that with respect to the Compound protocol, GUSD occupies an unusual place in the stablecoin market today. On the one hand, it is one of the most highly regulated stablecoins and enjoys liquidity on most major DeFi platforms, as highlighted by Tyler. However, as of today, it would be the lowest market cap stablecoin on Compound (by about a factor of 5) if adopted.
I am in favor of adding GUSD in principle on the grounds that the protocol should endeavor to support high-quality stable assets with adequate liquidity, even if they are not the stablecoin-du-jour.
I think it would be helpful if Tyler or another Gemini team member could offer a brief, high-level overview of the protections in GUSD’s PrintLimiter.sol and LockRequestable.sol contracts.

The PrintLimiter contract governs increases to the token supply. The basic logic to increase the token is contained within ERC20Impl. PrintLimiter enforces a balance of ‘online’ and ‘offline’ control of the token supply for Gemini.

That limitedPrinter account is in our online key infrastructure so that we have low latency control over the token supply, but within the bounds of the ceiling.
That ceiling is controlled by the Custodian of the PrintLimiter (print custodian). This contract enforces multi-sig control, where in our instance, the keys in that multi-sig arrangement are in offline key infrastructure. To raise the ceiling, we must sign a transaction with a quorum of offline keys.

['A Compound Paladin Voting Market'],"Hey everyone, Figue from Paladin
We’re excited to share what we’ve been working on and how it can contribute to your governance. At its heart the Paladin protocol aims to enhance governance interactions with voting markets, coordination mechanisms and more.
While the topic of vote lending and liquid influence is controversial, we believe that built correctly and in tandem with the community, the right guardrails can be defined to ensure healthier governance. In this discussion we want to elaborate on why we took the approach we did, how it can help persistent shortcomings in governance and how you can contribute to it all.
Let’s be clear, vote borrowing is nothing new, today’s lending protocols already enable it. Anyone with enough capital can collateralize assets and borrow governance tokens. But this only enables whales and is very rough around the edges.
Paladin Lending aims to fill the gap by providing a dedicated lending protocol to manage influence in governance. We want to create a win-win solution between investors and activists for more effective coordination : creating utility for passive non-voters and granting new tools for activists.
If you’re interested in learning more about the Paladin vision and architecture check out our articles: Manifesto for a new wave of corporate activism, Paladin, the governance lending platform, Voting Markets: Why now.
TLDR - Why a voting market :
DAOs are rooted in a vision of openness and low barriers so all kinds of individuals can work together in full transparency. This protocol has thousands of different tokenholders yet when you look at the voting record it’s heavily skewed toward a few participants. This is for a lot of reasons: protocols are still distributing ownership, high gas fees, information overload, passive investors, etc. A class of delegates is emerging but it’s still questionable how effective this will be. Overall the result is a lot of idle governance power and centralization risk.
Our bet is that voting markets can make this influence liquid and separate passive investors from players who are really interested in participating.
Evolving together :
During our stealth development we’ve connected with a lot of delegates, active voters and core teams to tailor the protocol to their needs. Feedback is a crucial part of our process and we’ll continue to work closely with communities integrated into Paladin. That way lending markets can better reflect each culture.
In its current design, staking pools can be customized in terms of access (whitelisting delegates, need for minimum “skin in the game”…) or through its interest model.
NB : the current pricing models are a bonding curve with Utilization Rate of the pool and Quorum / Proposal threshold as parameters. In the current design, the loan cost discourages huge borrows for long periods and reduces potential GEV on large loans.
Paladin will be live on main net mid August and we wanted to use this post as a greeting and an invitation to collaborate.
By creating a community designed pool, the Compound community can enable liquid governance on its terms.
There will be an upcoming community call 13th of September at 18:00 CET in our discord, to clarify everything that needs more explanation. If you can join us we’d love to hear from you. If not, feel free to share your thoughts in this discussion and we’ll answer any questions.",18,98.6,2021-09-02
['Compensation Proposal: Distribute COMP to Affected Users in the DAI Liquidations'],"
Note: I’ve deployed the CAP for this proposal . If you support this, you can delegate to this address: 0x2f04664b18fb9b6d49124fcc876b52a4ba797718

Objectives:
Following the first proposal to increase the DAI reserve factor with the goal of de-risking the DAI market and mitigating against future improper liquidations, this next step outlines the mechanics to compensate users for funds lost in the liquidation events of 11/26 by distributing 55,255 COMP (0.55% of total COMP supply) to affected users.
Background:
COMP distribution to users began on June 15, 2020, and has since distributed ~450K COMP, with approximately 4MM COMP remaining.
Behind the scenes, the distribution works through two main contracts, the Reservoir, and the ‘Comptroller’. The Reservoir is an immutable contract that exists outside the control of governance and drips 0.50 COMP per block into the Comptroller contract. The Reservoir continuously adds COMP at the drip rate and is independent of the rate at which the Comptroller distributes such COMP. The Comptroller contract controls the usage and distribution rate of COMP for a number of functions including but not limited to, i) distribution to borrowers and lenders for each market, ii) building a reserve that can be used for community needs, and iii) voting, among other uses.
Currently, the Comptroller distributes 0.352 COMP/block (70%) on liquidity incentives and accrues the remaining 0.148 COMP/block (30%) as treasury reserves. At the current COMP price of ~$155, Compound’s treasury is growing at a rate of ~$149,000 per day, or $4.5MM per month.
Gauntlet’s prop30 added the ability for the Comptroller contract to send COMP to a particular user, group, address, or contract selected by a governance vote. These changes as described by @jmo, enable a plethora of use cases, including the use of treasury assets to compensate those liquidated in the Thanksgiving Event, as suggested by @mrhen .
Mechanics:
This proposal uses the _grantComp function introduced by Gauntlet to distribute a set quantity of COMP to a Merkle distributor contract that will automatically distribute the corresponding COMP to each of the wallets affected—user’s don’t need to interact with any contract to claim this COMP; After the proposal’s execution, the relayer will claim COMP for each wallet according to the merkle distributor and distribute it.
To calculate the amount of COMP needed from the Comptroller for the compensation, this proposal uses the 14-day average closing price of COMP from CoinMarketCap as of the time of writing (12/8/20) to compensate users 8% of the liquidated amount.
As an illustrative example, if a wallet had 100 DAI repaid by a liquidator, then that wallet would receive 8 DAI worth of COMP, which equates to 0.064 COMP of compensation (assuming a 14-day average COMP price of $123.39).
Distributor Methodology
Referencing the DAI liquidations spreadsheet published by @rleshner, a total of 85,220,406.43 DAI was repaid on 11/26/20. Applying the 8% liquidation penalty, this proposal would pay out a total of 6,817,632.51 DAI (in COMP). Taking the 6,817,632.51 DAI and dividing by $123.39 (the 14-day average price of COMP) equals 55,254.95 COMP distributed to users. Numbers here:
Screen Shot 2020-12-09 at 08.30.591598×812 68.1 KB

To preview the COMP distribution per address, see here.

Overall, this distribution of COMP represents only 0.55% of the fully diluted COMP 10M supply and less than 2% of the 24hr COMP volume traded globally, suggesting minimal market impact. Additionally, assuming the Comptroller earns 962 COMP per day, the 55k COMP distribution will be replenished in less than 60 days.
I propose proceeding with this approach for the following reasons:


Compensate users who lost funds: This proposal achieves the objective of compensating users who lost funds due to the abnormal DAI price action that took place on Coinbase, which reflected an off-mark DAI price relative to the other exchanges and liquidity venues, as noted by members of the community.



Restore borrower confidence: Based on forum discussions, it seems that the community believes that the liquidations were not in the spirit of how the Compound protocol should have affected users given the off-mark price of DAI. Community members and borrowers have expressed their frustration in the forums and suggested compensation.


Achievable: While the community acknowledges that the exact dollar value impact of the liquidation event varies per user, with feedback from core Compound contributors, this approach executes an achievable, straightforward, and timely compensation resolution rather than constructing an overly complex approach that would look to compensate an exact amount. This proposal is a Pareto optimal solution.


Parameter choice: The 14-day average price is a middle ground between the COMP price of 2 weeks ago and the current spot prices. Backdating a price too long, and it gives affected users COMP at an unfair discount relative to the current spot prices. Too recent could lead to material differences by the time the proposal goes live after the CAP, voting, and queuing period.


Relatively small distribution: This proposal would not inflate the COMP supply and simply allocates existing COMP in the Comptroller to affected users, as noted by @rleshner. The distribution represents a very small % of the total COMP supply (0.55%).

But there is one nuance I would like to point out.
The only compensation mentioned was 8% fee for the liquidation of positions.
But it’s just a commission, and the larger problem was that Coinbase Oracle was attacked, and Security was exchanged to DAI for the unfair, non-market price.
People lost not these 8%, but rather much larger sums because of the exchange rate difference.
In order to evaluate real damages we might consider so-called DAI rate deviation margin - and apply it to whole sum of DAI paid out by the liquidators.
For instance, average DAI exchange rate this month was about 1.04$
Max DAI exchange rate during the attack 1.23$
so, roughly speaking, the rate deviated for about 18% from the monthly average.

Referencing the DAI liquidations spreadsheet published by rleshner, a total of 85,220,406.43

I think we should add another 15339673,08 (18%) to the sum above, and use it as a final sum for compensation calculation.
If it seems too complex, we can round the sum to 100M (85M + 15M), and dispense 8% out of the total 100M between the damaged parties.
It is just a concept; if the approval for such scheme would be granted, we will have to make precise calculation, but I think you get the idea above.",97,129.4,2020-12-10
['Compensation Proposal: Distribute COMP to Affected Users in the DAI Liquidations'],"@zino @Dmitry: You are correct. The community has acknowledged that losses varied per user based on a number of factors such as prices, liquidation timing, and collateral type. The losses incurred by users varied between 8% to 30% depending on the factors above.
I think it’s important to zoom out and acknowledge a few points:

Compensation is an act of good gesture by the Compound community and its stakeholders to restore borrower confidence and acknowledge the liquidations affected users in an adverse and unintended manner.
Some have argued that users affected should not be fully compensated and that instead, they should get less than the 8%, or get 80c on the dollar, or such.
Considering the complexities of precisely calculating the exact losses per user, this proposal takes what’s known–the 8% liquidation penalty–and seeks, in good faith, to compensate users based on an achievable approach.
The actual compensation percent is ultimately a function of COMP price. If COMP price is greater than the twap price used to calculate the COMP taken from the controller, users will be marginally better off than 8%. Conversely, if COMP price is less than the twap price, users will be marginally worse off than 8%. The point being here being, that due to the delays and timelocks of the Compound Governance contract, it’s not achievable to get users an exact percentage compensation either way.

The code that executes this proposal has taken time to develop and would take several more weeks to go back and re-develop the code to incorporate new logic. In situations such as this one, community action and self-organizing play a crucial role in effectuating this proposal. A practical course of action is important before the Thanksgiving liquidation events and the frustration by the community becomes stale.
The deployed and currently live autonomous proposal (CAP) has a real shot at compensating users.

The total that should have been paid off is 85M paid out by liquidators plus 15M of exchange rates difference. But there’s just no reason to treat it as a base for 8% compensation. We have to add two things:

8% liquidators fee collected on 85M paid out; and
exchange rate difference calculated as I suggested before (DAI monthly average to max known Compound Oracle closing exchange rate), for the sake of the conversation let’s assume it in the range of 18%.

In this case total compensation should be about 26% (8+18) out of 85M. Basically, the figure mentioned in p. 2 and its calculation should be the topic of discussion. I would add the percentage of the exchange rates nevertheless, at least partly (maybe not in full, but at least 50% of it).

It is also not completely impossible that lenders will get screwed in some different way one day. If this doesn’t get addressed it actually is setting a bad precedent.

['Compensation Proposal: Distribute COMP to Affected Users in the DAI Liquidations'],"@jared thanks for your thoughts. They are well taken. I acknowledge that the Compound protocol is not perfect today and that further steps are needed to improve its security and mechanics. Oracles (or more generally price feeds) have been one of the toughest problems to solve in finance and DeFi. Price perfection in real-time is a difficult thing to achieve particularly when markets move quickly. An oracle needs to simultaneously recognize the real-time price while also rejecting real-time prices that don’t reflect the true price–in some fashion, oracles remind me of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle in physics: the more closely you measure its position the more uncertain its velocity, and vice-versa. Price feeds suffer a similar curse: too fast and you can intake the wrong price; too slow and it quotes a stale price, creating a trade-off between speed and accuracy. Traditional financial markets have usually solved this problem through human reasoning (i.e. “the price is off”) or litigation (i.e. “you improperly liquidated me, so I’m going to sue”). These dynamics don’t exist on-chain yet. But I am of the mind that steps can be taken to improve the design of oracles AND liquidation mechanics. The UMA protocol is a great example of this, where liquidations go through an on-chain dispute process that allows members to vote on the validity and accuracy of a liquidation. (UMA is particularly interesting in this regard because it’s “priceless”, so there are no oracles at all).
As you know best, the Compound protocol and design have taken +2 years to develop and have benefited from user feedback and community use. Designing the perfect oracle and liquidation solution will take time, and require feedback from the community.
To that end, I am cognizant of the existing risks of the protocol and I think my first proposal around increasing the reserve factors across the DAI market (and others) is a strong first step in de-risking the protocol. Of note, I think you’ll see many DAI liquidity miners wind down their leverage (and reduce the risk to the protocol) since the wider spread between borrow and supply rates will make farming COMP less economical to them.
Compensating users for a market-event that exclusively affected the Compound protocol in a timely manner is an important step towards improving the protocol. Other protocols that have been affected by adverse market events, such as Pickle, Yearn, Opyn, Hegic, and other trustworthy exchanges have reimbursed users for protocol hiccups. This compensation proposal, along with the DAI reserve change, is one of many future steps in engaging the community around important governance issues and working together on further improvements.",79,80.8,2020-12-10

The 8% is coming from the liquidation incentive liquidators get paid to close our undercollateralized positions. Basically, it’s the incentive fee for liquidators to run bots. This 8% incentive fee gets paid from the user’s collateral(s) balance. When a liquidator repays up to 50% of the undercollateralized loan, the liquidator gets back 8% in the collateral of their choice, so long as the user had it enabled as collateral type. Because users were borrowing DAI against many different types of collateral supported on Compound, user’s losses varied in non-trivial ways.

Data

List of addresses liquidated during event

Analysis
Fundamentally, the protocol and price feed performed as designed; real trading, on America’s largest exchange, was used to aggressively reduce the risk of borrowers in the protocol. What was unexpected was the adverse market condition that occurred, how quickly it occurred, and for many users, that it could occur at all.
The DAI market on Compound, with 1.6 billion DAI supplied and 1.3 billion DAI borrowed, has grown far larger and more rapidly than anyone had anticipated. The Compound DAI market eclipses both the underlying DAI market, the liquidity on exchanges, and the global trading volume of DAI by a vast margin. This exact risk is at the core of the Gauntlet Market Risk Assessment.
Next Steps
This liquidation event should be a wake-up call to calibrate the protocol, which has scaled rapidly over the summer. I recommend that the community discuss what steps, if any, should be taken to prevent similar liquidations from occurring in the future.
Broadly, potential changes could include:

Modifying the DAI market parameters, including the Borrowing Cap, to reduce the size of the DAI market relative to trading venues
Modifying the DAI price feed by either tightening the anchor bounds, capping the price (e.g. to 1.05), or utilizing additional reporters
Removing the reporter in some/all cases and relying only on Uniswap, or taking an entirely different approach

Not only should most of these liquidations not have happened, folks that had non-DAI collateral lost ~30% of value of their collateral in the liquidation process due to the erroneous oracle allowing the collateral to be seized at an adverse and improper exchange rate.

agree.


Modifying the DAI price feed by either tightening the anchor bounds, capping the price (e.g. to 1.05), or utilizing additional reporters


I think that it is not good idea to set capping DAI level because it is designed to accept some volatility and balance its stability with the incentive mechanism.
if we reduce anchored Uniswap bounds into 10% and it has not enough incentive for liquidators(considering 8% premium), it could bring the insolvent situation.
so…in the addition to Coinbase Pro, using an average price from multiple price feed sources is better for reducing this kinds of risk.
btw, adding OKEx feed into designated reporter in UniswapAnchoredView is required to create new proposal? This is one of urgent action we need to avoid potential same types of issues.

operating only single point of price feed system is not a good idea. (in AMM, LP has no loyalty)
I don’t have any good idea excepting increasing more reporters in the current open price feed model.

['DAI Liquidation Event'],"Chainlink is the way to go. If you want to see the difference to the open oracle, check here. The DAI/ETH price is delivered by 9 oracles and is aggregated (averaged), so large deviations like the one of Coinbase are ironed out. Integration is very easy.
This would also come with two other benefits:

When adding new coins to Compound you are not limited to the coins which are offered by the Coinbase API. Chainlink offers prices for a much large range of coins.
You are no longer dependent on volunteers to post the current prices to the blockchain, which leads to outdated prices. With Chainlink prices are updated regularly automatically.
",94,138.6,2020-11-27
['DAI Liquidation Event'],"Earlier, I shared a brief summary of my thoughts on this matter in Discord. Below, I share an extended perspective.
Summary of the Exploit :
It is clear that this event was a target exploit of the Compound protocol through a manipulated oracle, which the Compound system used to drive liquidation events. The broad market DAI price was roughly $1.03 on all major exchanges except very briefly on the two exchanges which Compound uses for its oracle input, where the price was manipulated to a value of roughly $1.30, causing this cascade of liquidations. The protocol functioned as written, however it cannot be said that the protocol was functioning as intended, as I do not believe that the intention of the Compound protocol was to have mass liquidations due to faulty inputs. In software engineering, this is called a bug and these bugs often lead attack vectors such as the one that currently exists in Compound.
Remedies:
Compound is a leader in this space. Accordingly, all eyes will be on the Compound community and the steps we collectively decide to take. Whether Compound remains a leader into the future, or fades, will depend on some key community decisions.
Community:
For the long-term health of the Compound protocol (and by extension the value of the COMP token), it makes sense to compensate victims of this recent attack. The reputation of Compound—the goodwill and trust of users—is paramount to the success of the protocol. Damaging this relationship would be damaging to the protocol.
Precedent for providing a remedy has been seen in previous DeFi incidents where a faulty protocol weakness was exploited (e.g., Yearn, Harvest, etc). Historically, maintaining this goodwill strengthened these projects technically and from a community perspective. Accordingly, a minor dilution of the COMP token to maintain this goodwill is worthwhile in the long run. By way of example, maintaining a good community relationship effectively saved Harvest . These precedents can be used as a basis to kickstart compensation discussion.
Technical:
The oracle vulnerability is still a gaping hole that needs to be addressed. Can an attacker still manipulate the price of assets reported by the Compound oracle beyond their current fair market value? If an attacker can still perform this exploit, resolving this issue should be an immediate priority. Moreover, if this exploit is still performable, Compound should not be used by anyone. Additional price feeds are a band-aid solution but may be appropriate in the short term if diverse enough. This is a deeper discussion for the Compound community. If this exploit uniquely affects DAI, then disabling DAI is another option.
A long-term solution requires investment into a robust oracle system, which is another deeper discussion for the Compound community.
Another wise investment may be an insurance fund which may be deployed in the case of unanticipated protocol attacks, however, this is also a deeper discussion.
The Compound community should act in the interest of the community . It is wise to proceed strategically, thinking of the long term and what will both remedy the technical issue and promote community health going forward.",94,148.6,2020-11-27
['DAI Liquidation Event'],"There is another aspect to consider here as far as reimbursements go. If all the affected people who are yield farming, kept their COMP, they would actually have decent amount of votes to vote for a good resolution for themselves. (Especially pretty large yield farmer with >30 million supply).
However, if most of the affected people were selling COMP directly into the market they wont actually have any influence on the direction of the protocol, hence can’t really get the resolution that they want.
This is a good demonstration that if you are doing riskier things with Compound with large amount of capital, it is a good idea to keep the COMP that you are earning, because you will need it to resolve issues in your favor down the line. (This won’t be the first, or last large issue that protocol will run into)",89,72.6,2020-11-27
['DAI Liquidation Event'],"I’m very sympathetic to those who were affected in this event.
I sense three trends of discussions in the comments that were brought up already:

What happened?
How do we prevent it?
Incurred losses

Without fully understanding the event itself, it would be extremely tough to tackle the other two issues. For the interest of risk management, I recommend that we first focus the discussion on gathering data and fully understanding the event with the goal of turning the discussion into swift actionable items for governance to prevent this from happening again.
It would be wise to separate these two tracks to allow the discussion around incurred losses receive the attention it deserves while we can remain swift about risk management.",89,67.6,2020-11-27

Thanks",93,48.4,2020-11-27
['DAI Liquidation Event'],"In whose favor should COMP token holders vote? Systems like Compound are created so that everyone votes in their favor because they have “skin in the game”. (Correct me if I’m wrong)
As for sell pressure I agree with you - maybe some lock period for the affected address would be the solution - of course with COMP use case on Compound(collateral).",94,48.6,2020-11-27
['DAI Liquidation Event'],"Absolutely agree with everything written here. Defending Compound’s solvency is obviously a primary goal, but so should be defending the users of the protocol. The market price of DAI was never over $1.03. Coinbase Pro’s price was off market, and manipulated. What happened here was clearly an exploit. And Compound’s users lost. It is a small price for Comp token holders to take a bit of dilution and make this situation right for the users of the protocol. As 4d mentions, there is precedent for this. It is further salt in the wound that the Compound interface declares using 80% of borrowing capacity as “safe”, when clearly this exploit made that not the case.
On the technical front, in the event that there are disparate prices, I would argue the protocol should use the lowest liquid price available for borrowed assets and the highest prices available for supplied assets. Why? Because defending Compound’s users should also be a top priority in conjunction with defending the protocol’s solvency. If there were DAI available on the market for $1.01 or $1.03, then we would presume that these could be sourced to repay the loans. We wouldn’t presume a reasonable actor would wish to find the most expensive DAI in order to repay and make their position whole.
In this case, the protocol failed, and used an off-market, high, illiquid price to price the borrowed assets and this resulted in the seizure of assets at a 22% discount, plus the 8% penalty, resulting in a 30% loss of deposited collateral on positions that should never have been liquidated.",99,169.6,2020-11-27
['Asset Onboarding Framework'],"The introduction of the Chainlink oracle is a great step forward for Compound, which can usher in the next phase of growth for the protocol on Ethereum. Now that Compound has started to list more assets, we wanted to try to add a better structure to the listing process which would help the protocol manage the risk associated with these new assets in a principled way. Maker has a process for this, as does Aave, however we wanted to focus on specifying what will work best for Compound.
We’ll first break down these risks into a couple different categories, and then outline a process for addressing these risks while maintaining a clear path for listing new assets and allowing the protocol to grow aggressively.

Risks in Compound

We view the goal of a lending protocol as simple - to let anyone in the world lend or borrow digital assets.  We use “anyone” quite broadly here, including other smart contracts. To maximize that goal, and the value created by the protocol, the protocol should try to maximize the number of people and protocols who desire to and are able to participate. Adding more assets is a great way to do that, but if in doing so, the protocol destroys user trust, this would not maximize long term usage. We’ll try to list out the ways the protocol might damage that trust here:

A user who supplies tokens is unable to withdraw them

Insolvency risk - the value of the funds held by the protocol is less than the liabilities of the protocol.
Liquidity risk - the funds users wish to withdraw are not available for withdrawal, though the protocol holds other tokens of sufficient value to eventually allow the withdrawal


A user who borrows funds pays unnecessary fees

Someone manipulates the price of assets, either in the oracle or by taking advantage of limited market liquidity to create large price swings. This can cause liquidations on assets that belies expectation and borrowers would pay liquidation penalties
An interest rate curve for an asset creates swing in interest rates that would appear usurious


A protocol hack or bug

Someone finds a vulnerability in the protocol that allows them to withdraw a ton of value from the protocol, often referred to as a protocol “hack”
An error in the honest execution of an action, in this case, adding a new asset, that could destroy or lose user funds

Assets that rebase like AMPL, which behave differently than standard ERC20s, can be prone to these issues. I’m not picking on AMPL here - it’s been added to AAVE after extensive testing and so it is a great example that when these risks arise, how they can be addressed.





Here at Gauntlet, we focus on market risks like insolvency and fees, and will be publishing a proposal for how we can help the protocol manage market risks and capital efficiency soon.

The Process

We’ll suggest the following four* phases for collateral onboarding:


Application

Explaining what the token does and why listing it as an asset will bring value to Compound. Key risks like volatility will be addressed in this stage as well.



Implementation Review

Review contract deployments, scenario testing, etc. Would be great if any community developers could chime in here @arr00, @tylerether, @blck, etc



Proposal

Pushing the proposal to vote and allowing the community to vote on chain to either accept or reject the asset



Post-Launch Parameter Update

After launch, increasing collateral factor to a safe level and setting the reserve factor in line with other assets



Over the next few days, we’ll publish a set of checklists as guides for each phase. These checklists will follow directly from the risks identified above so that we can be sure those are addressed as new assets are onboarded. To provide an example of what these will look like, we provide a draft outline of the first stage here:

Collateral Onboarding Application

Overview

What is the token name and ticker symbol?
What the the token do?
What additional risks might supporting this token create?
What audits, if any, have been done?
Have there ever been any protocol hacks? If so, when? How were they addressed?


Market Risk Information

What venues allow for the trading of this asset?
How much liquidity is there on each of these venues?
How has that liquidity changed over time? One way to show this is with rolling 30/60/90 averages.
What is the historical volatility of this asset?


Decentralization

How is this asset distributed amongst token holders?

GINI Coefficient
Largest 10 positions and the percent of total float they constitute


How is the supply of this currency controlled?
Centralization scale (Centrally Backed → Permisionless)


Asset Listing Request

Collateral Factor  - will be 0 for all assets until after launch
Reserve Factor (probably should start pretty high)
Borrow Cap
Interest Rate Curve

Should likely start with an existing interest rate curve





We look forward to working with the community to publishing the rest of these checklists and identifying owners for each step of the process.

My first read here is that the highest ROI additions to Compound are digital assets - just looking at the most popular ERC20s by volume, liquidity, and market cap. Down the line, as Compound is able to support more assets, the community will have some real questions to answer on what risks real world assets create and how to address them.",33,36.4,2021-08-31

TLDR. . .
Issues

The Compound community is not aligned around a clear roadmap or long-term vision
Contributors aren’t properly empowered to contribute, making it difficult to get anything done
The governance process lacks structure and is difficult to navigate
Resources are very disorganized; we rely on part-time contributors to independently step up to solve core issues
The current ‘contributor experience’ is poor, hindering COMPs ability to recruit & retain contributors
Token holders aren’t well-positioned to judge the security of proposals; security & testing standards/support don’t really exist

Possible next steps

Hire governance facilitator
Explicitly centralize development of COMP’s long-term strategy
Define standards for asset additions, parameter logic, proposal process, and security/testing
Build out a team—separate from Compound Labs—to serve community-driven initiatives (or hire dev shops to fill the gap)
Create technical review committee or “Risk DAO”

['Compound governance is disorganized'],"Some great points made here. At Gauntlet, we’ve been working to share some thoughts on an asset onboarding framework, and plan to do so by EOW.
One note to possible contributors - it’s totally possible to have a narrow focus. One hard thing about jumping in to the protocol is where to start. If you have a clear plan for what you could do a as a governance facilitator, by all means, jump right in. However if you are wondering how you could help, focusing on driving value and taking ownership over one domain of the DAO’s efforts might be a good way to bootstrap the working groups mentioned in @JacobPPhillips’s doc.",67,168.2,2021-08-19
['Compound governance is disorganized'],"Jacob your report seems to align strongly with some of the issues voiced on the community call yesterday. One critical issue I picked up on was around protocol governance and the grants program, specifically the balance between agenda and agency. As Getty mentioned, it is difficult to both gauge and enforce the caliber of contributors who pick up grants, however the frequency of grant adoption and execution is an important factor to maintain for the protocol’s growth. At a glance, hiring a governance facilitator, or general team centralization might be an apt way to solve this, to add culpability and oversight to “part time” contributors. However, if not structured delicately enough, could also lead to over-centralization risks and dilution of user voting power, potentially causing the protocol governance to function virtually like a public tech company.
I like your idea of building out a specialized team in charge of “serving community-driven initiatives” and hiring/overseeing the devs which execute it. I think an important issue as mentioned is culpability, and so structuring development teams with deliverables and specialized oversight would be effective to mitigate improper resource allocation.
I think there are some elegant solutions to balancing team efficiency, with some centralization, whilst democratizing and incentivizing voting activity amongst the larger community. Perhaps this could take place in conjunction with the user-whitelisting proposal. A specialized full-time oversight team, for example, could work intimately with whitelisted users - who’s proposals the community votes on - and see through the execution of their initiatives. A governance facilitator could then be in charge of providing consistent concise (and jargon-translated) community reports on those teams’ progress to the broader community, and users can vote on their satisfaction (with perhaps some comp incentive). This all leads to providing more metrics for larger voters to better track progress in the protocol.",65,182.8,2021-08-19
['Compound governance is disorganized'],"I can’t think of a more important discussion to have right now. Thanks for bringing it up @JacobPPhillips.
I agree with pretty much all of the points mentioned in the writeup. That said, maybe I can chime in with some thoughts based on my experiences running Compound Grants for the last few months. Some of the thoughts may be redundant to what was previously mentioned; my intention is to share similar ideas from what is possibly another point of view.


The protocol needs vision. If Compound’s treasury is putting significant amounts of money to work, it needs to do so with an explicit long-term goal in mind. In my mind, the question that needs to be answered is “what does the protocol want to be in ten years?” If we can find an answer to that long-term goal, we can develop medium-term goals that achieve the long-term goal and short-term goals that achieve the medium-term goals. None of this is rocket science of course — that’s how companies, governments, and other organizations get stuff done! You can’t build a skyscraper by randomly laying down bricks; you need to have a blueprint that tells you where to place the bricks.


The protocol needs to hire the best people. Once the protocol figures out what it wants to be in ten years, it needs to recruit the people to make the vision a reality. In common parlance, that’s called recruiting talent. More specifically, the protocol needs to recruit people who will build the thing based on a blueprint. To date, Compound Grants has funded part-time contractors (“contributors”) to work on fairly minor improvements to the protocol. While these efforts go a long way, I don’t believe they’re enough. If the protocol wants to be great ten years from now, incremental improvements are not enough. What’s needed are major improvements, which I believe are best developed by people who are motivated, capable, and determined. In short, I strongly believe the protocol should hire the best people to work on major improvements on a full-time basis. I should also note that top talent is not cheap; if the protocol has the money (and it does), it should be paying above-market salaries to attract above-average people.


The protocol needs organization. After the vision is defined and the people are hired, an organization needs to be formed. Motivated, capable, and determined people working in an uncoordinated fashion don’t get stuff done — you can swat a fly with a finger, but if you want to take down a wolf, you’ll need to clench five fingers into a punch. Coordination and organization is how countries are formed, cities are built, and products made. I think everyone will agree that right now, protocol contributors are uncoordinated and disorganized. If the protocol wants to win big, it will need to form an organization around the talent.


Should the protocol continue doing what it has historically done, I’m afraid we’ll end up in a situation J Cole sung about: the good news is you came a long way; the bad news is you went the wrong way.",61,102.0,2021-08-20
['Compound governance is disorganized'],"Thanks for bringing this issue @JacobPPhillips.  As a new member to the Compound governance forum, I had the following issues:

No centralized location/summary of governance process – Any new member should have access to governance handbook/overview to quickly catch up to the process.
Vision – Went through the different topics @ comp.xyz and compound.finance website, and I could not really fine what the future vision or goals (both short/long term).  Having a vision will make everything easier in terms of governance, planning and organizing.  All future proposals will be geared towards accomplishing our vision/goals.
During my first community meeting, members were discussing collateral factors for the newly voted Markets. The process seemed very casual (although it appeared everyone was on board with suggested collateral factors) with no formal guidelines/procedures.  Compound is known in our industry/community for being the most “conservative” and rigorous interest rate protocol, yet this only seems to be true on paper.

My suggestion is creating a Compound Governance Handbook. This handbook will establish our objectives/goals for the future, governance process, new market eligibility requirements, collateral factors for supply/borrow side and other items.

Compound (Protocol) Governance Handbook:
Motto:
Compound (protocol) is an algorithmic, autonomous interest rate protocol built for developers, to unlock a universe of open applications.
Objective: What is our objective/goals?

Short Term
Long Term

Governance:


Overview: The Compound protocol is governed and upgraded by COMP token-holders, who may delegate their voting rights to addresses. Proposals can modify system parameters, support new markets, or add entirely new functionality to the protocol.

Proposal: Addresses delegated at least 65,000 COMP can create governance proposals; any address can lock 100 COMP to create an Autonomous Proposal, which becomes a governance proposal after being delegated 65,000 COMP.
Delegate: Delegate votes from the sender to the delegatee. Users can delegate to 1 address at a time, and the number of votes added to the delegatee’s vote count is equivalent to the balance of COMP in the user’s account. Votes are delegated from the current block and onward, until the sender delegates again, or transfers their COMP.
Proposal Threshold: The minimum number of votes required for an account to create a proposal (currently 65,000 COMP) can be changed through governance.

Voting: When a governance proposal is created:
Enters a 2 day review period;
After which voting weights are recorded and voting begins;
Voting lasts for 3 days; if a majority, and at least 400,000 votes are cast for the proposal, it is queued in the Timelock; and
Implemented 2 days later (changes takes at least one week)

Market Eligibility Requirement:

Market’s Safety Characteristics
Market’s protocol has been reviewed and audited by independent auditors and/or consultants and has no known security vulnerabilities, including critical bugs, undue exposure to 51% attacks
Market must have sufficient liquidity across a variety of trading platforms
Market’s Supply and Volume Characteristics
Market capitalization of $100 million or above
Supply to be reasonably predicted over the next five years
Market’s descriptive Characteristics
Secured digital bearer instrument
Freely traded market and can be freely held for foreseeable future
Must not be considered a security by the corresponding authorities across different jurisdictions
Market Protocol is decentralized
Included by two or more third party custodian
Other
Market protocol must have significant usage and community

Collateral Factors for New Markets:

Collateral factor can range from 0-90%, and represents the proportionate increase in liquidity (borrow limit) that an account receives
Collateral factors can be increased (or decreased), as market conditions change
Starting collateral factor should be the average of the market in at least three other similar interest rate protocols
Borrow vs. Supply side factors?
What is a “conservative” market?
Demand is a major factor?

['Permissionless Listing / Isolated Markets'],"I’ve had an idea in the back of my mind for the past month now, so let’s bring it to light!
Wouldn’t it be great to support the lending and borrowing of any sort of crypto asset? I have yet to see support for this in DeFi.
The main challenge to this idea is that every new market on Compound presents risks to the whole protocol. What if one token added as a market experiences a rug pull, price manipulation, or some other similar situation? Liquidations and losses can occur across all of the markets on Compound.
So how can we mitigate or contain these risks while simultaneously offering permissionless listings? Isolated markets!
Right now when you deposit an asset as collateral on Compound (granted > 0% collateral factor), you can borrow any other asset supported by Compound.
With isolated markets, we can use pairs, where the collateralization of one asset allows for the borrowing of ONLY the other asset for the pair.
Let’s consider an example: isolated GRT/USDC market. Are you a holder of USDC and you believe GRT is a safe asset? Lend out your USDC in this pool. What if all suppliers borrowing USDC against GRT get liquidated? The pool would be composed of mostly GRT. How comfortable are you as a USDC lender? If you’re not comfortable with this scenario, then simply don’t participate in this market. If you are comfortable with this, then you have an opportunity to make interest on your USDC at the rate of this specific isolated market.
The risk of permissionless listing is then contained to each and every isolated market.
The benefit of permissionless listing for, say, stablecoin lenders is that they have MANY more opportunities to make interest on their stablecoins. Theoretically, the more risky the non-stablecoin asset is, the higher the APR will be for lending stablecoins. The stablecoin lenders more skilled in risk assessment and management will then have much more opportunity to make higher returns.
There are most likely still risks to the overall protocol involved with this idea, as well as various challenges. Let’s discuss them here!
Going forward in this thread, let’s refer to the current Compound markets as cross markets and the new idea as isolated markets.",66,253.0,2021-06-01

['Permissionless Listing / Isolated Markets'],"Interesting, maybe compound could be a Kashi strategy? if I am saying that right?",50,9.8,2021-06-21
['Permissionless Listing / Isolated Markets'],"Thanks for sharing this idea on the dev call today. I support the aspiration to offer permissionless listings for isolated markets. That said, I think the reputational risk to the protocol can’t be overstated. Kashi has been running for a while now, on multiple chains, but it still hosts a small, selective set of lend/borrow markets with Chainlink oracles.
We know from the experience of other protocols that permissionless listing on a protocol with decent network effects attracts projects seeking to take advantage of new user naivety. For example, if you quickly peruse recent activity in the Uniswap Discord, you’ll find a deluge of new Uniswap users clamoring for help after trading or providing liquidity to long-tail assets – dog tokens, “safe” this-or-that tokens, tokens with transfer taxes – with enormous slippage and finding themselves unable to trade out and/or frustrated that they have to pay for failed transactions. These are users completely new to DeFi buying a meme token on Uniswap, then failing to be able to sell it despite paying a huge gas fee, and their impression at the end of the day is that they have been robbed and that Uniswap is the thief.
It would be painful to see people having similar first-time experiences with the Compound protocol.
Assuming crypto market caps take off again within the next several years, permissionless listing for isolated lending/borrowing markets will bring the next generation of meme tokens, projects with tax-on-transfer and/or Ponzi-like tokenomics. Those projects will permissionlessly list lending markets for their tokens and announce them as “partnerships” with Compound to lend credibility, bringing novice users to the protocol. With lower liquidity and easier-to-attack-oracles, these markets are likely to be very high-risk for novice users, leaving most of them with fewer assets and a sour taste in their mouth about Compound and DeFi in general.
Long term, I love the idea of permissionless listing. How can Compound do it in a way that disincentivizes opportunistic money-grab projects and proactively educates users about the higher market and oracle risks of lending/borrowing long-tail assets? Or do folks feel like such efforts would amount to censorship?",47,164.4,2021-06-30
['Permissionless Listing / Isolated Markets'],"Great feedback, I really appreciate it!
I am very supportive of the free market. One of the things that I love most about DeFi is how there are no governments or regulators here to “protect” users or to fix markets.
Like here in Canada and the US, regulators “protect” investors by severely limiting access to investment opportunities because of risk. In doing so, these regulators severely limit the average person’s ability to learn how to significantly grow their wealth. In particular, accredited investors get access to MANY more and better deals, but one has to first make $1M to get that accredited status.
Protecting users from anything which could hurt them generally hurts them more because they’re denied the opportunity to learn and grow.
But yes, Compound does have a reputation to maintain and we don’t want users to get scammed or lose a lot of money. It also goes without saying that protocol security is of utmost importance.
Therefore, it’s our responsibility to educate users on the risks and to develop a UI/UX which aids the user in this regard as much as possible.",42,23.4,2021-06-30

Infrastructure: Price Oracle
A really basic overview of the price oracle to be used in these isolated markets are as follows.

If the price exists in Compound’s Chainlink powered UniswapAnchoredView, use that price. Otherwise,
Use a TWAP of the price returned from a DEX aggregator.

We first try to use the price reported by Compound’s current price oracle as this feed contains the most accurate, secure, and reliable prices.
Since Chainlink only supports a limited number of assets and we want to support any asset, we must get the price from a different source if our current price feed doesn’t support the asset in question.
The best on-chain source for prices are DEXs, but which DEX is best? Well, we can’t rely on any single DEX for prices because liquidity is fragmented across DeFi. The exchange with the most liquidity usually has the most reliable price. Hence the need to use a DEX aggregator.

1inch as Price Oracle
1inch is arguably the best 100% on-chain DEX aggregator, so we will use their contract/code.
The source code is available here: https://github.com/1inch/1inchProtocol.
Note: 1inchProtocol was recently deprecated, so we’ll have to coordinate with the 1inch team to maintain it. We could also fork it and maintain it ourselves.
Here’s an example of using the contract to get the price of GRT:

image576×586 31.9 KB

Reported is a price of 0.589060 USDC/GRT.
Is it as easy as this to get the price of any asset? Sadly, no. It’s possible to manipulate this price through one of the supported DEXs which has low liquidity.
Solutions to this problem?

Okay solution: Alter the amount. Maybe 1% of the max supply of the token? 10%? The amount contained in the isolated market? Some combination of these approaches?
Better solution: fork the 1inch contracts to calculate a volume/liquidity weighted price. Impose minimum liquidity constraints to protect us from market manipulation. Remove the swap functionality of these contracts as we don’t need them - reducing overhead.


Conclusion
That’s the end of my basic overview of the proposed price oracle for isolated market supporting permissionless listing.
Please let me know your thoughts!",39,32.8,2021-07-03
['Permissionless Listing / Isolated Markets'],"
Update
I’ve decided to build a new price oracle as there are no existing fully on-chain manipulation resistant reliable price oracles which aggregate multiple DEXs for the purpose of lending and borrowing.
Having a solid fully on-chain price oracle will be the hardest aspect of this proposal. It must be fully on-chain to support permissionless listing. The downside is that a lot of liquidity of various tokens are on CEXs, which makes on-chain prices easier to manipulate.
To combat price manipulation, I’m using the following strategies:

Aggregating DEXs
Weighting the price from each DEX by the total liquidity of the base token (ETH or stablecoin) and possibly other factors
Using sliding window oracles
Using a large observation period (8 hours or more)
Using a somewhat small period granularity (15 minutes)
Choosing the best algorithm(s) to calculate [stable] price and liquidity (for weighting)

One of the easiest ways to manipulate an aggregated DEX price oracle is to create a new liquidity pool on one of the smaller DEXs (assuming one doesn’t exist) and setting the token price really high (or low). Arbitrage bots and regular traders would probably be slow to realize this discrepancy making it less costly to pull off such an attack.
To combat such an attack:

Use large observation windows
Use algorithms that give more weighting to DEXs/pools which have had large amounts of liquidity earlier on

The oracle solution I’m building is/will be very abstract and flexible so as to support many different ways to calculate prices.
More discussion of algorithms and parameters will follow.

['Permissionless Listing / Isolated Markets'],"so what you want to do is create an entire protocol which would involve people actively picking and optimizing dex data sources, weighting, and methodology, continuously and individually for each coin?
i think take a step back and look at what ur proposing.
at that point just start a new oracle protocol.
the focus should be on making it easier to list tokens, not creating an imaginary obstacle course to play mental gymnastics with. adding 300 layers of voting doesn’t make the token listing feel any more permissionless.",33,11.6,2021-07-15
['Permissionless Listing / Isolated Markets'],"Starting a new oracle protocol isn’t out of question (but this is off topic).
The process to get new tokens listed is complex because currently every new asset added adds risk to the entire protocol.
With isolated markets, the risks are a lot more contained. They have to be for permissionless listing so that anyone can list a new market without having to go through the governance process; without putting the entire Compound protocol at risk.
300 layers of voting? No, no, no. Anyone will be able to create a new market at their own discretion. This is why we need a really strong price oracle that is resistant to manipulation.
We won’t need to optimize the parameters for each different coin. We just need one optimal set of parameters for the purpose of lending and borrowing at Compound. Then add DEX configurations here and there (or not). The more DEXs we aggregate, the more reliable and accurate the prices are.",33,6.6,2021-07-15
['Permissionless Listing / Isolated Markets'],"
Oracle Update
I’ve written the majority of the new oracle infrastructure code. Below are some results.
Token = ETH
Base = USDC
UniswapV2 Price = 1785242344 , Token Liquidity = 66009898700084902688646 , Base Liquidity = 117843666286804
UniswapV3 Price = 1785275963 , Token Liquidity = 84902713181993030425960 , Base Liquidity = 46104943013566
Sushiswap Price = 1785850053 , Token Liquidity = 104407714235399694110022 , Base Liquidity = 186456522071834
Aggregate Price = 1785570139 , Token Liquidity = 255320326117477627224628 , Base Liquidity = 350405131372204

The aggregated price is weighted by the liquidity of the base token as the base token will usually be the strongest asset and hardest to manipulate.
An aggregated oracle may seem trivial when used for large-cap tokens. but it’ll be very beneficial for small-cap tokens as they are less costly to manipulate. For example, on UniswapV2, $100k can cause ETH price to move by ~0.38% whereas for BIRD it’s ~12.9%. We can’t assume arbitrage bots/people are actively trading all tokens, so it’s possible for an attacker to manipulate the price on one DEX long enough to liquidate users and make a profit.
Let’s consider the above results in terms of relative cost for manipulation.UniswapV2 has 117843666286804 in base (USDC) liquidity (117,843,666.28 USDC), whereas the aggregate totals 350405131372204 (350,405,131.37 USDC), making the aggregate price about 3x more costly to manipulate. The cost to manipulate the aggregate price goes up with the more liquidity pools (DEXs) we aggregate.
An aggregated oracle is essential for permissionless listing of lending/borrowing markets. The oracle must be very resistant to price manipulation to protect users’ funds which this new oracle system is designed to be.
More updates to follow as I get closer to completing the aggregated oracle.
Side note: Compound’s price anchor to UniswapV2 could be upgraded (in time) to use an aggregate, further strengthening the existing protocol.",32,76.4,2021-07-20

['Permissionless Listing / Isolated Markets'],"@TylerEther,
Is it possible to use data from 3 different protocols (uniswap, sushi, 1inch) for “t” time. Then, rank the protocols from most changed in price to least change in price. Give the protocol with the least change in price 60% weight, while the other two get 30% and 10% respectively. This would make it very difficult to manipulate price since it would have to be done on all 3 markets.
On tokens with very small liquidity, you could add the previous oracle price into the mix of the weighting system. If you gave it 50% all would be needed would be to figure out the above weighting 60/30/10 and then average that price to the previous oracle price.
Just a couple of ideas… I think we should also attack this from a gas perspective as well, to minimize any unwanted gas fees.",24,9.8,2021-08-05

 TylerEther:

I’m not sure how weighting it this way would play out as crypto assets are very volatile.


Using 3 different protocols/markets to help with the risks involved with volatility/manipulation is a good way to combat the risk, especially as you mentioned:



 TylerEther:

To combat such an attack:

Use large observation windows
Use algorithms that give more weighting to DEXs/pools which have had large amounts of liquidity earlier on



However, if you could place emphasis – more weighting – on the protocol that has the least price change would make a malicious actor have to manipulate all 3 markets.
Example:
During the DAI Liquidation Event… If Compound was getting price data from 3 sources. And adjusted weighting system, where:
Price = (Latest Price * 0.25) + (((P0 * 0.6) + (P1 * 0.3) + (P2 * 0.1)) * 0.75)
The latest price of DAI = $1.0005.
Coinbase:  DAI = $1.30
Uniswap: DAI = $1.005
1inch : DAI = $1.05
Price = ($1.005 * 0.25) + ((($1.005 * 0.6) + ($1.05 * 0.3) + ($1.30 * 0.1) * 0.75)
P = $0.25125 + ($0.603 + $0.315 + $0.13) * 0.75
P = $0.25125 + ($1.048) * 0.75
P = $0.25125 + $0.786
P = $1.03725
Doing the weighting like this would make it to where a malicious actor would have to move all 3 markets. You could even drop the algorithms (less gas) you were planning on using to weight DEXs by liquidity. Even if the bad actor was able to move the largest AMM pool’s price significantly, it would have less than a 10% weight factor.
Hope I explained it right, just want to simplify the oracle while maintaining the lowest risk possible and maybe even saving a lil gas.",23,9.6,2021-08-05
['Permissionless Listing / Isolated Markets'],"Interesting idea, would be great for pegged/stable coins which are expected to not change much.
As for other tokens whose prices fluctuate a lot, I’m not sure if this would work well.
Here’s an attack scenario for this idea. We aggregate Uniswap V2, V3, and Sushiswap. There’s some small-cap token, $XYZ, which is only listed on Uniswap V2. An attacker creates a pool on Uniswap V3 with only $1 worth of assets and initializes it at a very low price. Arbitrageurs won’t trade in this pool as gas costs are higher than the value extracted, keeping the low initial price. An aggregated oracle would then give the highest weighting to this data source - as the price doesn’t move - resulting in a price much lower than the market price. The attacker is then able to liquidate loans where $XYZ is the collateral.
If this attack scenario were to use the base token (ETH) liquidity strategy, the low amount of tokens used to create the pool would have almost zero effect on the aggregated price (assuming Uniswap V2 has much more liquidity).
Keep the ideas coming! Every challenge to ideas proposed here will make the final product more resilient. ",21,9.2,2021-08-06
['Permissionless Listing / Isolated Markets'],"Here’s an overview of what I’ve designed so far.

image664×809 10.7 KB

We have 3 data sources: Uniswap V2, Uniswap V3, and Sushiswap. We create 3 different sliding window oracles - one for each data source - and they all use time-weighted average algorithms to calculate price and liquidity.
Then we have our aggregated oracle which takes the market data (price and liquidity) from the 3 underlying oracles to compute the final price - weighing by the liquidity of the base token (ETH).
Here’s a scenario - getting the price of XYZ, denominated by ETH (XYZ/ETH pools).
Uniswap V2: price(XYZ) = 1 ETH, liquidity(ETH) = 100
Uniswap V3: price(XYZ) = 0.01 ETH, liquidity(ETH) = 0.0001 ETH
Sushiswap: price(XYZ) = 0.95 ETH, liquidity(ETH) = 8

totalBaseLiquidity = 108.0001
aggregatedPrice(XYZ) = 1*(100/108.0001) + 0.01*(0.0001/108.0001) + 0.95*(8/108.0001) = 0.996295383

Without the innaccurate price from Uniswap V3:
aggregatedPrice(XYZ) = 1*(100/108) + 0.95*(8/108) = 0.996296296

The presence of the attacker’s Uniswap V3 pool had an impact of 0.000000913 ETH on the final price. 
I argue that if gas and protocol fees were 0, arbitrageurs would correct the price discrepancy between Uniswap V2 and Sushiswap to around the price reported by the aggregated oracle (all other things held constant) as the price impact of trades is determined by the liquidity of the pool. I’m too lazy to mathematically prove this point.
Going back to the design of this system, the underlying oracles have been designed to be immutable so that they can be used by other protocols without the concern of anything changing. The more other DeFi protocols use these immutable oracles, the less gas consumed by the ecosystem as a whole, benefiting everyone, and lessening the oracle maintainer responsibilities of individual protocols.
I’ll publish the aggregated oracle system on Github tomorrow. ",22,109.4,2021-08-06

Oh, I didn’t clarify. The more weighting would go to the protocol/pool that had the least price change from the previous oracle price, not the actual protocol’s change in price.
Previous oracle price in the above example was $1.0005 which gave the Uniswap price of $1.005 more weight since it represents the least change. This should work on any asset, really. If the asset is highly volatile across all pools then it would still be weighted 25% from the previous oracle price.",22,9.4,2021-08-06

Jared – Gateway Update – (Starts at 00:00)
Jared from Compound Labs provided an update on Gateway development. After running into issues with the current Gateway implementation on Substrate, the team weighed switching to other chains before ultimately deciding to stick with substrate and re-architect the implementation from the ground up. The team decoupled the application code from Substrate and separated the validation of blocks from Oracle capabilities in order to increase security and permit the use of hard code keys for Oracles. This also permits the team to not need to rely on off chain workers in Substrate. The new architecture greatly decreases what the runtime is doing, splits the responsibility to the Oracles, and still permits the optionality to operate as a parachain. Code progress can be monitored in the Compound GitHub and in the Compound Discord.
Getty – New Assets – (Starts at 10:10)
Getty reviewed Proposal 56, which added collateral factors for four assets: MKR, SUSHI, YFI, and LINK. He detailed how the new CFs represent conservative thinking based on three main factors: exchange liquidity, exchange market availability, and market use cases. While the CFs remain relatively low for now, these factors can always be revisited further down the road and eventually moved higher. More information can be found here.
TylerEther – COMP speeds – (Starts at 13:50)
TylerEther discussed a few bugs related to the compSpeed parameter. He mentions that two separate but related bugs were affecting particular markets. The first bug arises when compSpeeds are set to 0 for new assets and then an attempt is made to increase those speeds. In this instance, the compSpeed would not update as expected. The second bug takes place when comp speeds were changed in between hypothetical blocks [A], [B], and [C]. The speed dictated on block [C] would retroactively accrue COMP from block [B], which represents the last market activity regardless of how much time has passed. Neither bug threatens fund safety or protocol stability but should be patched nevertheless. Finally, TylerEther mentions a thought for the future where the community could set separate COMP speeds for borrowers and suppliers. More information regarding these two bugs and future improvements can be found here.

FDV is undefined because there is 2.5% inflation indefinitely AND because the SNX token contract is upgradable, so supply could change.

sDao, a 3 person multisig, holds the treasury (14% of SNX). Control of the treasury is on track to being controlled by a larger multisig elected by token holders.
Oracle Issues and Improvements:
Synthetix has a history of problems related to oracles. Most recently they’ve had front-running attacks depending on oracle update frequency and synth volatility. These attacks have increased the debt of SNX stakers.
Synthetics now uses Chainlink for oracles. They hope to mitigate front-running by moving to optimistic ethereum which will enable more frequent oracle updates. There is talk of changing their L1 oracle architecture to reduce attack vectors: Oracle Threshold signatures.",26,25.2,2021-08-18

['Add Market: SNX'],"Summary and Next Steps
SNX is Not Currently Fit for Compound
The addition of a cSNX market to Compound is being postponed. There are two reasons. First, adding SNX as collateral is a security risk, as described below. Second, there is a Synthetix update, SynthetixV3, targeted for Q1 2022. This update would require Compound to redeploy the cSNX market. It also could address the security risk.
The Risk of Adding SNX as a Collateral Asset
The SNX token is upgradable by the pDAO multisig without a time delay . This is risky for integrated contracts. For example, community member @aaaaaaaaaaaaa identified a vulnerability from upgradable tokens used as collateral. The balanceOf() function in the underlying token contract could be upgraded to the following:
balanceOf(address) { if address is cSNX return 10000*true_balance }
This means cSNX holders would be able to borrow 10000x what they otherwise could. Therefore, adding SNX as collateral puts all of Compound’s collateral in the hands of the pDAO multisig which is not incentivised to act in Compound’s best interest.
Next Steps for Synthetix
A time delay on token contract upgrades could mitigate this risk by allowing Compound enough time to pause the markets if a malicious upgrade is made. The delay may need to be several days or longer to make sure Compound has enough time to organize multisig participants to pause Compound. Perhaps Synthetix could add a time delay on token upgrades as part of SynthetixV3. There may be other ways to limit this risk. For example, Synthetix might limit proxy upgradability.
Next Steps for Compound
Scenario 1: SynthetixV3 is released without adding a pDAO time delay.
Synthetix could be added to Compound as a non-collateral asset.
Scenario 2: SynthetixV3 is released with a pDAO time delay.
Synthetix could be added to Compound as a collateral asset. However, the community may be cautious of adding new contracts as collateral before the test of time.
Because of major changes coming with SynthetixV3, a few things should be reviewed before adding a cSNX market:
Make sure SynthetixV3 has an audit.
Make sure the cToken contracts still appear to work correctly with SNX.
Examine the powers of the pDAO multisig and any timelock duration.
Examine the SNX holdings of the upcoming Treasury Council, which may replace the sDAO multisig.",16,158.2,2021-08-20

The good news is that @getty was able to successfully cancel the UNI proposal because the proposing address’ balance fell below the required threshold during the voting period. Way to go @getty!
Further complicating the matter was a previously undiscovered bug in the withTally interface causing ‘against’ votes to be incorrectly cast on-chain as ‘for’ votes. Fascinating stuff – albeit a bit scary.
Back to the question of cUNI voting: how about streaming COMP to someone (similar to the arrangement for @getty but probably a much lower rate to reflect the less demanding nature of the work) to manage the cUNI delegation process for us going forward? @arr00 has been doing this pro bono, which is lovely, but not as sustainable nor as time-sensitive as we could make it.
@arr00 would be a natural first choice, but they are already juggling several key dev initiatives for the protocol.

I love the idea about delegating the cUNI governance process to someone (or maybe even a small 2/3 multisig?) in order to keep this up-to-date and running. While it might not seem necessary all the time, this shows that on a short notice, we would have had a lot of potential power locked into the contract with no easy way to utilize the stake, unless withdrawn, so worth now making sure this is not going to happen again in the future.
Seeing how it is work for cUNI holders, why not directly stream some accrued cUNI from the reserve to this position? I think whoever gets the job would be happy either way :))

['Floating Stablecoin Prices'],"Idea: migrate USDC, USDT, and TUSD to use a floating oracle price.
The Comptroller value for stablecoins like USDC, USDT, and TUSD is currently fixed at $1. However, there is a very real risk that one or more of these tokens loses its peg in the future. I propose that we switch these to floating oracle prices–the same way that every other token on Compound works, including Dai.
Leaving these prices fixed at $1 will lead to many problems in the event that one depegs. I’ll illustrate the worst one I can think of:

Suppose USDC value slips to $0.50. Compound continues to value it at $1 for collateral purposes.
Arbitrageurs can deposit 1 USDC, which cost them $0.50, and borrow $0.75 of value.
They will borrow all of the liquidity of every asset, stealing 33% of all of Compound’s liquidity value.

Worked example:

$0.5 / USDC
$100 worth of liquidity on Compound
Arbitrageurs deposit 133 USDC to access $100 of borrowing power on Compound (USDC collateral factor is 0.75). They withdraw all liquidity.
Compound now has 133 USDC worth $.5 each, or $66 in value, vs the $100 it started with.





Of course, there are downsides to a floating oracle, including the risk that the system works as designed. An alternative change, suitable as an intermediate solution, is to sanity check the fixed $1 price against Uniswap (“Anchor price”), just as we do for all of the oracle-reported tokens.
Note: this topic originated as a suggestion from @aklamun in repayBorrow() with cToken thread.",33,36.6,2021-07-19
['Floating Stablecoin Prices'],"Note that it’s not straightforward to check the USDC price in USD using a Uniswap anchored price (or really any DEX). You can only compare with on-chain traded assets, in this case how USDC is priced in terms of other stablecoins, which may also have pricing problems. Another option is checking the USDC price in terms of ETH coupled with a trusted ETH price oracle (which Compound relies on currently anyway).",24,24.8,2021-08-06
['Floating Stablecoin Prices'],"Good point! Wow, I didn’t realize ETH-USDC Uniswap pair was used for computing the anchor price–I assumed the Reporter (chainlink) ETH price was used.
This means there’s another really bad consequence of USDC depegging. If USDC trades below $0.87, all of the oracle reported prices will fall outside their anchor, and will cease being updated. Am I reading correctly that transactions are allowed to process and the comptroller just uses the old price? That seems like a potential vulnerability–shouldn’t the comptroller just refuse to process new transactions until it can get a recent price?",23,24.6,2021-08-09
['Floating Stablecoin Prices'],"I’m not sure on the particulars here since the update to integrating Chainlink (haven’t had the chance to review everything). But to the extent that a Uniswap anchored price is still used, it is presumably measured in USDC. Aggregating oracle prices with appropriate manipulation checks is definitely worth thinking through carefully",19,18.8,2021-08-13
['Add Market: LINK'],"Chainlink is arguably one of the most reputable, trusted, and valuable blockchain protocols, ranked the 10th largest coin by market cap at nearly $13B.
I am proposing adding a market for $LINK as a collateral asset.
Here are a few reasons why we should do so:


Used as collateral. Ideally, I think anyone should be able to borrow against any of their assets provided there is a market for it. The more assets we support, the greater financial freedom and capital efficiency we offer to DeFi users around the globe. This is especially important for the unbanked.


OTC desks can quickly borrow at market rates to sell large amounts of tokens to their clients without much delay. Borrowing this way is much less risky for them to operate than for them to constantly hold large amounts of various volatile tokens.


Allowing for strategic governance voting using borrowed tokens.


It is true that there is a risk when adding any asset as a collateral asset. While there is a risk, offering more collateralizable markets increases the value of the compound protocol, increases the utility of DeFi and crypto, and provides more financial freedom and capital efficiency to users (especially the unbanked).
To ensure the safety of the Compound protocol, we must carefully manage risk. In this case, we can do this by fine-tuning the collateral factor, reserve factor, and borrowing limits for $LINK.
I’d like to open up a discussion as to what the optimal initial values of these risk-related factors should be.
Once we come to a majority agreement on this, I will deploy the contracts and create an autonomous proposal to be voted on by everyone. $LINK is already in our price feed, so this is fairly simple to do.
So with respect to $LINK, what do you think are optimal initial values for:

Collateral factor
Reserve factor
Borrowing limit

Adding LINK as a supported asset New Markets


    As the Open Price Feed already supports LINK, I think we should consider supporting it. LINK has of the highest volume for ERC-20 tokens and has a limited supply cap. I believe it is well suited for being added to Compound.
  

",84,91.8,2021-04-08
['Add Market: LINK'],Incredibly excited about this. LINK seems like a great asset to add to Compound.,82,16.4,2021-04-08
['Add Market: LINK'],"The most recently added markets were cCOMP and cUNI.


Collateral Factor for cCOMP and cUNI are both set to 60%.

~35% of LINK (~$11.3billion USD value) is stored in a closed-source contract which is unknown whether there is a malicious distribution risk (see risk notes later in my post here).
I think we should consider starting cLINK with a low Collateral Factor to help offset this risk.



Reserve Factor for cCOMP and cUNI are both currently at 25% (proposal 31).

Borrow Cap appears to be Token-Specific. I’m not sure what this should be or even if it needs to be set for cLINK market? Need feedback from others on this.

UNI Borrow Cap is currently set to 11.25 Million UNI
COMP Borrow Cap is currently set to 90,750 COMP
The Community MultiSig has power to adjust borrow caps
From the Crypto Briefing article below it seems that LINK is NOT currently used for Chainlink governance. Maybe the borrow cap is less important if there is no voting-power borrow risk?



For the Interest Rate Model, cLINK might want to use the same one used for cCOMP JumpRateModelV2 | 0xd956188795ca6f4a74092ddca33e0ea4ca3a1395 (etherscan.io)

2% APY borrow base rate

Kink at 80% utilization
100% APY borrow rate at 100% utilization
No need to deploy a new IRM contract, just point to this one if using exact same rate parameters,



@jmo from Gauntlet has been doing some risk modeling for Compound. I would love to have some input from Gauntlet for ideas on initial values for these market parameters for adding the LINK token.
Here is the ChainLink Token (LINK) Security Audit Report.
Token Security is important when adding asset markets to Compound. Consider the following from OpenZeppelin Compound Audit.

“if a malicious or poorly-designed token is added to Compound, it could allow someone to steal all funds entrusted to Compound. For example, if anyone can arbitrarily change the totalSupply or account balances of a listed ERC20 token faster than the price oracle can adjust the price, an attacker could use those newly minted tokens as collateral to borrow all Compound assets.”
LINK token audit above shows totalSupply at 1 billion.

The LINK contract code is immutable (no upgrades) and the totalSupply is a hard-coded constant.


How are LINK tokens distributed to users from the total supply? If LINK tokens can be distributed arbitrarily faster than price oracle can adjust that would be a concern. If the distribution is predictable then this is less of a concern.

I do have a security concern about this. ~35% of all LINK (~350million) is owned by a Smart Contract here which does not have its code published on EtherScan!

Contract Address 0x98c63b7b319dfbdf3d811530f2ab9dfe4983af9d | Etherscan (closed-source contract holding 35% of all LINK valued today at ~ $11.3 Billion USD)

If this was distributed all at once or stolen by a malicious actor, it would be enough to take a large chunk of the liquid non-borrowed assets currently in Compound. Collateral Factor for cLINK could help mitigate this. With a 60% CF, this would pose ~$6.78 Billion USD risk. Starting with lower CF for cLINK might be a good idea due to this closed source LINK contract.

See the comment from rleshner in this discussion regarding using Borrow Cap’s on other Compound Markets (WBTC, ETH, etc) to enforce some liquidity safety buffer in each market.


Before adding LINK to Compound, I would love for this smart contract code to be published on EtherScan by the contract writer or other person with access to the code. Maybe someone with Chainlink contacts can push to get that contract code posted on Etherscan?

I think this may be the Chainlink Node Operators incentive pool which appears to be centrally controlled by the company “SmartContract Chainlink Ltd.” Since the company controls these assets they can distribute in any manner they decide.

This risk (an attack or movement of that contract’s LINK into Compound, in order to borrow Compound assets) could be offset by activating borrowing caps for Ether, WBTC, and the other collateral assets (BAT, ZRX, UNI, COMP).",67,48.4,2021-04-08
['Add Market: LINK'],"I like the possibility of using Borrow Caps to help ensure some safety liquidity margin in other Compound Markets (ETH, WBTC, etc). I think Gauntlet had suggested something similar maybe in combination with their thoughts on automated governance parameter adjustments.
I think another easy way to offset some of the risk of possible malicious or just unpredictible massive distribution from that 35% LINK holding contract is to start the cLINK market Collateral Factor lower. This is a parameter that is easy to start at zero or low, but difficult to smoothly reduce later (as we saw with WBTC reduction of CF recently).",65,13.0,2021-04-08
['Add Market: LINK'],I think part of my security concern is related to the central control by the Chainlink company of a massive amount of LINK tokens which at one point was ~ 65% of the 1billion tokens (at the time of ICO). They control several contracts and wallets the largest of which is the 35% one mentioned in my earlier post. Any safety decisions we make when adding LINK to Compound can help limit losses if these Chainlink treasury contracts or wallets become vulnerable to exploit or theft.,66,58.2,2021-04-08
['Add Market: LINK'],"Thanks mistertom for the reply! Non-circulating tokens and the creation of additional tokens were not things I considered before. I’ll think about these sort of attack scenarios and then loop back on this.

['Add Market: LINK'],"@mistertom I think adding LINK with a collateralFactor of 0, like USDT is a good path forward.  Of course, we’ll want to raise that later. This would:

Punt on any concerns with token centralization
Allow the protocol to test if the interest rate model is a good fit for LINK
Give Gauntlet some time to run stress tests and pick collateral requirements for LINK

We can’t commit to anything right now, but I think it would be great to get LINK on the platform in the meantime and start generating revenue with it to demonstrate the value it provides.",66,158.2,2021-04-09
['Add Market: LINK'],If LINK starts with a collateral factor of zero and reserve factor of 25% I think I would be voting “yes.” That would be a super safe way to introduce it and give some time to deliberate on next value for the Collateral Factor while testing out the new market.,64,82.8,2021-04-09
['Add Market: LINK'],"So here’s the current issue with adding new markets as described above.
Some tokens, such as LINK, are highly concentrated in a small number of wallets. These tokens are not in circulation. Price discovery of such token is based upon the circulating supply.
Assuming demand for the token stays the same, a large increase in the circulating supply will likely pull the price of the token down.
Let’s examine the specific case of the Chainlink founders dumping all of their dormant tokens into Compound protocol.
Now, just having LINK sitting in our protocol likely won’t have much of an effect on the price as its still not really circulating. A large amount of LINK would either have to be liquidated or borrowed and then subsequently be sold in exchanges for the price to drop.
Let’s examine large amounts of these dormant tokens being borrowed and sold. This would be a great way to short LINK - borrow a large amount, sell all at market price, then buy back at lower price points. Since Compound requires over-collateralization, this would be costly and risky for a user. We also have a borrowing limit to prevent this. This doesn’t seem like too big of a concern to me.
Now let’s examine a scenario where all of these dormant tokens are used as collateral to borrow WBTC, then eventually all of the LINK tokens are subject to liquidation. Assuming all of the assets are seized, they would then be in the possession of a number of different owners. If these new owners were to sell all of their newly acquired LINK, the price could very well nosedive. This could cause a ripple effect of liquidations where LINK is used as collateral. This is what we want to avoid.
So there’s a clear risk when it comes to the collateralization rate of various tokens.
But this is not just some token, this is a token of one of the largest and most reputable blockchain projects. It’s highly unlikely that the Chainlink founders will perform such an attack. It’s more likely for such an attacker to be someone who’s hacked Chainlink’s Gnosis MultiSig wallet(s). But the risk is still there.
As a solution to this problem in general, we could introduce deposit caps or max collateralizable amounts based on trading volume for a period of time, for each and every market. One of us can make a new proposal for this.
Finally, I’d like to mention this risk isn’t specific to LINK. Such an attack could be performed by whales with any asset.",63,37.6,2021-04-09
['Add Market: LINK'],"I’m supportive of adding LINK, above were my attempts to investigate into the token and see what market parameters we might set to sell voters (and myself) on passing the proposal to add the new market. We need to sell the COMP voting whales on the initial parameters to reach that 400,000 votes needed for the proposal to pass. jmo from Gauntlet above mentioned there were similar central control concerns with adding USDT which resulted in setting the initial CF to zero. Our voters might be more trusting of Chainlink company than Bitfinex (Tether associated company) in which case they could approve initial Collateral Factor above zero. Choosing that initial CF value is a gamble, too high and the token add might fail to pass a vote. If the CF is set low enough I think we can almost guarantee that the proposal to add LINK market will pass and then future proposal to raise the CF can be voted on later with additional trust as users have seen the LINK market in operation.",60,47.0,2021-04-09
['Add Market: LINK'],"Another market parameter that hasn’t been discussed here, COMP distribution rewards for the LINK market. We could start the market out without COMP distributions. I believe when cUNI and cCOMP markets were launched, the COMP distribution was automatically adjusted with the size of each market. Now that COMP distribution rates are set manually, it can cause a mad rush to enter a market which starts empty and receiving a COMP distribution. Take for example the recent “upgrade” of the WBTC market. This created a new empty WBTC market with massive COMP distribution allocated (moved from old WBTC market). Compound users made a mad-rush to enter the new WBTC market to take advantage of the COMP distribution which was very massive for the first few users to enter the market. If we don’t mind this mad-rush then maybe we could set the COMP speed to match cUNI which was set in proposal 35: Comptroller._setCompSpeed(""cUNI"", 1950000000000000). This distributes ~ 25.62 COMP per day to the UNI market split 50/50 between suppliers and borrowers. LINK would be the first market added since manual COMP speeds were implemented other than the WBTC migration.",60,77.0,2021-04-09
['Add Market: LINK'],"I think using the distribution to improve the liqudiity flow into a new contract is great, this helps establish a great liquidity market for borrowers very fast.",57,46.4,2021-04-09
['Add Market: LINK'],"That’s a good point, the COMP distribution helps build up the new market with users quickly. I say we copy the COMP speed from cUNI for this new LINK market.",59,31.8,2021-04-09
['Add Market: LINK'],"we would have to “decrease” some amount from other market and give the decreased amount to the new market, to keep the “same” comp speed in total",60,27.0,2021-04-09
['Add Market: LINK'],"I think there’s a buffer because total comp speeds are less than 0.5 COMP per block coming from the Reservoir. But I guess that other COMP is designated for other protocol purposes (grants, etc).
Which market(s) do you think we should reallocate the COMP Distribution from?

Comptroller compRate is 0.176 * 2 = 0.352 COMP per block (split 50/50 supply/borrow)
Reservoir drip rate is 0.5 COMP per block, the difference is reserved for grants, etc.

Table has been updated with suggested COMP reallocation from rleshner. reallocate from cUNI/cBAT/cZRX to cLINK. My math needs to be double-checked for rounding / floating point errors.

My name is Don. I am a contributor at Index Coop, a DAO with the vision of making crypto investing more accessible and effortless to investors by creating and maintaining the world’s best crypto index products. The Index Coop’s flagship product is the DeFi Pulse Index (DPI), composed of 14 blue-chip DeFi tokens, including Compound. As of this post, the DPI contract holds ~40,000 COMP tokens.
We organized a protocol ambassador program to have more comprehensive updates from the protocols under DPI and actively participate in the governance/forum.
I volunteered to be the protocol ambassador of Compound, and these are the level of involvement you can expect from me:

Attending community-related calls for updates
Actively interacting with forum posts related to Index Coop products

I am a massive fan of COMP because the protocol is crucial for DeFi, and it fueled up the “DeFi summer 2020”.

['Add Flash Loans to the compound protocol'],"
Intoduction
In regular loans, the lender usually wants some kind of collateral to make sure they get their money back; the contract often takes a while to get approved, and the borrower pays back the loan, with interest, over a period of weeks, months or years. Flash loans are the opposite of that. They do what they say on the tin, and occur in an instant because the funds are both borrowed and returned within seconds—in the space of one transaction. If the borrower doesn’t repay the capital, or the trade doesn’t make a profit, the conditions set out in the flash loan smart contract aren’t met, and the transaction is reversed—just like it never happened, with the funds returned to the lender. So—in theory, at least—there’s minimal risk for both parties.

Benefits
There are several benefits in doing so:

Lot of assets become available to flashloan from which makes DeFi ecosystem safer and more robust
Venues for flashloanable assets increase
Compound users earn more interest from fees

['Compound Risk Monitoring'],"This is in response to @PatrickHmmmmm on discord. Patrick asks a few questions.

Hey Wayne, id love to hear more about the idea before I build the account health system
Would like to build a wishlist for people seeking health notifications. Currently scope is to let people opt into email and text warnings when they hit health thresholds of 60%+
And/or when prices reach a trigger level

That sounds like a really great start and trust me I understand scope of work  These are just some ideas that i have that may build on what you have proposed in your grant proposal high level concept. I have not seen the full grant proposal.

I’m also thinking about building some interactive tools for people to see what drops in asset prices will do to their borrow position
What do you want to see on the more systemic side

Let’s say for the moment that we are only talking about market risk that is the risk posed to any account or the system due to the movement of prices. In that case, trad-fi has a deep and rich history that should really be used. That is not to say that they have always been right and in fact they have often been wrong however they learned some very valuable lessons that we should remember.
Here are some “well known” observations from tradfi that are pretty much replicated in crypto in my experience.

When prices are dropping the entire market goes “risk off” and correlations in price movements approach 100%
Empirical scenario analysis is critical to capture these events
The assumption of stable distribution of asset returns is absurd

With this context let us consider what that means for compound accounts and the protocol itself.

Accounts should have the ability to adjust prices and see what that does to their portfolio. This is fully independent scenario analysis. It would be better to use the empirical copula to figure out what a change in price in asset X results in assets Y and Z and … This could be called risk factor scenario analysis. It is a much bigger ask with lots of in-the-weeds practical questions. Another method is called “parametric analysis” where a statistical distribution is attempted to be fit to the asset returns. This is mostly flawed on its face in crypto due to the assumption of “independent and identically distributed asset returns”. There are more complex parametric models that may be cooked up but there are so much empirical data (observations) in crypto that parameterizing is not entirely necessary or even good.
The protocol itself has its own health which is represented as the aggregate of all account health within the protocol. This requires some more detailed writing and thought but on its face is quite obvious. There are likely many in-the-weeds issues that will come up when thinking through the math of how accounts aggregate to risk to the protocol. The most obvious question to ask is under what scenario(s) does the entire protocol become insolvent? The insidious part of this question is that the situation is likely much worse than it appears due to resonant frequency liquidations (liquidations causing more liquidations) and leverage throughout the crypto ecosystem due to high leverage perps available at many exchanges now. In that sense there is likely some significantly higher price where there is a point of no return and further liquidations are inevitable.
There are some assumptions built in here especially around the ability and willingness of a liquidator to liquidate in the presence of parabolic gas costs for example (among many others). Having something that isolates price risk is extremely useful in and of itself however.

In summary I think there are a few things worth looking at here
some easy ones

account health
collateralization ratio of the entire protocol
some measure of “health” of the protocol

some harder ones that can and should be applied at the account level and protocol level

independent price movement scenario analysis
conditional risk factor price movement scenario analysis

Inherited stETH risks: FAQ - Lido Finance

Smart contract security

Open-sourced, audited, and covered by an extensive bug bounty program to minimize risk


ETH 2.0 - Technical risk

ETH 2.0 is still under development and there may be bugs in it which could affect this asset


ETH 2.0 - Adoption risk

If ETH 2.0 adoption is low, there may be significant fluctuations in the value of ETH and stETH


DAO key management risk

Risk of a DAO hack, rogue entities, or loss of access would result in funds becoming locked


Slashing risk

Up to 100% of staked ETH could be at risk. Multiple professional and reputable node operators with heterogeneous setups are used to mitigate this risk.
Insurance paid from Lido fees can partially cover these losses.
Insured by Unslashed Finance


stETH price risk

Exchange price of stETH may be lower than its inherent value due to withdrawal restrictions on Lido.







LIDO Incentives

Interest Rate Model

(people will borrow eth to put into stETH)



Will cETH IRM be able to handle this?


Will comp distribution incentivize a move?

Borrowing/Lending activity between cETH and cstETH
People will borrow ETH to convert to cstETH.
Since the IRM for ETH is linear, the util will max out at around 50% as “arbitrage” disappears as ETH borrow rate meets cstETH supply rate.
To help this, we change IRM so that cETH can adapt to allow investing in cstETH
We will have cstETH IRM be close to what cETH is today, to anchorage long term holding in preparation for ETH 2.0 withdrawals.

Oracle considerations
We have three approaches to how we’ll determine the price of stETH.

Peg stETH to ETH at 1:1. When ETH 2.0 is merged, users will be able to redeem their stETH for EH at a 1:1 ratio. For now, Curve has the most stETH liquidity and the swap ratio is near 1:1.
Wait for ChainLink to create a stETH price feed.
Take the price from Curve.

Solution #1 would be the simplest and most efficient approach, but there is the risk of sETH’s price crashing due to any of the inherint risks of Lido.",47,29.4,2021-06-18
['Add markets: stETH'],"Solution 1 might now work, as if the stETH discount increases beyond the liquidator discount it will not be possible to liquidate stETH backed loans. While stETH hasn’t had more than about 4% discount to date, it seems possible for the discount to grow larger than the 8% liquidator discount in stressed conditions.",46,24.2,2021-06-18
['Add markets: stETH'],"Generally, I think stETH would be a phenomenal asset to add.
The price feed questions could be reduced by using a 0% collateral factor to start, but would have to be answered. If users are only borrowing stETH (but not using it as collateral), a 1:1 peg is somewhat punitive to borrowers–but could be viable. Taking the price from Curve also works (by deploying a new View), but would need to be carefully researched/managed (there have been tons of issues using Curve from less secure protocols).
Let’s make this happen! Thank you @massnomis and @TylerEther for kicking this off ",48,109.6,2021-06-19
['Add markets: stETH'],"Yeah the price oracle question is going to be a fun one to explore. In the meantime a 0cf makes sense. Hopefully now ETH will be borrowed and put into steth, hopefully creating more borrowing power on the ETH market. @rleshner @monet-supply what do you think about the proposed IRM changes?",46,9.2,2021-06-20
['Add markets: stETH'],"@massnomis, I am almost always wishing protocols/exchanges add additional assets. However, I think that adding an asset so closely tied in value to another (ETH, stETH) will open more doors for whales to game the system to obtain more COMP.
Also, once ETH 2.0 launches I see a slew of issues that may surface, not only with the redemption of stETH. Just look at Compound’s previously depreciated assets (still holding ~$130 million worth of assets). Thinking that Compound users will borrow ETH to deposit into Lido for stETH can and more than likely has been done. Just as users have also borrowed ETH to run ETH 2.0 nodes themselves.
If stETH does appear on Compound, I’d recommend the following:

Collateral Factor: 0% -until ETH 2.0 launch
Reserve Factor: 25%
COMP Speed: 0 / day (unless COMP distribution increases)
Borrow Cap: NONE
Supply Cap: 10-20% of currently minted stETH
Price Reporter: Use all price reporters (for analytics) until the collateral factor is modified.

Using a 1:1 ratio to ETH price is a mistake, but as long as the CF remains at 0%, we really don’t have to worry about the price. If stETH price crashes significantly while using 1:1 ratio, then we could see stETH suppliers suddenly borrow up to their max to purposely get liquidated by liquidation bots. That would effectively enable those suppliers to exchange their lower valued stETH into any other asset on Compound. I could also see suppliers being able to leverage this by purchasing more stETH to supply for more collateral than they should have.
BTW, how often does Compound’s price feed get updated? Compound may want to update stETH’s price feed more frequently.",45,9.0,2021-06-21
['Add markets: stETH'],@paraficapital stETH here,43,8.6,2021-06-21
['Add markets: stETH'],"So 0cf, 0 comp speeds. Supply cap is can be implemented by forking CREAM’s ERC20Capable and a comptroller patch, but for now, without incentives and CF, people are less likely to move over to farm, while CRV and LIDO are emitted over at curve.
I talked to @Johann_Eid about chainlink bringing in stETH prices, and its on the way.
I think for now, 1:1 ETH price, 0cf, 0 COMP, until chainlink can support it fully, and at that point we can migrate. This asset will need migration as ETH 2.0 Nears, so getting the ball running should be a good idea.",44,8.8,2021-06-21
['Add markets: stETH'],"the curve pool is massive, Possibly the deepest liquidity on chain out of all assets (not pegged to 1USD). I think that curve pricing alone ~can be enough, because to swing that price will be billions of capital, but possible with a “hack” of sETH over at Synthetix. Since there’s no CEX trading for stETH, curve’s prices are the most accurate. If stETH falls off par, keeping that peg could be an issue, but if its 0cf, then its minimal. with the current proposed conditions, I am all for pushing this forward.",44,8.8,2021-06-21
['Add markets: stETH'],"@massnomis and I have discussed the highly likely scenario of users borrowing ETH, converting to stETH, and depositing again to farm COMP.
Is this good or bad?
A positive argument for this scenario is that Compound will encourage people to start contributing more and more ETH to validate the network, paving the way for a better ETH 2.0 launch.
I’d love to hear more discussion of the pros and cons of this scenario; borrowing ETH, minting stETH, and depositing it back.",42,28.4,2021-06-23
['Add markets: stETH'],Let’s talk about it at the community call tonight?,42,23.4,2021-06-23
['Add markets: stETH'],"The biggest risk here is the discount could potentially get blown out if too many people do this trade. We’ve seen a similar dynamic play out with Grayscale products:

Grayscale trusts like GBTC traded at a premium due to strong investor demand
Prop funds borrowed BTC, sold, and used proceeds to purchase GBTC, this allowed them to earn an implied yield from selling into the premium once the 6-12 month lockup ends
Too many funds put on this same trade, causing the GBTC premium to collapse and even go negative
Funds took a big loss, and apparently some of them defaulted on their BTC loans because the value of GBTC was no longer enough to pay back their debt

This is definitely a valuable opportunity for Compound to make cETH more productive with stable borrowing demand. But certainly not without risk.
Once stETH redemptions are enabled with the ETH2 merge upgrade, this price discount risk will go down considerably. But until then we should be a careful to set an appropriate collateral factor.",41,73.2,2021-06-25

Josh here, governance researcher @ Oxford / Metagov. I’m working with Kevin Werbach (UPenn), Primavera de Filippi (Harvard/CNRS), and Gina Pieters (UChicago) on an industry-wide survey of blockchain governance, and we’d like to invite Compound to participate. Since Compound is collectively-governed, we’d love to see a wiki-style response from the community itself! I’ve created a stub response in this Google doc. Please help us fill it out—it could be as simple as dropping a few links or summarizing a few key governance posts from this forum!
Participating in the assessment will help the community better understand Compound’s governance and how it compares with other major blockchain projects (especially important because a lot of other blockchains have forked Compound’s governance), and help make governance better and more transparent for the entire ecosystem. All data and analysis will be made public at the end of the assessment period.
If you’d like to see what a completed assessment looks like, you can see a bunch of examples here  from projects like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Uniswap, Tezos, etc.

Getty Hill - Asset Listing Update (starts at 1:04)
Getty provided an update on the process of adding additional assets to the Compound Protocol. This discussion involved two proposals, prop 53 and prop 54 [links], which aim to add MKR and AAVE, SUSHI, and YFI, respectively. Each asset will have a 0% collateral factor, a 25% reserve factor, and JumpRateV2 interest rate model . Borrow caps will vary among the assets and are as follows: MKR - 25k, Aave - 60k, yFi - 1.5k. You can read more about the new asset listings on the accompanying forum thread
Arr00 - Address Whitelisting for Governance (starts at 5:20)
Arr00 introduced a feature that would create a whitelist of addresses which could propose improvements. In the status quo, long-standing and trusted contributors are still required to rally 65k COMP tokens in order to propose improvements to the Compound Protocol. Arr00 explains that having a whitelist of addresses voted on by the community would greatly increase the proposal timelines for active protocol developers. As a safeguard, the community multisig would be given the ability to cancel proposals. Additionally, whitelist status will have an expiration date, after which contributors will have to request an extension.
TylerEther - Isolated Markets Oracle  (starts at 9:30)
TylerEther discussed an oracle system which aggregates multiple DEX’s, as a first step in the creation of a permissionless listing of isolated market assets [link]. The current Chainlink oracle system only supports so many assets and pulls prices from Uniswap v2. In order to support a broader range of assets, an oracle is needed which can pull from multiple sources. The proposed oracle could pull from Uniswap v1, v2, v3, and Sushiswap. Tyler is continuing work on the oracle to streamline efficiency and reduce associated gas fees. While isolated markets are still a work in progress, questions from Getty and Robert revealed that the high level view would reflect a similar asset pair lending/borrowing scheme as employed by Uniswap and Sushiswap.

_neo - Tiramisu’s Compound Integration (starts at 15:20)
_neo discussed a wallet application called Tiramisu that won an award at the recent HackMoney Hackathon. Tiramisu offers a digital wallet for individuals to store their local currency as USDC. This USDC is then automatically lent out on the Compound protocol. These funds are always available and constantly growing at a rate far higher than traditional bank offerings. Additionally, Tiramisu has a built-in payment layer allowing users to spend directly from their Tiramisu wallet using IPFS and QR codes. More information about Tiramisu can be found in the whitepaper.
Max0x - Backd’s Compound Integration (starts at 20:50)
Max0x announced the upcoming launch of Backd in mid-August. Backd will be integrated for liquidation protection for Compound users. Borrowers will be able to earn yield while protecting their loans from liquidation. Borrowers will also be able to increase leverage and post less collateral on their loans all while continuing to mitigate their liquidation risk. Max0x also believes that the Backd integration will bring a new way for Compound users to leverage or hedge their assets. Backd does this with its novel ‘reactive liquidity pools’ which react to user’s positions and market conditions. Participants will earn Backd governance token rewards and can register their Compound loans to be topped up when the loan to collateral ratio reaches customizable risk parameters. Deeper explanations can be found on their website or on their fact sheet.
Allthecolors - Should Compound Retroactively Airdrop Tokens to Early Users? (starts at 29:55)
Allthecolors continued an ongoing discussion on a very popular forum discussion, “Should Compound retroactively airdrop tokens to early users?”. As part of the third round of Compound grants, allthecolors worked to compile a list of early users and sum their total interest earned or borrowed. He described a variety of developments he and additional community members have been exploring including: potential distribution shape parameters, implementation of a proposal to governance, and mechanisms which could power a safe distribution of tokens.  Arr00 raised the concern that the discussion is centering around how to distribute tokens before the discussion around if the distribution should take place has been decided.  Allthecolors explained that the developments do not presume the proposal will pass but simply aims to add options for debate should the community decide to proceed.

['Remove cCOMP borrow cap'],"Proposal: remove the borrow cap on the cCOMP market.
On last Wednesday’s Community Call (I tried and failed to record the call…next time) we discussed removing the cCOMP borrow cap of 100k COMP. The borrow cap was originally put into place to prohibit someone from using the market to borrow COMP, create a governance proposal, vote, and return the capital in seconds. After the upgrade to Governor Bravo and the installation of a review period, the governance process is significantly more cost-prohibitive for a borrower to obtain the necessary votes to meet the proposal threshold. As well, the review period gives users 48-hours to position their COMP holding for a vote, unlike Governor Alpha which used an instantaneous voting system. If a malicious user were to borrow the required COMP to meet the proposal threshold the community would have sufficient time to defeat their proposal.
Removing the borrow cap will help the COMP market develop. Trading firms (onchain and offchain) utilize money markets like Compound and Aave in their systems to borrow assets and particularly ones that are not abundant in supply in traditional borrow/lend services like BlockFi, Genesis, Nexo, and Celsius. It is helpful for everyone if spot and futures markets are efficient.
Next Steps: Changing the borrow cap does not require a traditional governance proposal since caps are controlled by the community multisig. The multisig holders follow the direction of the community. Below is a 7-day poll for removing the borrow cap on the cCOMP market. If you vote “YES” you think the borrow cap should be removed. If you vote “NO” you do not think the borrow cap should be removed. If the poll revolves to “YES” after the 7-day period the multisig holders will remove the borrow cap.

['Remove cCOMP borrow cap'],"I think removing the borrow cap is a great idea! As it stands now, a few users are earning excessive COMP rewards through farming the cCOMP market, and the borrow cap prevents additional borrowers from helping the market reach equilibrium.
Couple comments on the governance process to support this change:

Discourse forum polls are naturally vulnerable to sybil attacks (anyone can create an account and sway the vote). Selecting the “show who voted” option and changing “show results” option to “on vote” can help with this, as it will be easy to identify new accounts with no forum activity and disregard their vote. You can also use the “limit voting to these groups” option and select trust levels 1-4, which excludes trust level 0 (newly created accounts with less than 10 minutes of read time). Adding an abstain option is also nice, it lets people see the results even if they don’t want to sway the outcome of the vote.

The vote can also be held in the Compound Snapshot space. Power over borrow caps is already delegated to the community multisig so a snapshot vote isn’t strictly necessary, but it offers a more objective view of tokenholder support versus forum polls.

['Remove cCOMP borrow cap'],"I wanted to bump this thread because I think it is an ongoing thorn in Compound’s side. Currently cCOMP borrow has a yield -7.36% and due to the borrow limit, this market is well outside the bounds of its natural equilibrium. The unique part about cCOMP market is that the supplemental distribution is paid in its native asset. While this is obvious, the implication is that this market should be the most efficient at reaching market equilibrium because its yield has zero-price risk (assuming adequate collateral), unlike other markets where there is COMP price risk that must be accounted for.
The major risk at play in this discussion is a malicious actor borrowing large amounts of COMP and then making and/or voting on proposals that may not be in the best long-term interest of the protocol. The borrow CAP is our main deterrent from this sort of actor and in a functioning market, an increasing interest rate would also act as such.
The following are the options I have considered to fix this market: Increase Borrow Cap, Raise Interest Rates, Remove/Lower COMP Distribution
Increase Borrow CAP:
Increasing the COMP borrow cap could help to mitigate the issue, however there is still a risk that we hit the new borrow cap immediately and are in the same situation. See below for the analysis… For the increased borrow cap to allow for positive borrow yield in excess of the supply yield, the CAP would have to be increased to a value far greater than the community might be comfortable with.
If you look at our current situation (~100k COMP Borrow CAP), in order to achieve a net zero interest rate, we will need the supply to decrease by roughly 5x to achieve a utilization ratio of ~80%.
An increase in Borrow CAP to 150k COMP would still require the amount of COMP to supplied to decrease in order to have a net zero interest rate.
An increase to 200k COMP would be able to achieve market equilibrium (as per my definition) assuming no change in COMP supplied. Additionally, the supply net interest rate at the breakeven point (~1.1 million COMP) would be ~1.36% which is far less than the current 2.98%. Essentially, it is unlikely that the supply will grow to levels that cause the borrow rate to go negative because the interest rate will be far too low to support that value.

Raise Interest Rates:
One relatively simple fix that I have not seen mentioned is simply increasing interest rates on the cCOMP token. The only parameter I would suggest changing is the 0% utilization rate, due to the already high interest rate model of cCOMP. However, this “fix” will not effect any real change in alleviating the issue at hand unless it is done in tandem with one of the other solutions.
Remove/Lower COMP Distribution:
This is by far the easiest fix, as setting the distribution to zero would fix all issues immediately. However, this is probably not ideal since the entire point of distributing COMP is to reward the users of the protocol and incentivize activity.
Conclusion:
I propose that the cCOMP borrow CAP be increased to 200k COMP. The additional 100k COMP does pose a risk to the protocol in that a malicious actor could create a proposal with that borrowing but is enough to have meaningful influence on its passage. This activity is mitigated by allowing the cCOMP market to achieve a net positive borrow rate (by making the malicious attack costly). 200k COMP Borrow at the current supply of ~550,000 COMP would result in a net borrow rate of ~6.9% (12.91% Borrow Rate - 6.00% COMP Distr.). While this rate is not exorbitantly expensive, it is better than a negative rate and has a real economic cost if amount borrowed reaches the CAP. Having properly functioning markets, especially for the protocol’s governance token, is very important for Compound’s long-term success.
What does everyone think? Do any additional scenarios need to be explored? If we can achieve consensus on the forum, we could try to enact this change in the AAVE,SUSHI,etc market addition proposal that is upcoming from @getty and team.",23,14.6,2021-07-27

    Greetings. 
Its been a few months since I have last spoken about cCOMP and the oddities that the market contains. 
While originally I came into this topic hoping to make some quick and sharp changes regarding either the interest rate parameters, borrow cap, or even the cfactor. But as it usually is, hastily made decisions don’t always hold the most predictable consequences. 
This journey led me to learn about what it really means to be your own bank, the difference between stealing and being edu…
  

I already did a report on this, got a grant for it, written a handful of forum posts, voted on the forum, voted on snapshot, talked about this at basically every call, I am beat.
If someone wants to sponsor a prop, so be it, but take a look at who historically has borrowed comp, this is an uphill battle and a painful situation for me personally, governance as a whole and individual contributors.
Hopefully a multisig to control reserve factors and borrow caps will be in place, but the current multisig wont touch the borrow caps after all this, so be it.

['Using the 2.8% seize fee for B.Protocol backstop automatic market maker (B.AMM)'],"(Disclosure, I am the founder of B.Protocol)
Recently our community introduced a novel automated market maker algorithm that can handle liquidation of big amounts, and has automatic rebalance procedure.
We are proposing that compound protocol would deposit funds (potentially from the 2.8% seize fee) into a deployed contract of the system, which will offer all supported compound debts with 4% discount (over compound’s oracle).
Further, the contract will only support liquidations over compound.
After each liquidation, an automatic rebalance process will start.
Such setup will guarantee that if X amount of token C is deposited, then liquidations of up to X amount of C token are guaranteed to succeed, even if all of defi liquidity is temporarily drained.
Offering liquidity with 4% discount give some room to incentivise callers to the liquidation function. And fee that is being charged during the rebalance process.

More about the B.AMM
The backstop automatic market maker (B.AMM) serves as a buffer of liquidity, and offer liquidity with premium (e.g., 4%) over market price (where the market price is determined according to chainlink price feed).
Once a liquidity is taken, the buffer position becomes imbalanced, and it offer the imbalanced inventory for sale, with discount over market price.
Where the market price is again determined by chainlink oracle, and the the actual discount is determined by a smart contract formula, which takes into account the inventory imbalance.
The authors of the whitepaper performed a simulation on how it would perform. The benchmark was set to be Binance futures USD-ETH market. Which had $1B of liquidations that month.
The figure below shows liquidations where the y axis units are 100 million USD, and the x axis is time in 30 minutes resolution

The whitepaper assumes certain delay in the DeFi liquidity recovery time, and shows how much will be needed to cover such volume of liquidations

Further, it assumes 5% premium, and shows that overall, in the month of April 2021, this strategy could have been profitable

['Using the 2.8% seize fee for B.Protocol backstop automatic market maker (B.AMM)'],"Backstop liquidity providers are key participants in the CeFi world. It’s great to see that B.Protocol takes this initiative to build a protocol for providing backstop liquidity for lending protocols in DeFi. In the forum post, B.Protocol proposed that Compound protocol can deposit a fraction (2.8%) of the liquidation seized amount to the B.protocol contracts as the backstop liquidity, instead of adding it to the cToken reserves (acts as insurance for protocol insolvency and owned by COMP holders).
The whitepaper outlines the details of B.AMM liquidations mechanics. However, some open questions need to be clarified.


Backstop liquidity asset composition
The post suggests that Compound can deposit a fraction of the liquidation seized assets to B.AMM. However, most of the seized assets are volatile collateral assets. If this proposal is implemented, the majority of the assets deposited from Compound don’t directly help provide backstop liquidity since most of the assets in the pools are not borrow assets. Is there any built-in “portfolio rebalance” mechanism to ensure that the assets are mainly composed of the borrow assets? According to the whitepaper, the current rebalance mechanism is only for selling liquidation seized collateral assets.

Pooling user funds to Uniswap V2
The whitepaper mentions that “Pool user funds at a yield-bearing platform, e.g., Uniswap V2”. Based on the description, COMP token holders who technically own the reserve implicitly take the impermanent loss risk of being a Uniswap v2 liquidity provider. How do COMP token holders express the level of the risk they want to take? Or what yield-bearing platform/asset pairs to integrate with?

Incentive for bite transaction
The whitepaper mentions that “a bite transaction can be invoked by anyone”. What’s the incentive for a user to execute a bite transaction?
",16,78.2,2021-07-22
['Using the 2.8% seize fee for B.Protocol backstop automatic market maker (B.AMM)'],"Thanks a lot for taking the time to read the whitepaper and respond.
Before replying to the specific questions, I would like to emphasize that B.Protocol indeed aims to build a more efficient backstop for DeFi lending platforms that will improve capital efficiency of lending platforms.
However, the current proposal/idea is very narrow focused in its scope. Typically we offer projects to fully rely on B.Protocol for the liquidation process, and offer better capital efficiency (i.e. collateral factor) to the users. Here we simply suggest to use our developed technology only with the emergency funds without any change in the core Compound protocol.



 inkymaze:

Backstop liquidity asset composition


The B.AMM technology do not offer any novelty for simple portfolio rebalance. However such rebalance by its nature could be semi-manual. E.g., via a governance portfolio committee. Either way, it seems like this issue should be addressed by the Compound community even if the funds are not deposited at the B.AMM (as it is better not to hold the emergency funds in volatile assets).



 inkymaze:

Pooling user funds to Uniswap V2


Uniswap is just an example, and in this case maybe just depositing the funds to compound is the most natural thing to do.



 inkymaze:

Incentive for bite transaction


This is a valid question. New protocols like liquity.org and MakerDAO liquidation 2.0 offer such incentives, and those could be used also in compound (e.g, offer 0.5% of liquidation size to the tx invoker, and this can be done in the B.AMM, outside of Compound’s core protocol).
There are also automated serviced such as Keep3r, Chainlink keeper, and Gelato that could also help ensuring such txs are invoked.
Moreover I would argue that to some extent, as in the absence of B.Protocol those funds were meants to seat idle anw, a missed liquidation is not necessarily a risk, as it would be missed also with the current status quo.
Nevertheless I do believe it is only a matter of time before DeFi protocols would decouple the trading incentive in liquidations from the tx invocation incentives, and this seems to be the new norm.",15,48.0,2021-07-23
['repayBorrow() with cToken'],"Problem
USDT, USDC, WBTC, and TUSD* are all pausable tokens. This means a central admin can pause them at any time, halting all transfers. When a token is paused, it will be bad news for Compound users on both sides. Depositors will be unable to withdraw their underlying token, and borrowers will be stuck with their collateral locked, since they cannot repay their loan.
*TUSD could be paused with an implementation upgrade.
Idea
Let’s add a new repayBorrow function that allows repayment with the correct amount of cToken rather than the underlying. With this in place, when a token is paused we can expect a market to develop for the cToken (e.g. on Uniswap). Depositors will now be able to exit their position by simply selling their cToken. And borrowers will be able to exit theirs by buying the cTokens and using the new repayBorrow function.
Another minor benefit: COMP farmers who borrow and lend the same token will be able to exit their positions more easily.
This would be a major improvement to the platform, giving users much more confidence in using a pausable token on Compound. In fact, this change will create an entirely new reason to hold cTokens: they’ll be transferable and there’ll be a market for them even when the underlying token is paused! This could be a major draw for folks who otherwise hold large balances of a pausable token.

['repayBorrow() with cToken'],"A token gets paused when the owner on the smart contract for the token calls the pause() function. They can do this at any time at their own discretion. To my knowledge, there has not yet been a high profile token that has called pause(), but it’s a matter of “when”, not “if”. I think the most likely scenario where we’d see it happen is when a stablecoin, such as Tether, loses its peg. It would make a lot of sense for the controlling organization to call pause() in an attempt to halt a hysteria of sales causing further depreciation relative to the peg target (dollar).
It’s surprising how few realize this is possible. In much the same way, few realize that Tether has the ability to blacklist any user and freeze their funds, which they’ve already used to freeze about $50m.",27,5.4,2021-07-14
['repayBorrow() with cToken'],"I really support this initiative.
I’ve had a problem with pausable tokens elsewhere. SingularityNET paused their token (AGI) and replaced it with a new token (AGIX), bricking my TokenSets set.
If Compound were to support that token, I could have wrapped AGI in cAGI so that I wouldn’t have to worry about pausable tokens bricking my set, as well as getting interest on the asset.
If Compound were to implement this change, I could see liquidity pools developing on DEXs for the reasons already outlined. It’d be safer for the end-user not to have to worry about getting restricted or blocked by the admins of pausable tokens.
Side note: We could create rewards pools for people who provide liquidity to DEXs to further develop cToken markets.",26,65.2,2021-07-14
['repayBorrow() with cToken'],"I like this idea. It’s so natural that had it been included in the protocol at the start we wouldn’t give it another thought.
Back when we were discussing whether to include WBTC as an asset, there was concern about infinite minting and pausing of WBTC. I proposed a wrapped version (wWBTC) as a way to enable a supply cap (by limiting the amount of wWBTC that could be minted) and to insulate against pauses. But that added a undesired layer of complexity. I don’t think it occurred to us that cWBTC could provide the pause protection on its own.
I would extend the current proposal to also add a new liquidateBorrow() method that accepts CTokens as the repaid asset. That would allow liquidations to proceed as designed even if the repaid underlying is paused, so long as there is a liquid market for the CTokens. I expect that anything serious enough to trigger a pause would be accompanied by volatile market conditions, so it’s important that the liquidation system continues to operate in that scenario.",24,64.8,2021-07-15
['repayBorrow() with cToken'],"This makes sense to me. It also has the added benefit that deleveraging when liquidity in a given market is squeezed (e.g., Dai during Black Thursday) is a little simpler. It essentially allows the balance sheet to be changed in a more direct way that is not as constrained by the tight liquidity (but has the same end effects collateral-wise).
Not necessarily a downside to this per se, but it’s worth further considering that if these tokens were ever paused, Compound would face significant collateral value risk. May want to have floating oracle prices for these tokens (vs. taking the prices of the asset they wrap) since a paused token shouldn’t be worth as much as the raw asset itself. And also consider how liquidations would work on these collateral types.",22,24.4,2021-07-18

Since the function is essentially a concatenation of redeemFresh() and repayBorrowFresh(), there is a lot of repeated code.

I agree with @pyggie–it seems natural to also include a function for liquidation with cTokens. I haven’t written this yet but I’ll do so soon.
Now @aklamun you make a very good point. The Comptroller uses a fixed value of $1 for USDT, USDC, and TUSD, which could lead to many problems. I think your idea to switch them to floating oracles is so good that I made a separate thread for it.",20,24.0,2021-07-19

Single-Sided Exposure: LPs can provide liquidity to a pool with single-sided exposure, either in an ERC20 token (“TKN”) or in BNT.
Impermanent Loss Insurance: Impermanent Loss Insurance accrues over time, by 1% each day, until 100% protection is achieved after 100 days in the pool. There is a 30-day cliff, which means that if a liquidity provider decides to withdraw their position before 30 days passes, they’d incur the same IL loss experienced in a normal, unprotected AMM. If an LP withdraws any time after 100 days, they receive 100% compensation for any loss that occurred in the first 100 days, or anytime thereafter.

If the Bancor DAO approves Liquidity Mining rewards then single sided LPs in the COMP pool will also get BNT in addition to fees (payed in COMP) generated from trading in the pool.",28,150.6,2021-07-12

['Grant to Develop a Futures Market DEX for cTokens (Convexity)'],"Hello, everyone! My name is Leo and I’m an ex-FX swap and interest rate derivatives trader.
I am applying for a $50k grant to build a decentralised exchange for cToken futures. The grant will go towards set up costs and attorney fees.
A cToken future is new kind of interest rate derivative that is a cash settled non-deliverable forward that also creates a fixed versus floating exposure to the Compound Supply Rate of any given market.
The first set of problems that this product will solve is enabling fixed rate deposits and stable rate borrowing using the existing Compound liquidity pools. The stable rate borrowing in this context is different from AAVE’s stable rate borrowing, because there is no risk of the rate being reset. However, if the utilisation ratio on average realises at a region that implies a wider spread between the supply rate and borrow rate, the borrower would be under-hedged.
The second problem that this product will solve is by creating a hedge instrument for crypto interest rates. As the market develops, my hypothesis is that overall level of crypto interest rates will become move correlated across protocols and CeFi lenders. With that assumption, an interest rate derivative that references the Compound Supply rate will move around with the general level of crypto interest rates, and therefore serve as a hedge instrument.
Our team have built a proof of concept demonstrating one of the use cases (fixed rate deposits). It is only deployed on a local blockchain so I’m happy to host a demo and discuss what we’ve built so far. We are currently a team of 4 people (all met online) and have signed up for the HackMoney hackathon and plan on building a minimum viable product over the next 3 weeks. Concurrently I would like to push forward with making this idea a reality.

What are some negative effects of your idea?",38,12.6,2021-06-16
['Grant to Develop a Futures Market DEX for cTokens (Convexity)'],"Hello CryptoCraig! Thanks for your reply.
It seems like every day I find out about a new team that is working on something similar. I guess that just shows that there is a collective awareness in the community that there is a need for such a solution. There are probably about a dozen or more teams out there doing something to do with interest rates - whether tokenising them or creating interest rate swap markets in CLOB or AMM.
I think the biggest benefit to Compound is that it enables fixed rate deposits and stable rate borrowing. This is a feature unavailable in Compound right now. I’m sure a lot of people are happy with floating rates, but there probably are some who would rather have the option for fixed rates.
I don’t really know how these money markets are going to develop over time. However, I think it is in the interest of COMP holders and the Compound community to support an interest rate derivative market that references the Compound markets because it creates another class of use cases. For example, if there was an active derivative market in Compound, it is possible that you could have crypto bond issuances referencing Compound supply rates (e.g. a 2 yr bond that pays Compound rate + 1% or something like that) In that case, both the bond issuer and investor could use derivatives to augment their exposures. But then again, this is DeFi, maybe people don’t want such exposure to a benchmark. Maybe a benchmark like LIBOR only has utility in a world where figuring out an appropriate interest rate for a loan was too cumbersome. I have no idea.
Negative effects - I don’t know. There is definitely a risk of manipulation of the markets if the derivative markets grows sufficiently large. According to DeFi Protocols for Loanable Funds by Gudgeon et al, a handful of addresses dominate the liquidity supplied to the market. They would have an outsized impact on the Compound rate fixings so they may be tempted to put on a huge sized derivative position and withdraw liquidity to benefit from the derivatives.",36,62.2,2021-06-16

['Grant to Develop a Futures Market DEX for cTokens (Convexity)'],"Hi Leo.  I’m curious about the specifications of this fixed rate product you have created.  Since there are many times tradFi products can be created differently (and potentially better) in DeFi, I have a possible solution to suggest.  Correct me if I am wrong in my understanding of cTokens, but when you look at the protocol math, the utilization ratio referenced is always the previous block.  If you took the utilization ratio from t-7days (or however many blocks that would be) you could create  cToken that has known utilization ratio (thus an implied borrow/lending rate) for the next 7 days.  It would be dynamic, but since its able to be calculated for the next 7 days it would be “stable”.
The creation of this token would require that being able to referencing a more distant utilization ratio instead of the previous block is trivial.  This would be its own market (e.g. cUSDC-7Day) and would reference its own utilization ratio, not the next block protocol.  Collateral and liquidation could function exactly the same as the current markets without issue.
Building out a yield curve within the DeFi space will be an important milestone in the evolution of these markets and having a novel framework for interest rates could positively differentiate our protocol.  You can think of this set up as either looking back at earlier rates or that the current utilization is determining future rates.  This “stable” rate would only be stable for borrowers, not for lenders.  Interest paid to lenders is implied from the interest rate for borrowers and the total borrowed amount.  If the future rate is going known to be high, borrowers may pay off their debt leading to a high interest rate for the borrowers remaining but the interest paid to the lenders would be lower if all  lenders remained in the market.  Lenders would quickly leave for greener pastures and a new equilibrium would be reached.  Price Discovery",23,9.6,2021-07-08

['Acala x Compound Chain - Gateway to Polkadot'],"tl;dr: Acala wants to build a Starport on Acala as a gateway into the Polkadot ecosystem. The purpose of this post is to share our proposal and receive feedback from the community.
Introduction
Acala pioneered the idea and implementation of a full-stack (Substrate + EVM) specialized blockchain focusing on decentralized finance (DeFi), and created multiple DeFi primitives that became a DeFi hub and infrastructure serving the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem: multi-collateralized stablecoin using DOT and cross-chain assets like BTC, integrated liquidation process using Off-chain workers and a hybrid of built-in AMM and auctions, tokenized staked assets e.g. Liquid DOT (LDOT), and bring-your-own-gas where fees are payable in any supported assets like stablecoins.
Polkadot is a layer-0 protocol that merely provides shared PoS security and cross-chain communication for its connected parachains. Other chain-specific and application-specific logic, such as EVM and smart contracts, are implemented on parachains. Acala’s parachain plays the role of DeFi hub and a landing pad that aggregates assets and liquidity from a variety of blockchains.
Acala is a firm believer and a long-term builder for the multi-chain future - reducing liquidity fragmentation, increasing composability and DeFi accessibility to everyone, and sharing the same vision as the Compound Chain/Gateway. The Acala team has been building on and contributing to the Substrate code-base for 2+ years, and therefore would like to contribute to Compound Chain’s effort by deploying Acala Starport as a gateway into the Polkadot ecosystem, making such Starport implementation also available to all Polkadot parachains, and providing tooling to read events from and to both chains.
Proposal

Acala Starport1852×1044 177 KB

Acala would like to propose the following:
#1 Deploy Acala Starport as the gateway into the Polkadot Ecosystem
Acala will deploy Starport as a Substrate pallet, whereby all assets are downloadable to the Starport will be available to all DeFi protocols available on Acala, in the Acala EVM useable by smart contracts, cross-chain capable with Polkadot and its parachains, and later available in Ink!. Acala will also contribute to extend and make the events and offchain workers more generic for varied blockchains.
We will integrate the Polkadot{js} extension which is the predominant signer/wallet for the Polkadot Ecosystem to the Compound Cash Dashboard. We will also integrate the Compound-Acala service into the Acala DApp and/or the mobile app via Polkawallet.
All of the Acala Starport code would be generic enough to be adopted by any parachains and Substrate-based chains for that matter, with a goal to accelerate the innovation for bridging more cross-chain assets together.
#2 New collateral asset: DOT
We’d like to propose DOT as a new collateral asset on Compound Chain. DOT can be trustlessly transferred between Polkadot Relay Chain and the Acala parachain via Cross-chain Message Passing (XCMP). Polkadot Relay chain keeps the DOT balances of each parachain, and the balances are updated when a transfer happens between the Relay chain and a parachain, as well as between parachains, all trustlessly. Since Polkadot Relay chain does not host any logic (smart contracts or pallets) other than those essential to a Relay chain, namely PoS consensus and cross-chain communication, DOT uploaded to Compound Chain will have to be done on a parachain. Shared Protected Runtime Execution Enclaves (SPREE), which is on Polkadot’s roadmap (later the year), will add another level of security guarantee to this.
Acala’s source code has been audited and any new features will also be audited before launching on mainnet. Acala’s governance is managed on-chain for both voting and execution. We employ delayed execution for runtime upgrades and parameter changes on-chain. Monitoring can be easily set up to alert any suspicious behaviors as another added layer of protection for DOT integrity.
#3 New collateral asset: Liquid DOT (LDOT)
In addition to DOT, we’d like to propose another native asset as collateral on Compound Chain - Liquid DOT (LDOT). LDOT ****is the tokenized staked DOT (similar to DAI-and-cDAI) bearing Polkadot’s staking yield. Polkadot’s economy has a targeted staking ratio of 50%, parachain bonding of about 30%, and the remainder is liquid. With an average staking yield of 20% APY, DOT is relatively expensive to be used directly in DeFi. And one also would not want to sacrifice network security for yield farming.
Therefore Acala created the Liquid Staking protocol that allows users to trustlessly stake DOT, and use the tokenized staked DOT, LDOT, in trading, borrowing, lending and other DeFi activities. We believe with its trustless and yield-bearing nature, LDOT would be a quality and popular addition to the Compound Chain collateral set.
#4 Download CASH and a potential fee token
Once CASH is downloaded to the Acala Starport pallet, it would immediately be plugged into Acala’s DeFi protocols, e.g. listed in AMM DeX, and also be cross-chain capable via cross-chain consensus (XCM) to the Polkadot Relay Chain and other connected parachains. Acala will also make CASH available as a pre-compiled ERC20 contract readily composable in the EVM.
Beyond that, we also propose to make CASH a native fee token on Acala. With pooled peer-blockchain-assets-to-protocol liquidity, the interest-bearing CASH can be expected to be a popular asset that users would hold and use to pay for things. It’s a great usability booster for CASH users to transact on Acala without the need to hold Acala/Polkadot native assets.
Motivation
Polkadot is a layer-0 blockchain scalability solution that provides network security as a service (“shared security”) and trustless cross-chain communication as a service to all parachains connected to it. Each parachain can be customized and optimized for its domain (i.e. Acala is optimized for DeFi), and many DApps (in the form of Substrate pallet or smart contract or both) can be deployed on each parachain.
Acala aims to democratize finance and make DeFi more accessible to everyone with a full-stack chain to DApp approach to delivering the user experience that would not otherwise possible. Acala’s suite of DeFi products has gained significant traction through its slick DApp design and native mobile experience via Polkawallet (a founding member of Acala, Polkawallet has 45,000+ installs and a recognized tool by Polkadot). Acala’s live testnet (TC5) has 50,000+ new accounts, and 780,000+ signed extrinsics (See Subscan) with a large and ever-growing community. Acala has completed three security audits from Trail of Bits, SRLabs and Slow Mist. As soon as parachain slots become available on Polkadot, Acala is ready to launch mainnet.
Compound is one of the most respected and established protocols in DeFi, serving many users and as a DeFi primitive to many other protocols on Ethereum. Compound Chain is a significant step towards serving a much wider audience by bridging together digital assets from a variety of blockchains. Therefore it is beneficial to all three ecosystems for us to bring Compound’s service to the wider Polkadot ecosystem through Acala’s parachain.
The Acala team is one of the earliest Substrate Builders, members of the team (e.g. @xlc) are also top contributors (outside of Parity) to the Substrate code-base. Not only would we deliver high-quality code and products, we will also make the code generic enough to be applicable for all parachains and Substrate-based chains for that matter. We have done this before - we are the creator of the open-runtime-module-library  - a community repo that includes a set of common-good pallets to accelerate application development on Substrate. We have also pioneered XCM implementation for fungible tokens which has been adopted by many parachains testing on Rococo (Polkadot’s parachain testnet).
We can’t wait to make this happen!

Could you please provide more details on how each milestone would benefit Compound and its community? I think it’s important for the community to know exactly how it stands to benefit from the work you propose to do.

Are there challenges that you know of today that would make it difficult for you to achieve these milestones on time (e.g., challenges with R&D, lack of FT resources)? It’s important to list out these difficulties in advance for two reasons: (i) acknowledging them ahead of time makes it easier to prepare for the challenges, and (ii) perhaps Compound’s community can help with these challenges.

I also agree with @inkymaze on the funding process. If the grants proposal passes and you apply for a grant, I do think it makes sense to apply for new grant each time a new milestone is met. For example, you could apply for a $10-$30k grant upfront to give you the resources to get started, and then apply for further grants as milestones are delivered.
For full transparency, I should also mention that I invested in Acala while I was at DCG. I know and respect the team, and I believe they can deliver what they say they will deliver.

To answer your questions re benefits


#1 Develop Acala Starport pallet
This will essentially bridge Compound Chain and Polkadot, allowing accepted Polkadot assets to be uploaded to Compound Chain as collaterals, and allowing CASH to be downloaded and used in Polkadot ecosystem. Polkadot in itself is layer-0, so it relys on parachains to deploy business logics like bridging and smart contract executions etc. Acala as the DeFi hub parachain offers a set of DeFi primitives such as stablecoin lending, AMM DeX and liquid staking, and therefore provides good asset variety and liquidity as a Starport to Compound.


#2  Develop Offchain Worker & Message Passing
This will essentially allow any Substrate-based chain be able to bridge to the Compound Chain. This is certainly a common-good development that will enable many subsequent bridges to Compound Chain, although each Starport deployment will still subject to governance, the barrier of deployment is significantly lowered.


#3 Integration & Oracle
This will ensure Compound Cash App works seamlessly with Acala to bring new assets (e.g. DOT and LDOT) on as collaterals, so as to download CASH to Acala. I can foresee this milestone can be broken down further to add economic and risk analysis for each new collaterals namely DOT and LDOT, and set up the initial parameters so as ongoing monitoring and adjustment procedure.


#4 integrating Compound Cash into Acala Dapps
This essentially exposes the Compound Chain money market services to the Acala (and therefore Polkadot) users and community. In addition, integrating CASH into Acala DApps, using it to pay for transaction/gas fees will further the demand and utility of this new asset. We believe this will result in a positive trickle-up effect for the three communities: Compound, Acala and Polkadot.


To answer your questions re challenges
As we are one of the earliest and most experienced Substrate development teams, and after a thorough study of Compound Chain’s source code, we don’t foresee technical challenges. We do however anticipate potential challenges in setting up a brand new collateral asset class (DOT and LDOT). We will likely need help from experts like Gaunlet and the Labs team to help profile the new assets; in addition, we also need help to bootstrap initial liquidity - we can come up with liquidity programs, but it’s likely that it’d need support from multi-parties to make it work effectively.
Other than that, in order to add CASH as a fee token on Acala, which would be a great use case of CASH and benefits the Compound community, we will need help to add CASH liquidity to our AMM DeX which is used as a unified fee settlement layer. Again we can come up with liquidity programs, it’s likely to be an effort of multi-parties.
Re the grants program
We’re open to the suggestions and would also like to have a further discussion to learn more about the grants program. We’ll report back once having a chat with you.

CC: @sukernik from the grants team

Milestone 1 Starport Pallet
This delivery includes

Support lock to upload asset
Support execTrxRequest to execute transaction request on Compound Chain （this is done on the Compound Chain side, on Acala chain, we just need to support the notice arrived #3 )
Support invoke to execute notices from Compound Chain
Necessary Governance features

Which essentially enables the following features

Upload Acala chain assets e.g. DOT, LDOT via the Starport to Compound Chain
Download Compound Chain assets e.g. Compound CASH to the Acala chain via Gateway Notice
Preliminary administrative functions such as setting supply cap, setting authorities to verify Gateway Notices etc.


Local Testnet
Live testnet integration won’t be available until Milestone #3 is delivered. Currently you can try the above features via Acala local testenet.
Here’s the code & the guide.

Next Step
Milestone #2 is about cross-chain communication, specifically between the Compound Gateway Substrate chain and the Acala Substrate chain.
There are multiple options available to achieve this, including using Cross-chain Message Passing developed by the Parity team, alternatively using off-chain query service like Subquery and potentially other options. There were numerous exchanges between the two dev teams to finalize the design.
In addition, here’s a list of open issues.
Will report back as we progress further.

['repayBorrow with cTokens'],"Background
USDT, USDC, and WBTC are all pausable tokens*. A single authority can call pause() at any time, halting all transfer of the token. If a token is paused, it’s bad news for Compound users on both sides. Depositors cannot withdraw their underlying and borrowers are unable to repay, leaving their collateral locked.
*TUSD is upgradable, and a pause function could be added.
Idea
Add a new repayBorrow function that allows repayment with the cToken rather than the underlying. Then when a token is paused a market will develop for the cToken (e.g. on Uniswap). Depositors can now exit position by selling their cToken. And borrowers can now exit by buying the cToken and using the new repayBorrow function. An additional benefit is that folks lending/borrowing the same token for COMP farming could more easily exit their position.
This lets users more confidently deposit or borrow pausable tokens–a major improvement to the platform. In fact, many folks who would otherwise hold a pausable token might choose to hold the cToken form instead simply because it’s unpausable.
Request for Feedback
Are you for or against this idea? Are there downsides? Or any benefits not mentioned here?
Any other thoughts on what happens when a token is paused?
Anybody interested in applying for a grant and developing this with me?",21,44.2,2021-07-12
['repayBorrow with cTokens'],"I like this idea. It’s so natural that had it been included in the protocol at the start we wouldn’t give it another thought.
Back when we were discussing whether to include WBTC as an asset, there was concern about infinite minting and pausing of WBTC. I proposed a wrapped version (wWBTC) as a way to enable a supply cap (by limiting the amount of wWBTC that could be minted) and to insulate against pauses. But that added a undesired layer of complexity. I don’t think it occurred to us that cWBTC could provide the pause protection on its own.
I would extend the current proposal to also add a new liquidateBorrow() method that accepts CTokens as the repaid asset. That would allow liquidations to proceed as designed even if the repaid underlying is paused, so long as there is a liquid market for the CTokens. I expect that anything serious enough to trigger a pause would be accompanied by volatile market conditions, so it’s important that the liquidation system continues to operate in that scenario.",12,17.4,2021-07-15

I’m new here so I’m not sure where this question falls under. I refer to a proposal on compound on increasing the WBTC factor to 75% (Set WBTC Collateral Factor to 75% - #8 by jmo). I noticed that, that proposal succeeded, but some reason, the cap is 65%.
I’ve followed the discussion, and noted that Gauntlet voted against that proposal, but accidentally approved it. First, can I confirm that there is no intent of following through with that proposal and increasing the collateral factor? Second, how is the community supporting operational mistakes such as accidentally approving the vote? During the attack on Coinbase oracle/DAI, that could be argued as a mistake as well, and people lost money during that attack. I’m just wondering how binding governance proposals are.

Is there even a way to quantitatively determine the odds of this? I mean all it takes is for a couple of big whales (ie Gauntlet or Rob Leshner) to vote constructively on their agenda and it would force positions into liquidation.

Changes to support Polygon/MATIC

Done

* Most practical work of actually ge…tting the rust side of the Polygon integration is done.

Open questions

* Do we like the ""feature flag""?
* How are we going to handle in flight configuration of `matic_starport_address` and `matic_starport_parent_block`? We can't do it the same way that we do for Ethereum even if we wanted to because it would require us to change the chain spec file every time we add a new network which is not workable. *update* I put in into storage for now, I am actually quite happy with the way it came out.
* I am somewhat uncomfortable with the way `pallets/cash/src/chains.rs` and `pallets/cash/src/events.rs` due to code duplication. Maybe `chains.rs` is what we want but I feel like the compiler should be able to write that code somehow. The same thing applies to `events.rs` but to a somewhat lesser extent. I can see how it is easy to reach for macros in rust at this point but I think we should resist that urge. If we are OK with doing this set of changes every time we add a chain I guess that is alright. The real issue comes in when you want to make a change to the structure and you have to change 27 places. Thankfully, the rust compiler is your friend. I did notice at least one explicit `panic` in that file due to a mismatch in enum variant though which in my mind is throwing up your hands on static type analysis.

More work to do probably before we merge this

* Integration testing focused on regression testing?

Note: change the base branch back to develop when we are ready. This is just to …show the diff better.

This testing approach uses the same ganache instance and the same contract code but we deploy two of everything. This allows us to simulate being on a different EVM compatible blockchain. The same actors / owners are used but this should not really cause any problem.  The one open question that I have is around how we want to handle token balances. Right now, the token balance is set on both matching tokens so given this code:

```
let lock_scen_info = {
    tokens: [
        { token: 'usdc', balances: { ashley: 1000 } }
    ],
    validators: ['alice', 'bob']
};
```

The ashley address will have 1000 usdc on both chains. That is not ideal but it is now a question of how we want to paramaterize this configuration to say where the balance reside. We could do something like an optional dict with default as in what is above is valid and will default to the ethereum chain and if you want something on a different chain you have to specify the chain name as below

```
let lock_scen_info = {
    tokens: [
        { token: 'usdc', balances: { ashley: {'matic': 1000} } }
    ],
    validators: ['alice', 'bob']
};
```

I admit that this would be preferable 


```
let lock_scen_info = {
    tokens: [
        { chain: 'matic', token: 'usdc', balances: { ashley: {'matic': 1000} } }
    ],
    validators: ['alice', 'bob']
};
```

but that would somehow seem to indicate that the entire token should _only_ exist on that chain which I dont _think_ we want. Perhaps it is something like 


```
let lock_scen_info = {
    tokens: [
        { chains: ['eth','matic'], token: 'usdc', balances: { ashley: {'matic': 1000} } }
    ],
    validators: ['alice', 'bob']
};
```

still a work in progress

Polygon Starport Call Notes - Call #1 (June 1st, 2021)
Hello! Thanks everyone that participated in today’s call. I took some notes during the call. Please let me know if I misunderstood an explanation or have some info in here that is not accurate. I can make edits with corrections and clarifications. The next call will take place in 2 weeks from today, likely at a slightly earlier time. We will post future call details soon!

Wayne (Compound Labs) has made some progress on a Polygon Starport. The development process of the Starport so far has been to run 2 Ganache chains locally, one for Ethereum and one for Polygon. Also run an instance of a Gateway node locally that hooks up to those Ganache instances.
Wayne is deploying both a Polygon Starport contract and a CASH contract to the Ganache instance, and attempting to get the Lock operation to work locally.
Wayne is working on creating a test to run the operation; the test currently fails. Once this test passes, it will be the first milestone in development of the Polygon starport.
There is a forum thread to discuss the progress of the Starport
We went over introductions of everyone in the call. Included several members of Compound Labs, Polygon Team, and interested community members.
Jared (Compound Labs) took time to cover what a Starport is: Each peer chain to Gateway needs to have a Starport in order to enable collateral to be supplied to Gateway. It is required that assets be locked in the Starport of the peer chain and also an event must be emitted regarding the Lock, so that Gateway can read it, and recognize the account’s new balance. Once the collateral is Locked and the event is processed by Gateway, the user earns interest in CASH and can borrow another asset.
Gateway is the v3 of the Compound protocol. The current instance on Ethereum is v2 of the Compound protocol.
Jared asked about how block finality works on Polygon.
Jaynti (Polygon) says that it works similar to Ethereum, there is a checkpoint every 3 hours. Transactions go onto Ethereum every 3 hours and then they are considered final. Info can be read from the receipt on Ethereum at any time. A checkpoint is when all nodes on Polygon agree, then the data is verified and written to Ethereum.
Mihailo (Polygon) asked about other examples of Starports being built (EVM and non-EVM) so they can refer to those when building a Polygon Starport
Jared said that Polygon will likely be the first EVM based chain. Flow is being worked on, but it is not close to completion currently. The Polygon Starport might be the first completed besides the Ethereum Starport.
Adam (Compound Labs) Asked what code changes must be made to Gateway in order to include a new Gateway Starport.
Jared said the runtime (Gateway code) must be modified and voted in through Compound governance (soft-fork). Gateway workers need to be made to fetch the events emitted by the new peer chain. Several enums need to be made in Gateway for the new chain, and then applied through a soft-fork code upgrade. Examples of some of the enums needed on Gateway are the addresses of the Starport and CASH token on the peer chain, and also the first block in which the Starport is recognized.
Toni (Compound Labs) Asked what is a good wait time for events on Polygon? For Ethereum, 6 blocks is a good measure. What is a good amount of blocks on Polygon?
Jaynti: 128 blocks is a good measure.
Max (Compound Labs) asked do we need to wait for the checkpoint to be posted on Ethereum to be considered final?
Jaynti said yes, but this depends on how the Starport will work. Many applications are interacting with the chain directly. You can wait a certain number of blocks instead of waiting for the checkpoint. The process for re-orgs will be similar to Ethereum but we will need to do some more research on this implementation specifically before we know the answer.
Jay (community) asked: how can the community members help out? (for those that are not a part of Compound Labs or Polygon)
Jared: By reviewing the code that we publicly push to GitHub, like Wayne’s branch. This can be reviewed by the community which would be helpful.
Mihailo proposed for the group to come up with a roadmap for the project
Hamzah (Polygon) We should come up with the roadmap on the forums.
Mihailo asked: Are Gateway and Ethereum deployed to production (mainnet)?
Jared: No, we are using Ropsten testnet and we are awaiting audits. We should launch the Polygon Starport first on the Polygon testnet before a mainnet hookup.

['Compound Free Public Infrastructure by OnFinality'],"TLDR; OnFinality is the leading IaaS (infrastructure as a service) platform providing mission critical infrastructure to the Polkadot ecosystem. We are proposing to support Compound’s Gateway on our platform, allowing free community shared node API endpoints and one-click dedicated node deployments.

About OnFinality
OnFinality is a SaaS platform providing infrastructure services for the Polkadot/Substrate community. Our mission is to support all blockchain developers in the world by providing core infrastructure so they can focus on building the next dApp.
Our API Service is completely free (within usage limits) and has launched with access to Polkadot, Kusama, and other Substrate based networks. We also provide one-click deployment and centralised management of dedicated nodes across different cloud providers. We are the largest IaaS project in the Polkadot/substrate community, serving over 150 million JSON RPC requests to our public API service every day. We’re used by the top Polkadot projects to provide critical CI/CD services to help develop their test networks.

Motivation
Setting up blockchain infrastructure is difficult, time consuming, and expensive:

It requires a level of server development expertise that many do not have. A Gateway validator node for example, requires the ability to compile a Rust program to a substrate binary, knowledge of SSL certificate handling, websocket management, firewall configuration, AWS KMS management and more to setup, run, and monitor a production node.
It’s costly to run a full validator node nearly continuously (especially with Gateway’s hardware requirements), especially when your dApp’s traffic is low and inconsistent.
Running production level infrastructure is especially tricky. You need to autoscale quickly to handle bursty traffic, and you want to provide services in different regions around the world to provide low latency services - all of this is incredibly costly, but comes with significant economies of scale for a provider.
DevOps requires constant attention - time that would be better spent elsewhere building something.

As demonstrated by us in the Polkadot domain and Infura in the Ethereum domain, a shared node API service helps mitigate these barriers of entry to trying out a new protocol or network by reducing all these costs to near zero. We manage all the nodes for our users and distribute them across the world (with intelligent routing) to achieve global scalability from day 1, we monitor each node and ensure that they meet certain service levels, and we have the expertise and scale to handle production workloads and high peak traffic.
In summary, we try to reduce the pain of getting started developing on Compound’s Gateway network and minimise the costs of accessing secure nodes while traffic from your dApp is low.

Proposal

Scope
OnFinality will implement and run a network of shared Compound Gateway public nodes on our API service for your community to access for free.

This funding grant consists of three key components:

Initial one off setup costs to extend OnFinality to onboard Compound Gateway
Initial one off setup costs to deploy and enable a pool of Gateway nodes in a high performance cluster (for community API services)
Ongoing running costs of this pool of Gateway nodes


We plan to run a single cluster with a pool of 3 public Compound Gateway nodes initially.
Users of this API service receive 500,000 free requests each day
In the future, we’ll provide additional paid tiers of API Service usage above those 500,000 daily requests at different costs structures


Outcomes
There are three main outcomes we believe our service will provide the Compound Community:

Grow the Compound ecosystem by reducing the barriers to entry to access a high performance Gateway validator node
Help scale existing projects in the Compound ecosystem by providing infrastructure  services that can be depended on
Assist with the testing of the Compound Gateway protype network by providing valuable data back to the community on how validator nodes are running and scaling as the network traffic increases, and what kind of requests are commonly made


Milestones
Milestone 1: Onboard Compound Gateway to the OnFinality platform so new validator node deployments can be automated via deployments of a Docker image to Kubernetes clusters.
Milestone 2: A single cluster of publicly accessible Gateway nodes that can be accessed by the compound community users under the terms of the free service (limited SLA, and only 500,000 daily requests per user). This milestone includes estimations of the ongoing costs required to run the cluster for the remainder of this quarter (April, May, June).
It’s important to note that the ongoing running costs are a current estimate for a small cluster of nodes providing free tier access to Compound Gateway users. If the number of users taking advantage of this free tier exceeds what this cluster can provide, we may need to add additional clusters in other geographies, and will therefore revise the ongoing costs in order to continue to maintain service levels. Decisions and data around an additional cluster deployment will be shared with the community ahead of time.

Cost Breakdown
Milestone 1: Onboard Compound Gateway
Initial one-off setup costs for a developer to extend OnFinality to support Compound’s infrastructure and node deployment process:
1.5 Week (1 FTE) = $100/hr * 8 * 7.5  = USD$6,000
Milestone 2: Deploy Single Cluster
Initial costs to deploy and enable a cluster of Compound Gateway nodes on the OnFinality API Service and publish the public endpoint:
3 Days (1 FTE) = $100/hr * 8 * 3 = $2,400
The following table shows the price of a single cluster of Compound Gateway nodes (all prices are in USD). Note that we’re subsidising the data traffic costs for this cluster for the remainder of this first quarter (May and June). The ongoing costs will be resubmitted every quarter in advance and are based on the following calculations.
The total price is shown as USD $2,615.00.

['Oracle Contributor'],"After 6-months, it is great to see the protocol running on the new oracle system. A couple of total ground-up reworks, countless edits, and a lot of convincing, but I am thrilled to see it implemented. The improvement will help prevent another Dai November 2020 event and enable the protocol to list a breadth of new markets.
While the major update has been made, more work is still needed. We still need to transition the Uniswap anchor from v2 to v3, support additional markets, ongoing monitoring, and further research the system’s efficiency. The recent milestone is the beginning of a more vigilant and efficient Compound.
I am requesting a 0.000214 Contributor Comp Speed grant from the protocol. Over the last 6-months, I acted as the project manager for the oracle improvement. I researched a myriad of options, worked closely with the Chainlink team, managed community feedback and input, championed the project, and most importantly, got it through governance. The ongoing contributor grant will be for the work I have done to get the oracle improvement in place and to manage it going forward.
The contributorCompSpeed grant works similarly to the compSpeed parameter for cTokens. The speed is set to a number of COMP rewarded each block, and the grant receipt can claim it like regular COMP rewards. However, unlike a typical grant, it will be distributed over time rather than immediately, and the grant can be ended at any time by governance if the community feels I am not doing a good job maintaining and developing the oracle system.
A contributorCompSpeed of 0.000214 is ~500 COMP a year using an average block time of 13.5 seconds, and the address associated with it will be my governance address 0x9B68c14e936104e9a7a24c712BEecdc220002984/gettyhill.eth.
If this is successful, I hope this encourages other community members to apply for ongoing contributor grants.

Only concern I have is paying out 100% in COMP could cause some issues. If the price tanks, we can’t expect contributors to work for below market rates so governance could be forced to increase the award. On the other hand if the price of COMP increased, we wouldn’t want to reduce an existing payment stream as this will make contributors less willing to work with Compound in the future and reduce trust in Compound governance overall.
I think an ideal solution would be to pay out 60-80% in stablecoins (could be taken from DAI/USDC/USDT/TUSD reserves at governance discretion), with the remainder in COMP. This ensures that contributors will earn at least an acceptable rate of pay in a stable asset, while preserving the incentive benefits and upside participation of COMP payments.",51,75.2,2021-06-28

Good question. The goal of the grant is to reward 6-months of work already done and future work. I think it should run for at least 6 months. That being said, I’m not going anywhere. This is just the beginning; the current solution is far from ideal (best available solution), and I don’t think we’ll ever reach a perfect solution but I want to strive to have the safest and most robust oracle system.

['Adjusting COMP distribution model'],"I’m concerned that the current COMP distribution model is not performing as well as it could. A couple issues:

Distributing COMP to borrowers increases wash borrowing activity (where users borrow and then re-deposit an asset to farm COMP) which brings little value to the protocol
Letting users sell accumulated COMP immediately means that farmers have no stake in the long term success of the protocol

I’m not sure about the technical feasibility of making adjustments, but I think that weighting COMP rewards towards suppliers would lead to a larger overall pool of locked assets, which in turn would naturally incentivize borrowers through deep liquidity and consistently low interest rates. Additionally, creating some sort of vesting period for COMP farmers where they can only vote with their stake but can’t transfer or sell might help better align incentives.
Just for kicks, I’ll throw up a couple polls to gauge community sentiment (irrespective of the technical feasibility of making these changes). Polls are both multiple choice, and voters are encouraged to vote for all options that they would support.
What portion of COMP rewards should be allocated to asset suppliers vs borrowers:




less than 50% suppliers / more than 50% borrowers

70% suppliers / 30% borrowers
80% suppliers / 20% borrowers
90% suppliers / 10% borrowers
100% suppliers / 0% borrowers

['Adjusting COMP distribution model'],"I voted for status quo, but if you wanted to change the distribution between suppliers/borrowers , technically there are a few ways to do it via the standard Comptroller upgrade process.
Probably the least invasive change is to add a multiplier (0 <= compSpeedSuppliers <= 1) that can be set via governance and use compSpeed * compSpeedSuppliers during updateCompSupplyIndex and compSpeed * (1 - compSpeedSuppliers) during updateCompBorrowIndex.
A slightly more (read) efficient way to do it is to store separate compSpeedsSuppliers and compSpeedsBorrowers, however you would likely want to deprecate the current compSpeeds slot in that case.
To add a vesting period, you could modify the transferComp function to only transfer if the account is ‘vested’ enough. This would probably be too gassy though, since you would probably need to add some SSTOREs.
Instead you could disable the semi-automatic transfer, and modify claimComp to perform the checks for ‘vested’.",69,68.8,2020-07-31
['Adjusting COMP distribution model'],"I really like the idea for the COMP rewards lockup, but I don’t believe the proposal to shift the 50/50 split of rewards between supply and borrowing will have the effect you want. It’s my understanding there are two pieces of the COMP rewards formula:

Per-collateral split. This looks at the relative borrow size between the collateral types and distributes the COMP rewards to that collateral pro-rata.
Supply / Borrow split inside the collateral. This is the number you are proposing to adjust if I am understanding you correctly.

I’m not convinced that adjusting the numbers for (2) will have a large effect on the current behaviours. It’s my guess that the recycling borrow / supply is being driven largely by (1) to get the most rewards going to your collateral type. Once you have most of the rewards going to your collateral type it’s not so important if you are getting those rewards via the supply or the borrow. You will naturally want to recycle your collateral regardless to keep (1) high. I may be wrong on this as the dynamics are a little complex, but this is my intuition.
I think no matter what you do these rewards are going to gamed in a way that is not really helpful to the protocol. Speaking as an MKR holder, I would like to move the rewards around such that not all the pressure is on Dai. I believe this could be achieved by moving some of the inter-collateral rewards (1) to be given out via Supply and not all based on Borrow. Something like a 50/50 Supply/Borrow split on the rewards going to collaterals instead of it being entirely determined by the Borrow which heavily favours the Dai interest rate curve.",62,72.4,2020-08-01
['Adjusting COMP distribution model'],"Good point, @hexonaut. While we’re on the topic, @rleshner – what’s the rationale for allocating COMP rewards based on the relative notional borrow size of markets? My guess is that users are predominantly drawn to Compound b/c of high yields. Incentivizing borrowers to participate through COMP rewards formula (1) increases supply rates (as a byproduct of increased borrow demand). Thus, high yields are achieved and Compound continues building its user base.",57,31.4,2020-08-02
['Adjusting COMP distribution model'],"A more simple approach would do the same. Keeping COMP speed where they stand with each asset.
Changing the 50/50 supply/borrow distribution of COMP rewards to give more to borrowers would help Compound capture more borrowers. Even just a small change like 40% to suppliers and 60% to borrowers could be enough to entice people who are on the fence about borrowing.
The greater the percentage of each asset that is borrowed means the higher the yield is for suppliers. Every user of Compound is a supplier, which means everyone earns a higher yield.
This could increase the COMP rewards that are traded, because borrowers will also have a higher interest rate. The increased trading of rewards would make it more accessible to obtain COMP for those wanting to participate in voting/governance of the protocol.",25,35.0,2021-07-03

Tyler Ether - Isolated Markets (starts at 1:08)

Tyler shared an idea that would allow the protocol to support supplying and borrowing for any type of asset, without spreading risk to other markets. This would be achieved by creating isolated market pairs, where users can only supply and borrow the specified assets in the pair. Tyler plans to spec out the architecture over the coming weeks, and will share more information on the exisiting forum thread.

0xLeo - cToken Futures Market (starts at 7:56)

Leo shared an overview of his grants project to develop cToken Futures Markets. The proposed cToken futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a cToken at a fixed price at a future date, similar to an FX forward. This would allow for fixed-rate deposits and stable-rate borrowing, and can serve as a hedge instrument for traders. Leo is currently working on the project as a part of the HackMoney hackathon, and plans to build a proof of concept over the next 3 weeks. You can read more about this project on the forum post.

Paperclip Labs - Historical APY Dashboard (starts at 22:38)

Pluto and Cyber presented their grants project to create a dashboard for historical interest rate data. They explained that after collecting community feedback, a major area of importance was to clearly explain concepts like reserves, COMP distribution, and utilization to a non-technical audience. The dashboard allows users to see all past data on historical interest rates (including the net rate from the COMP distribution), and compare different assets on the same chart. Check out the Dashboard for yourself and provide feedback on this form.

Background
Governor Bravo introduced many new ways for the compound community to modify the governance process. One of these new features is the ability to change the proposal threshold, which is currently set to 100k COMP. An address needs to have the proposal threshold delegated to their account to create a proposal.

Idea
I believe the community should consider changing the proposal threshold to about ~65k COMP. The 100k proposal threshold acts as a way to ensure that only the highest quality and vetted proposals make it to the actual governance process, but it may make it too hard. Many CAPs (Compound Autonomous Proposals) struggle to make it to the 100k threshold even when there is clear communal support.
I believe that a threshold of 65k COMP will be enough to ensure quality, but make it easier for future ideas supported by the community to make it through the governance process.",63,1007.6,2021-05-02

['Lower Proposal Threshold'],"The proposal threshold is a tool to set the “speed” of governance, and prevent toxic proposals (whether deliberately malicious, or too hasty). The 2-day review period created in Proposal 43 should further reduce the risk of a toxic proposal.
Lowering the threshold will generally increase the quantity of proposals (easier for CAPs to become live proposals, and more stakeholders who can directly create proposals).
This isn’t a parameter that should change often (governance should be as predictable as possible), but it seems that the timing is right following the launch of Governor Bravo. I support either @arr00’s suggestion of 65k, or @blck’s suggestion of 50k; whichever number we choose should have a bit of science behind it ",53,170.6,2021-05-02

 rleshner:

whichever number we choose should have a bit of science behind it


Instead of hard-coding a set number, Compound could calculate this number by using 2 variables:

Total COMP in circulation
Number of COMP holders

This could bring some science into the threshold. Because at 100k COMP, looks like only 10 addresses can propose on what could potentially affect 158,000 holders.
I would imagine a ‘decentralized’ finance project would have less decentralization at the beginning, but we are far from the beginning with Compound holding over $16B worth of supplied assets and with over $7B worth of borrowed assets.
Using the 2 variables above Compound could make the minimum amount auto adjust to allow more decentralization with time. Maybe a snapshot of the variables every 6 months or so. To start it off, 20k COMP would be fair in my opinion when looking where Compound is today. This would include less than 70 addresses, and not all 70 are probably going to want to rush to make proposals. Even if they do, the not-so-good proposals would be voted out.
To prevent accounts from spamming proposals, set a time limit/voting decay for accounts which created a proposal. If their proposal gets vetoed, then using a method like ‘slashing’ could be implemented. Where the user’s voting privilege is slowly restored. This should further push proposers to create rock-solid proposals that will launch Compound to the Moon!",44,28.8,2021-05-04
['Lower Proposal Threshold'],"@CryptoCraig thanks for weighing in; an important counterpoint is that the proposal threshold doesn’t determine how many addresses can propose changes; it determines the quantity of votes necessary for a proposal to enter the voting process.
Addresses with 100,000  delegated to them can directly create live proposals.
Any address with 100  can create an autonomous proposal; currently 476 addresses can create proposals, and the proposal threshold itself won’t change this.",43,43.6,2021-05-04
['Lower Proposal Threshold'],"I understand now. So, a user would just need to have 100 COMP (either owned or delegated to them?) to create an autonomous proposal (CAP).
Then, how does the community know to vote on the proposal at that point, with it still needing 100k votes? Sorry if this is answered somewhere, I am just very interested in Compound as this is where I’ve decided to park a good portion of my digital assets.
Proposal submissions and voting should happen on specific days, like when movies debut. This would allow voters the time needed to review a proposal and a day that they would need to come to the polls. This would also assist a CAP to reach the threshold of votes.
I still think that more COMP holders should require less votes. At 188k holders, Compound will probably have a large percentage of votes coming from the largest holders. However, in 20 years, if Compound were to accumulate 4 million holders, then COMP balances will be more distributed resulting in a greater percentage of holders needed for proposals to get to the current threshold. You said it yourself, @rleshner , there needs to be some kind of science to it, which is exactly what I think.
If just picking a number is what Compound needs right now, I say do it. But, a simple formula should be able to handle this in the future.",40,53.0,2021-05-04
['Lower Proposal Threshold'],"Feel free to stop by Discord to chat & ask questions & learn!
A user needs to own 100  to create an autonomous proposal. These proposals are typically advertised on this forum, Discord, and Twitter to gather support. Sometimes this process takes hours, sometimes days, sometimes they never gather the requisite support needed.
There is a two-day review period before voting begins on a proposal (this is a recent upgrade).",38,17.6,2021-05-04
['Lower Proposal Threshold'],"I think lowering the proposal threshold to 50k is a great idea. I have been meaning to make this post, so I am thrilled someone else has. By lowering it to 50k, we’ll be roughly doubling the number of users that can create proposals, and I think those are good users to have involved.
Having passed two CAPs, I found it too challenging to get the 100k votes required when I knew the proposal would pass. Generally, getting 100k votes delegated to a user is quite challenging, and while 50k is still a lot, I think it is the next logical step.
I think adjusting it to 65k would have a limited effect since only two users have those amounts.",39,67.8,2021-05-04
['Lower Proposal Threshold'],"I think there are two approaches to take here, the more conservative, and more ambitious.


Conservative - Decrease proposal threshold to 65k which will immediately allow 1 more EOA to propose and make the CAP process considerably easier

Ambitious - Decrease proposal threshold to 50k which will immediately allow 11 more EOAs to propose and make the CAP process considerably easier.

I would argue that the change in the ease of getting CAPs through is relatively small between 50k and 65k from empirical evidence. If I recall correctly, most CAPs that were successful got to 65k quite quickly while getting from ~65k to 100k was the harder part.
So what it really comes down to is how ambitious we want to be right now. Do we want to immediately add allow another 11 EOAs with varying levels of engagement in the community to propose, or do we want to be conservative and just make the CAP process much simpler?
Personally, I believe that due to the newly added 2 day delay, we can’t go wrong; however, I prefer to err on the side of caution and initially set the proposal threshold to 65k.",39,92.8,2021-05-05
['Lower Proposal Threshold'],"I think another viewpoint would be interesting to think of here, is the current limit PREVENTING good ideas from coming forward and being passed? Compound is by far the most active and productive governance out there, do folks feel like there are proposals that aren’t making it because of the limit?
Also, if there were to be more proposals making it to the floor, what sort of proposals do we think these would be? Requests for funds? Changes to the protocol? I think the difference is that changing the protocol is inherently risky to the entire project, while giving out money is fairly low risk (you can lose funds but the protocol is not in danger). I think considering what type of proposal we are more likely to incentivize is worthwhile considering as well as there might be another way to accommodate those proposals without changing the threshold.",31,86.2,2021-05-05
['Lower Proposal Threshold'],"I would love to propose several basic proposals and that I am sure would pass but trying to get 100k votes on a CAP is a real pain. Unless the CAP will make a big change, it is hard to get voters to delegate. In an ideal world, the CAP proposal threshold would be lower than the single user threshold, but that isn’t how the system works, and it would require a good amount of work to change it.
I can’t be the only one who has a list of low-hanging uncontentious changes that should be made and struggle with the high threshold.",33,16.6,2021-05-06
['Lower Proposal Threshold'],"@getty would it be crazy to suggest that maybe for these kinds of proposals we did something like:


If the proposal is inherently good and benefits the protocol, then we can assume we want the proposal to pass. The problem, perhaps the social capital required to wrangle the votes is expensive.


What if we compensate the folks with small amounts of COMP who delegate votes to a CAP that successfully passes a subsequent vote?


In this way, if the idea is strong, and folks likely think it will pass, they will likely support the CAP to pass the threshold, knowing that if the vote passes they will receive some small reward for doing the work of identifying a valuable proposal in advance?
It seems like folks wouldn’t really work to game this (although it’s crypto, so who knows) because the payout only happens if the vote passes. Most folks who would work to game such a vote don’t have significant COMP to make a difference at either threshold.
(another edit)
I don’t think we even need to make any protocol changes to make this work. We simply make the last instruction in the proposal a “compensate the CAP delegators with 1 comp split proportionally”",32,51.4,2021-05-06
['Lower Proposal Threshold'],"Making the proposal threshold for CAPs lower than the normal proposal threshold would be a trivial task—however, it would doesn’t make much sense to me as users could just spin up CAPs and delegate to them instead of delegating to EOAs.",30,41.0,2021-05-06
['Lower Proposal Threshold'],"That might be a neat idea but I think an incentive won’t move the needle for those holders. If you are someone with +10k comp getting a few COMP incentives doesn’t make much sense. In my mind, they are already invested and highly incentivized to support the proposal. The bigger problem in my mind is the high proposal threshold and the lack of voters set up to delegate.



 arr00:

Making the proposal threshold for CAPs lower than the normal proposal threshold would be a trivial task—however, it would doesn’t make much sense to me as users could just spin up CAPs and delegate to them instead of delegating to EOAs.


True, I didn’t think it all the way through.
The biggest things I think the protocol could do to improve governance is lower the proposal threshold to 50k, move COMP rewards from the COMP borrow lend market to voters, and set up a system where users can use COMP as collateral and vote.",32,16.4,2021-05-06
['Lower Proposal Threshold'],"Agreed with both of your points here (lowering the threshold and allowing voting with COMP collateral).
FWIW I noticed the recent CAP to add a LINK market is sitting right at the 65k COMP mark, and it seemed to have widespread support.",32,26.4,2021-05-06
['Lower Proposal Threshold'],That 65k voter (0x0d8846e5d4af5dd24be37f460c07046fd80d96a3) has done an awesome job supporting CAPs. Without them it would be much much harder to get a CAP to a full proposal. We need more voters like them.,32,6.4,2021-05-06
['Lower Proposal Threshold'],Getting delegation of voters is a problem we see elsewhere in other governances. It might be worthwhile running a program (maybe with yours truly Tally) to help get folks to delegate their vote to active participants.

['TrueUSD proposal update proposal'],"Hello, Compound community，
Thank you! With the support of the community, TrueUSD has been added as a new market in Compound after gaining 100% support in the recent vote.
It has been a while since TUSD was added to Compound Finance and performed well as a new market. The circulation and active address number have increased dramatically in the last two months with billions of dollars in monthly transaction volume. Recently, we integrated Signet by Signature Bank as a new banking partner, providing additional real-time settlement options for TUSD users and holders.
Now is an excellent time to update TUSD market parameters and make TUSD a more desirable vehicle for financial opportunity on Compound which also makes Compound an attractive Defi option for the growing TUSD community. Diversifying the portfolios and market shares of stable coins on Compound will provide the Compound community more options to park and secure their assets. As the first independently verified and live attested digital asset redeemable 1-for-1 for US Dollars, TUSD represents the best fit candidate for a diversified stable coin portfolio.
TrueUSD would like to propose the following update:
1） Improve the TUSD collateral rate to 75%
2） Distribute COMP rewards to TUSD market participants.
We are planning the following parameters. Please make a comment and share your opinion with us.
Update COMP speed for TUSD, USDC, USDT, DAI markets
From
Comptroller._setCompSpeed(“cUSDC”, 67000000000000000)
Comptroller._setCompSpeed(“cUSDT”, 9650000000000000)
Comptroller._setCompSpeed(“cDAI”, 67000000000000000)
To
Comptroller._setCompSpeed(“cUSDC”, 63000000000000000)
Comptroller._setCompSpeed(“cUSDT”, 8825000000000000)
Comptroller._setCompSpeed(“cDAI”, 63000000000000000)
Comptroller._setCompSpeed(“cTUSD”, 8825000000000000)
Calculated by the COMP distributed per day, it is 115 for TUSD, USDT market and 827 for USDC, DAI market.
We hope to hear from you and would love to provide any additional support or resource that could facilitate the execution of the proposal.

Agree 100% we need to distribute COMP reward to TUSD just like every other token in compound. Frankly i am not clear why it wasn’t included in the initial proposal for golive.


For Joyce/TUSD, you guys need to make the token much more accessible, liquid and convertible from popular wallets like coinbase.  As it stands the spread to convert to/from TUSD is insane for any volume, i can only swap batches of $25k ether per trade and even then, still losing thousands $ in slippage.  (I used binance’s wallet ).


It involves:  converting my tokens (ie usdc) to ether first (because there is only ether/tusd market that’s anywhere close to being liquid) → sending ether to binance wallet / swap (because most wallet include coinbase do not support TUSD swap) → convert from ether to TUSD in $25k chunks in multiple transactions while losing crap load $ in spread/slippage + fees →  send TUSD back to my original wallet…to be able to finally use it in compound
vs something like USDC, which i can convert most tokens to/from USDC directly in my primary wallet and done in 1 step with very little slippage.

Does anyone know what happened to TUSD in the last few days, looks like the market liquidity went nuts resulting in the borrow api shooting up from <1% to 4%

They have also borrowed over 30k COMP in order to farm COMP rewards, with the COMP tokens held in the wallet and used to vote for the TUSD addition proposal.
The rest of the wallet’s behavior is consistent with farm and dump defi participation (Circular supply/borrow of the same assets on Aave, etc).
In light of these facts, I have a few questions:

Please confirm the owner of the above mentioned wallet. Is it Justin Sun or a related entity?
Does the wallet owner have any financial ties with TrustToken? Are they a beneficial owner of or under common control with TrustToken?

In the current state, I don’t see how offering COMP rewards for TUSD would be beneficial for Compound. It seems likely to increase rather than reduce ownership concentration in the protocol. And the behavior of the TrustToken side has been completely lacking in transparency.",42,1528.4,2021-06-28

['TrueUSD proposal update proposal'],"Thanks for your due diligence. As for your questions:

Who the wallet you speak of belongs to, we do not know. There is also no way for us to find out, as wallet owners are anonymous which honors the value of blockchain technology. How wallet owners wish to use their assets is also entirely up to them and to their own discretion.
If you mean to ask whether the funds in this wallet are TrustToken or TrueUSD’s, we can confirm NO. All TUSD are held in escrow accounts with 24/7 live on-chain attestations by Armanino, which you can see here: TrustExplorer - real-time audit. TUSD holders mint and redempt their TUSD directly with our financial institution partners, such as Silvergate, PrimeTrust, Signet, etc. TrueUSD or TrustToken have no access to their funds.
About this address, thanks for sharing. We looked into more details, there are 37K COMP, 16512 AAVE and 11K WBTC and more. More importantly, he/she holds COMP rewards. We don’t see the farm and dump you mentioned. From what we do see, the wallet owner has borrowed about $1 billion and supplied $1.5 billion on AAVE, and surely Compound would like to see the same support for COMP.
We don’t want to pick sides and would want everyone to enjoy the self governing community Compound founders created. However I’m very curious, as a diehard Compound supporter yourself who is very active on the forum and cares about the health of the entire ecosystem, how much COMP have you held since COMP launched? and how much money you put into Compound? Let’s build the community together and welcome more whales and holders of any size.

In light of your concerns regarding a wallet address, yes, we can all see this wallet belongs to a whale on Compound, AAVE, and other defi platforms. Whales in any ecosystem expands the platform’s strength and growth, so we are happy to see a whale using COMP to obtain TUSD, USDC, DAI or any form of stablecoin he/she would like. A higher utilization rate will incentivize more assets to join Compound. Isn’t this what we all want to see?",29,20.8,2021-06-29
['TrueUSD proposal update proposal'],"From a risk management point of view, having a diverse stablecoin options is beneficial for funds safety on a decentralized lending platform.Relying on USDC as the only regulated stable coin backed by the US dollar on the platform is not sustainable. It’s reasonable to support TUSD, a well-performing asset market, considering its total supply and total borrow rates.
From the Compound growth point of view, the current TVL on Compound is lower than AAVE. Our collective goal is to boost the TVL and make COMP holders proud.
This is also why diversification of multiple stablecoins and additional rewards activities on Compound should be encouraged to attract more users to participate on Compound. If you are a Compound lover, and wish to see the community flourish, you want to see holders of any size find their spot in Compound. The amazing thing about Defi is that it is built on liquidity and cash flow, funds moving around means the platform is active and energetic.
From TUSD point of view, we would like to see more whales come over to where TUSD is integrated, as we want to see our partners flourish as well.
Moreover, TUSD strives to expand into more quality platforms and applications. TUSD market cap and holders have seen rapid growth in the past quarter, and the momentum is expected to be maintained if not expedited. To name a few, other than the Compound market, TUSD has opened a metapool on Curve.fi with over 4M in votes from veCRV holders. TUSD is also exploring partnerships with various projects on BSC, including listing on Ellipsis and adding TUSD in the Syrup pool on PancakeSwap. TUSD also launched on TRON and joined SUN.io and the JUST DeFi ecosystem. To facilitate the use of TUSD and make TUSD more accessible for users, TUSD works with leading mainstream exchanges with trading pairs and rewarding activities.

Under Techteryx ownership led by Ms Jennifer Jiang, a business executive with extensive experience in traditional finance, currently worth over US$3.0 billion and is deeply connected with traditional industries.
TrueUSD still prioritizes trust and transparency with four key points:

The same TrustToken team will continue to be deeply involved in running TUSD and for compliance and underlying reserve management.
The underlying reserves will continue to be audited and attested to on a live basis by Armanino LLP, a top 25 accounting and audit firm based in the US (https://www.armaninollp.com/) who, in addition to live attestations, also provide “proof of reserves” audits for exchanges (Proof of Reserves | Armanino).
All TUSD funds are held at fully licensed and regulated banks and trust companies in the United States and Hong Kong, including PrimeTrust (https://www.primetrust.com/ ), Silvergate Bank (https://www.silvergatebank.com/), First Digital (https://1stdigital.com/ ), and Signature Bank (www.signatureny.com). All funds are held in FBO accounts for the benefit of TUSD token holders and cannot, under any circumstances, be withdrawn by its owners for any proprietary use. All minting and redemptions of TUSD will continue to be verified by these custodians and banks regulated by U.S. and Hong Kong regulators before any TUSD can be created or burnt.
TrueUSD private keys are managed in the same way as before, by the new TUSD management team with multisignature, a Gnosis SAFE (gnosis-safe.io ) solution.

Lido staking went live on December 18th after the withdrawal key ceremony ended. Chorus One, Staking Facilities, Certus One, Argent, Banteg (yearn.finance), Alex Svanevik (Nansen), Anton Bukov (1inch), Michael Egorov (Curve/Nucypher), Rune Christensen (MakerDAO), Will Harborne (DeversiFi) and Mustafa Al-Bassam (LazyLedger) came together over a four-day event to generate threshold signatures for Lido’s withdrawal keys in a secure environment on air-gapped machines. Lido will move over to a fully non-custodial solution in the near future.
The Lido DAO manages the liquid staking protocol by deciding on key parameters (e.g. setting fees, assigning node operators and oracles).
Overview:
The Lido Protocol, built on Ethereum 2.0’s beacon chain, allows users to earn staking rewards on the beacon chain without locking Ether or maintaining staking infrastructure.
Lido allows users to deposit ETH and receive stETH. The deposited ETH is then pooled and staked with node operators selected by the Lido DAO. stETH represents the user’s staked ETH balance of the beacon chain along with staking rewards accrued or penalties inflicted on validators in the beacon chain. When transactions are enabled on the beacon chain, stETH can be redeemed for unstaked ETH and accumulated rewards.
Unlike beacon chain ETH, stETH can be freely transferred and traded.

stETH Liquidity and Volumes:

stETH’s fully diluted marketcap stands at $267MM
stETH primarily trades on Curve Finance with the stETH/ETH pool holding $339MM of liquidity currently. Utilization remains low at 0.21% with $750k in 24 hour volume
70.5% of stETH is held in the Curve stETH/ETH pool


1456×946 54.5 KB

Considerations:

stETH has become one of the largest and most liquid ETH 2.0 staking platforms. Adding stETH to Compound would enable ETH 2.0 stakers to borrow against their stake. With the growth of ETH 2.0 staking, stETH can drive new borrow volume to Compound. On the lending side, stETH holders can earn a yield on their idle deposits
Lido has been live for more than 2.5 months with no major bugs or slashing events
stETH is not traded on any major centralized exchanges. The oracle would likely need to reference Curve, given the platform is the primary venue for stETH price discovery
Compared to ETH, stETH carries additional risk including Lido smart contract risk, liquidity considerations, and ETH 2.0 slashing risks
Lido has partnered with Unslashed to offer slashing cover

A quote from a Coindesk article today… “* A rogue developer withdrew $500K worth of governance token SGT from decentralized Eth 2.0 staking service SharedStake. TAKEAWAY: A vulnerability in the timelock code that was meant to release SGT tokens gradually over time was exploited by one of the developers of SharedStake. The SGT tokens were subsequently dumped on the market, and the price of the tokens fell 96% from $1.60 to under $0.03. Furthermore, users have been advised to stop using and to exit the platform’s staking services because it remains unclear if the withdrawal keys for some 16,000 ETH, worth roughly $32 million, have also been compromised in the process.

We can liquidate a user by paying off the borrowing amount of another cToken’s underlying asset and receiving some percentage of another cToken’s collateral. For example if a user borrowed 100 DAI for 10 cETH and is in the red, a liquidator can pay some DAI and receive some discounted value of their cETH.

However I noticed some users borrow the same underlying token that they used as collateral. For example, borrowing ETH and using their cETH as collateral.
When I try to liquidate those users (example from the screenshot) by using cETH.liquidateBorrow and sending ETH I get the nonReentrant “re-entered” error. This is because the cETH contract needs to call itself and throws an error.
so my question is this, is it not possible to liquidate users that are borrowing from the same cToken they use as collateral? If it not possible, then how does the cToken get the collateral back?

This is in-progress work, but I wanted to share the changes publicly as soon as possible so that the community may audit them and leave feedback while in active development and testing.
Given the limited scope of the changes, we recommend a community bug bounty and peer review in place of a formal audit.
The changes are as follows:
Comptroller Implementation
#123: Markets with a collateral factor of 0% and borrowing paused would be considered deprecated by the Comptroller, and allowed to be completely liquidated. This allows the closure of all outstanding borrows and the removal of reserves in deprecated markets including SAI, REP, and future migrations.
#125: A gas optimization for the claimComp function, significantly improving the gas cost of claiming COMP across multiple markets at once.
cToken Implementation
#124: Modifies the seize function to transfer 2.8% of a liquidation to cToken reserves, reducing the risk of cascading liquidations that could render the protocol insolvent. With each liquidation, the protocol’s ability to recover (or utilize reserves) increases. Note: this reduces the effective liquidator incentive to ~5%, the historical baseline.

With each liquidation, the protocol’s ability to recover (or utilize reserves) increases. Note: this reduces the effective liquidator incentive to ~5%, the historical baseline.


I think this is probably a good idea. But it may be worth reviewing this from a market risk perspective. When the liquidator incentive was last at 5%, total borrowing on Compound (and in defi in general) was much lower, and gas costs have also increased substantially. Maker’s new liquidation system also clears debt much more quickly than the previous system (target of 1-2 hours vs 6 hours for old system).
All of this together increases the risk that liquidation will not be profitable with only 5% incentive, potentially allowing prices to fall further and push the market into insolvency. My inclination would be to increase the total liquidation penalty so that the liquidator incentive remains 8%, and the protocol liquidation fee is charged on top of that.
That being said, I think this change will be a net positive for Compound. More protocol revenue from riskier users (as identified by their position being liquidated) allows for charging less from safer users.",37,142.4,2021-06-08

Some empirical data suggest that the difference between 5% and 8%, currently goes to MEV anw.

Instead of

"['Temperature Check on Proposals for the Addition of YFI, SUSHI, MKR, SNX, and CRV']","Summary
Compound’s list of supported assets has not seen a material shift since the launch of on-chain governance in 2020, aside from the inclusion of Uniswap’s native token UNI and USDT. Growth in the DeFi space has led to demand for the collateralization of ecosystem assets currently not enabled on Compound. ParaFi Capital wishes to propose the addition of such DeFi coins to Compound’s money market, though is seeking insight as to which asset should be targeted for addition first.
Motivation
Aside from UNI, whose addition to the protocol took place at the start of October, Compound does not support DeFi-native assets. This comes in spite of the fact that there is a demand to collateralize these assets, as indicated by the $368 million worth of UNI supplied on Compound and the deposits of coins such as MKR and xSUSHI in other money market protocols.
Many members within the communities of DeFi protocols have discussed their desire to make their holdings productive in private and public channels. The assets that are often top of mind for these communities are YFI, SUSHI, MKR, SNX, and CRV. These coins are actively traded on Coinbase Pro and have deep liquidity across the decentralized exchange ecosystem.
By adding one or all of these DeFi coins, Compound will likely see increased TVL growth and growth in demand to borrow existing assets supported by the protocol.
Action Item
While Compound would likely benefit from the addition of a number of DeFi assets, to minimize stress on governance, we propose starting with one. To gauge the asset the Compound community wants to be prioritized, there is a poll attached to this post with the options outlined earlier in this post.
After the poll is closed in one week (May 20th), ParaFi will seek to move forward with formalized proposals exploring the addition of the three assets in order of the number of votes they receive.

['Grant to create a Compound quest on RabbitHole'],"Hey everyone! My name is Ben and I am the Operations Lead at RabbitHole, a platform where users can earn crypto by using new crypto applications. For projects like Compound, we provide the best tool to find new users and contributors and to incentivize them to act in valuable ways to the network.
We are applying for a $50k Compound grant to create a quest on RabbitHole that drives our users to provide liquidity on Compound. RabbitHole is the home for thousands of crypto-enthusiasts who are looking to learn how to use new protocols, so we view this as a great opportunity for Compound to acquire users who are genuinely interested in learning about, using, and hopefully even contributing to Compound.
The grant money will be used to reward the users that complete this quest, serving as direct user acquisition for Compound. We use TheGraph to verify the new users complete the quest and BrightID for built-in Sybil resistance.
We see this first quest as the starting point for a long-term relationship with Compound. RabbitHole is looking to become the place where DAOs find the people they need, whether it is users, token holders, or contributors. As our product evolves and Compound’s needs evolve, we can collaborate on further quests that incentivize any on-chain action. For example, RabbitHole can find protocol politicians and reward them by creating a proposal on Compound and having it passed.
Our team has already successfully done quests with the teams from ENS, OpenSea, PoolTogether, Gnosis, Uniswap and more, which have been completed by over 10,000 unique addresses.
We applied for a grant through CGP, but we want to collaborate with the Compound community as we think about what our partnership could look like if we are accepted. We would love to hear thoughts on the overall proposal, any particular Compound markets that might be worth incentivizing users to provide liquidity to, and ideas for quests that would be valuable to explore in the future.

I think running “growth” experiments is very much in the interest of Compound and its community. Some questions:

How should we think about what “success” looks like? Traditional companies compare the customer acquisition cost to the customer lifetime value to gauge whether a growth initiative was successful. Is that how we should think about Rabbithole quests as well?
How will the $50k be spent? How long will it last?
Will Rabbithole share quest data with our community?

['Grant to create a Compound quest on RabbitHole'],"Thanks for the questions @sukernik! Answers to each of the bullet points below:

Generally, comparing customer acquisition cost and customer lifetime value is a fair way of thinking about these types of campaigns, but we (RabbitHole and the broader community) will have to reimagine what the actual metrics are in web3. The line between users, owners, and contributors are increasingly blended so the results of a campaign like this can no longer be distilled down into a single metric that tracks the amount of revenue driven. RabbitHole prides itself on providing users that actually want to contribute, use, and be part of communities, a lot of which is difficult to measure in the short-term. However, we view this as a worthwhile experiment in understanding how we can drive the right type of people to Compound’s community.
The $50k would be split: $40k to reward RabbitHole users for depositing on Compound and $10k to cover RabbitHole’s fee. We would abide by a one-year lockup on our $10k fee, and would use our tokens to be an active voice in governance with a bias towards advocating for user participation over short term price maximization. The grant would cover one quest, which typically lasts between 1-2 weeks, though we are open to community suggestions on the duration one way or another.
Yes! We will share statistics and metrics about the number and types of users that the quest drove. We are working on more longitudinal data as well, so we could help answer, for instance, what was the “year-long value” of a customer that was driven to the platform through a quest.

['Oracle Infrastructure: Chainlink Proposal'],"In addition to the medianizer, I have another proposal for the community to consider for improving the oracle infrastructure. While researching various solutions, I talked with Johann at Chainlink to learn more about their system because Aave and other notable protocols utilize them. I thought it would be prudent to get their opinion as well.
The Chainlink team has a proposal for the community to consider. As many of you may know, Chainlink has an existing oracle system that anyone can use. While Chainlink has been considered in the past, I mostly dismissed it because their existing system contains an admin key (multisig), and I did not think it would pass a vote. However, their team is willing to launch oracle contracts, similar to this CRV/ETH oracle, without an admin key or with an admin key that the Compound community controls. As well, their team is willing to launch any oracle the protocol would like and built to the parameters we want as a community.
This was a game-changer to me, so after the call, I started doing due diligence. Here is a quick summary I have gathered from speaking with the Chainlink team on why the community should consider using the Chainlink solution.


They are the most experienced team in the space with building secure oracle solutions. They have a 100+ person team, with engineers, researchers, and DevOps solely focused on oracles full time.


Their systems have been online for years and are securing significant amounts of onchain value. Aave, Synthetix, dYdX, and a bunch of other DeFi dApps use them.


They already have a proven system of reporters, posters, and aggregators in place.


Will require minimal technical effort for us to switch over and launch new oracles in the future.


They have high standards for data quality. Each oracle node takes a median from multiple data aggregators, and numerous oracle responses are further aggregated. This will give us strong market coverage and redundancy.


Their systems are reliable and consistently post price updates during extreme network congestion, such as the recent gas price spike of over 1,400 Gwei, and provide extensive real-time monitoring of all networks.


They have built a node network with reputation systems and visualization tools for the community to monitor their onchain performance. We can even select which nodes we want.


Shared costs for oracle networks with other ecosystem projects, meaning it’s cheaper than publishing the data ourselves.


After thinking on these points and how they compare to a community built medianizer, I do have some concerns about the medianizer that I would like to share:


Using centralized exchange APIs only provides raw, unrefined data. That leaves us vulnerable to price wicks, exchange downtime, AWS/Cloudflare concerns, etc.


Using DEX data as a primary source is unideal due to the rapidly changing liquidity landscape.


Getting exchanges to join the Open Oracle seems to be harder than anticipated. All exchanges are currently low on resources due to trading volume and general usage being at an all-time high.


The economics of posters are incomplete and unrefined.


After weighing the options, I feel Chainlink is worth considering. However, before I and the Chainlink team explore their approach any further, I want to get a temperature check from the community.
If the community is interested in exploring this, here are the rough steps we would take:


Once enough interest is expressed, Chainlink would launch the 10 oracles Compound requires.


Setup a new oracle contract for the comptroller to point to.


Launch everything on a testnet and have the contracts audited.


Costs: Chainlink would like Compound to pay $150 per oracle per month. With 10 markets (pegging USDC to 1), that would be $1500 a month to stream to Chainlink via the set _setContributorCompSpeed.

Hey, I’m just chimming in to say something. While data.chain.link is -indeed- a tool created and updated by ChainlinkLabs, resources like reputation.link and market.link are the initiative of third parties. Personally I think this brings some added value and enrichment in terms of decentralization, which is also extremely positive.



 Manta_Ray:

Is it possible to choose which nodes are added to these price feeds? As in, can we choose based on what the reputation.link website says are the best nodes?


Both the Reputation site and the Marketplace serve as a Hub / Explorer / and meeting place for developers, node operators and users who want to use the Chainlink protocol without the need to interact with ChainlinkLabs, so they allow any developer or community governed effort to pick whatever node they see fit. However it’s worth noting that their approach of using security reviewed nodes operated by independent teams with strong DevOps background has been proven efficient so far.",85,87.0,2021-02-28

['Oracle Infrastructure: Chainlink Proposal'],"Hey everyone, Johann here, I’d like to weigh in here and provide my insights. I work as the head of integrations over at Chainlink Labs and I’m quite happy to see this discussion shaping up.
I see Compound as one of the leading protocols within the DeFi space so I’m excited to work with the community and figure out the ways Chainlink oracles can be used to solve some of the oracle related issues the protocol is currently running into.
We want to support this proposal however we can and will begin by taking steps towards what could lead to a vote for a mainnet implementation in the coming weeks. Our price feeds currently cover all the live Compound markets on the Kovan testnet (Ethereum Price Feeds). In the coming days, we will launch a version of the Comptroller which utilises Chainlink price feeds deployed on testnet and get some testing going on there. The community can observe and monitor this process and provide any feedback you have.
Once this is live and operational on testnet, I think we should see the conversation going on by discussing the kind of format the Compound specific feeds we’ll be launching should take. For example, should the Compound community have control over the feed’s Multisig (ability to add and remove oracle nodes), should the multisig be a combination of Compound community members and Chainlink node operators, should it be set to the Compound governance module for COMP holders to vote on, or should we just avoid any Multisig and set it to a burn address (which in my view would be a more risky approach long term as it’s always useful to be able to do changes in the set of node operators such as adding more nodes when more value is at stake etc…).
This is entirely a decision to be determined by the Compound community though and we will follow whatever the community thinks is best and we’ll work at your rhythm. Our main motivation here is to solve problems for you guys, letting you focus on managing Compound markets, as well as put the experience our node operators and network has had providing price feeds for the DeFi ecosystem in the last 2 years at the service of the Compound community and protocol. Lastly, I want to say thank you to Getty for creating this proposal and the Compound community for your support.

Compound Developer Community Call Notes
Wednesday, June 16, 2021
Getty Hill - Chainlink Oracle Development (starts at 1:12)

Getty provided a brief update that the Chainlink Price Feed proposal is live and in the active voting stage. Community members are encouraged to read more about the proposed price feed on the forum thread, and reach out to Getty with any questions.

Yaron Velner - cToken Migration (starts at 2:40)

Yaron Velner introduced an idea to migrate cWBTC from the legacy market to the new one, using a seizeAllowed function that takes legacy cWBTC collateral and an enterMarket function that deposits it to the new market on behalf of users. Yaron explained that there is still $100m of WBTC deposits in the legacy market even though it no longer accrues interest or COMP, creating a problem of fractured liquidity between the two WBTC markets. Robert Leshner pointed out that more broadly, this system would more efficiently deprecate legacy markets to completion, instead of leaving small balances in a number of deprecated markets. This would also improve the user experience for migrating from non-upgradable cTokens (ZRX, BAT, ETH) to the new ones, by avoiding the multiple transactions and gas costs associated with the change. You can read more about the migration idea on the accompanying forum post.

Max Wolff - cToken Upgrade Proposal (starts at 11:50)

Max discussed a cToken upgrade proposal that is currently in the review period of the governance system. This proposed upgrade takes 2.8% of the liquidation discount and transfers it to the cToken reserves, reducing the effective liquidator incentive to the historical baseline of ~5%. Max explained that the increased reverses help protect the protocol against the risk of insolvency due to cascading liquidations. You can read more about the migration idea on the accompanying forum post.

Dennison Bertram - Gas Refunder Contract (starts at 14:50)

Dennison provided an update that development on Tally’s onchain gas refunder is now finished. The refunder reimburses 95% of gas costs for transactions that don’t require identity, which includes operations like voting/delegating by signature, and executing, queueing, or cancelling proposals. Dennison shared a demo of a refunder example deployed on mainnet, and walked through the different fields for deploying a new contract. Tally is now looking for users who want to implement their first refunder, and plans to speak with the grants committee about funding refunds for users voting on governance proposals. Useful links for learning more and getting started with Tally’s gas refunder are provided here: management app, smart contracts, subgraphs, frontend.

"[""Project Galaxy - Helping to build Compound's first NFT-based Loyalty Campaign!""]","Hey guys! This is Pokka from Project Galaxy. Project Galaxy is a NaaS (NFT-as-a-service) infrastructure that empowers communities with gamified loyalty systems. We believe that community management is key to decentralized organizations and NFTs can be a perfect medium to power on-chain achievements and credentials. After talking with Calvin Liu, we want to share our plan here with all of you.

Sorry for being wordy because this proposal might take a minute for you guys to go through. Therefore, we have prepared some surprise gifts for you at the end of this proposal!**

Our Motivation

All communities need a suite of tools like CRM to identify its long-term contributors and manage member relationships. This is especially true for DAO and NFT and therefore are perfect mediums for this.
Traditional crypto marketing campaigns like airdrop don’t help much with user retention and engagement.


How Can Project Galaxy Help Compound Finance:
Galaxy Protocol contains plug-and-play modules that allow communities to create customized NFT-powered campaigns based on their needs. With our V1 launch, we recommend three campaign templates for Compound Finance to kick off their NFT journey:

Background Story Ideas for the NFT Collection
We believe Compound Finance can build a new world of DeFi, so we recommend a brand story similar to creating your own SimCity. Community members can participate in different campaigns to collect architecture NFTs, Land NFTs of different dimensions and landscape NFTs. Eventually, users will be able to forge the buildings they have collected to build a city (City NFTs). Different NFTs would have different scarcity or power levels.

1. Governance Campaign - Mission
Reward those who actively participate in the Compound governance with different kinds of architecture NFTs.
NFT Collection Theme in this mission: For example, a skyscraper, a cathedral, Japanese garden…
Rules:

Each vote you have cast will allow you to claim 2 Mystery Boxes
Each Mystery Box will give you 1 random NFT out of the 6 different architectures.


2. Supply (cToken) Campaign - Mission
Reward those who hold cTokens with landscape NFTs.
NFT Collection Theme in this mission: Beach, mountain, rainforest, desert
Rules:

Holding at least $500 worth of cTokens for 5/20/35/50/65/80 days gives you the chance to claim 1/2/3/4/5/6 additional Mystery Boxes. (e.g. holding for 5 days = 1 Mystery Box, holding for 20 days = 2 additional Mystery Boxes, etc.)
Each Mystery Box will give you 1 random NFT out of the 4 different landscapes.


3. Borrow Campaign - Mission
Rewards those who borrow $100 worth of assets for 1/5/10/15/20 days
NFT Collection Theme in this mission: 2x2 land, 3x3 land, 4x4 land in the form of card
Rules:

Users who have borrowed $100 worth of assets for 1/5/10/15/20 days, will receive a chance to claim 1/2/3/4/5/6 Mystery Boxes.
Each Mystery Box will give you 1 random NFT out of the 3 different sizes of land.


Forging Campaign
Allow community members to forge collected NFTs from previous missions into Mega City NFTs.
Rules:

There will be 3 levels of the City NFTs (2x2 City, 3x3 City and 4x4 City), and each level has 3 different City designs.
The NFTs that the users claim from the borrow campaign will determine the level/size of the final product. The NFTs from Governance campaign and Supply campaign have different scarcity scores. To mint the final City NFTs, you will be required to provide at least 3 NFTs from those 2 campaigns. The total scarcity scores of the NFTs users supply will determine the final City in that certain level.

These are just some of the draft ideas. They are open for suggestions and discussions within the community so together we can make this NFT campaign for Compound the best in the blockchain space!

Such Achievement-based NFT Campaigns Can Help Compound with

Stronger branding through the issuance of customized NFTs
Better form of rewards that inspires community members’ ownership
Create something fun to increase community engagement and retention
Promote governance and protocol usage through NFT gamification
Identify long-term and core contributors in the community


Fees Involved

1. Minting cost
What is this?

The minting fee charged is used to cover the transaction fee that Galaxy team pays to the network. This is not for Galaxy to gain any profits.
Note that this is in addition to the transaction fee that users need to pay. When users initiate a claim transaction on-chain, our service listens to that event, checks user eligibility and initiates a minting transaction.

How is the minting cost determined?

It varies depending on gas price of the network.
The minting cost is calculated using the past 7 day avg gas price on Ethereum.

Why do we need this?

The reason that we don’t let the players claim and mint directly is that it’s expensive to have all the whitelist data on-chain (since this is dynamic and the list of addresses is huge). So we incorporated an oracle service involving subgraph queries to check user eligibility.

Access to control minting cost can be given to the Compound team if needed.

2. Platform fee
The platform fee is charged when users claim the NFT. It is a $2 flat fee paid in equivalent $ETH or $BNB on top of the minting cost. And it will be charged along with the minting cost to users in one transaction.
Fees will be collected by the Galaxy community treasury and further support the development of the Galaxy infrastructure.
The fee can be waived if the developer chooses to compensate on behalf of users.

What’s Next?
We will be launching Galaxy V1 and the first set of Compound NFT campaigns soon. While we gather initial feedback from community members through these campaigns, we will be preparing for the next set of Compound campaigns that aim to reward community members that contribute to different parts of the Compound ecosystem.
In the long run, we expect more community members can be more directly involved in the process of campaign/design creation. We are really excited to work alongside the Compound community on this.
Please don’t hesitate to comment under this post or on the Compound channel of Project Galaxy Discord. Looking forward to hearing your feedback!

['Seize all cWBTC legacy collateral and transfer its WBTC it to cWBTC2'],"cWBTC still holds over $100m in WBTC deposits, as it seems mostly by uninformed users.
The token bares 0 interest, and thus users do not gain anything by holding it.
Moreover, Compound as a protocol suffer because of it. First because of liquidity fragmentation, and second because it is not presented at the Compound website interface.
I also have a personal agenda, as the founder of B.Protocol, we have a user with over $10m in legacy WBTC deposits, who seems to be uninformed of the new cWBTC, and we do not have any way to notify him.
The proposed solution is to upgrade the comptroller such that seizeAllowed will allow a dedicate new smart contract to seize any legacy cWBTC collateral, and also to call enterMarket to cWBTC2, on behalf of the seized account.
The dedicated smart contract will withdraw the WBTC and deposit them in cWBTC2, and will transfer the cWBTC2 back to the seized account.

There could be an issue if a smart contract is the collateral owner, and does not have a functionality to handle cWBTC2, and I am willing to investigate it further, if there is a positive vibe from the community towards implementing such change.

Not necessary at all, I was under the impression that you might want to minimize changes at the comptroller code itself.
It will also cause a re-entry call to the comptroller (comptroller.migrate=>cWBTC.seize=>comptroller.seizeAllowed) but nonReentrant modifier is not used at the comptroller, so it should be ok.",29,5.6,2021-06-10

cWBTC still holds over $100m in WBTC deposits, as it seems mostly by uninformed users.


That’s just seems to you. For somebody else it might look as the opposite, like informed concious choice by users, to hold their assets in non-upgradeble contract, rather than in upgradeble. You do check code once, and stay well, rather then checking it all the time for it to not be “upgraded” to some noncense like seizures.
I strongly believe that absolutely zero functionality making possible to seize anything for any sort of “upgrade” or “benefit to user” should even exist in codebase.
Every action should be only be possible to be initiated exclusevely by user, and not by contract and/or governance.
Apps, build OVER Compound could have such functionality, where user is well aware beforehand and specifically delegate that rights to smart contract.
For base protocol i strongly oppose that.",24,9.6,2021-06-12

This is a legit opinion, however compound protocol seems to transition to mostly upgradable contracts.

['TrueUSD Listing Proposal'],"Hello - I’m Rafael, CEO of TrustToken, and our team would like to propose listing TrueUSD on Compound.
We believe TUSD would be a valuable addition to Compound as it has reliable live price feeds, strong community interest, and sufficient market liquidity.
Down the road, other TrueCurrencies, such as TCAD, TAUD, TGBP, and THKD, could also add value to the Compound platform by allowing users to on-ramp via their native currencies or speculate on Forex with leverage.
917×194 33.6 KB
Why TrueCurrencies?
Popularity: TUSD has been listed on AAVE since 2019, currently ranks 3rd in market size among stablecoins on AAVE, and makes up 13.6% of AAVE’s total market size.
Largest AAVE markets at time of writing, sorted by Total Borrowed:
1600×1042 91.7 KB
If TrueUSD performed similarly on Compound, we expect that it would become Compound’s third-largest market in terms of total borrow (after DAI and USDC).
Transparency: TUSD is the only stablecoin with live attestations to corroborate TUSD out in the market with dollars held in escrow. These attestations are facilitated by top accounting firm Armanino, LLP.
Reliability: Based on DeFi Score, TUSD on AAVE has the highest trust rating of any fiat-backed stablecoin currently listed on the platform.
Liquidity: TUSD is at over $280M in market cap at the time of writing, ranking as the 4th largest stablecoin after USDT, USDC, and DAI. It enjoys deep liquidity on both centralized and decentralized exchanges.
DeFi Adoption: The MakerDAO community accepted our TUSD collateral application and is in the process of green-lighting TAUD, TGBP, and TCAD.
Status:

TUSD Proposal Poll: (99.99% voted “Yes”)

TGBP Greenlight Poll: (100% voted “Yes”)

TAUD Greenlight Poll: (100% voted “Yes”)

TCAD Greenlight Poll: (100% voted “Yes”)


Access: TUSD is widely available through both 1st party and 3rd party fiat-to-crypto on-ramps, creating a new entry point for both individual and institutional Compound users. You can mint and redeem it right here.
Differentiators
TrueCurrency holders can rest assured that their tokens are actually redeemable 1:1 for Fiat by checking our real-time attestation of reserves.
We are working to bring this data on-chain in the coming months through partnerships with Oracle providers.
Because TAUD, TCAD, TGBP, and THKD are not pegged to the US dollar, Compound users in those respective jurisdictions would be able to participate in DeFi without taking on Forex risk by leveraging TrueCurrencies and borrowing from Compound against their native fiat currency.
Legal Info
TrueCoin, LLC, manages the smart contracts of TrueCurrencies. It is a wholly-owned subsidiary of TrustLabs, Inc, which is a Delaware, USA registered company.
Independent, third-party banks and trust companies in the United States and Hong Kong manage the fiat collateral backing TUSD in escrow accounts held for the benefit of all TUSD holders.
TrueCurrencies are fiat-backed stablecoins that are fully-collateralized (1:1 backed) with fiat held by banks and trust companies.
Weaknesses
TAUD, TCAD, TGBP, and THKD have lower liquidity when compared to TUSD. However, for each of our stablecoins the Compound community is open to onboarding, TrustToken can commit to providing $1mm of liquidity at the time of listing to seed the market.

['TrueUSD Listing Proposal'],"Hey @arr00, we do believe TrueUSD would have strong demand on Compound and would be one of the most popular assets. As I mentioned earlier, TrueUSD makes up a significant amount of AAVE’s total market size (increased since my original post from 13.6% to now being 14.3%) and is the third most borrowed asset on the platform.
We think similarly that if TrueUSD were listed on Compound it would be one of the most demanded assets, likely ranking third (after DAI and USDC) in terms of total borrow.
The other TrueCurrencies (TAUD, TGBP, TCAD, and THKD) are smaller products than TrueUSD, and would likely have less total demand, but would allow Compound users to directly on-ramp via many different fiat currencies which is not possible today.
On centralization- unlike most other stablecoins, the TrueUSD smart contract is owned by a special security management smart contract which requires additional signatures for larger mints. This protects token holders and DeFi protocols such as Compound. TrueUSD is also the only stablecoins to have real-time audits, adding a further layer of protection for DeFi protocols such as Compound. Finally, we’re now working on getting the balances backing TrueUSD reported on-chain by oracles, and we’ll have more updates on this project soon.

Most of the pitch above is talking about other platforms – what are the benefits and risks to COMP holders of adding it to the platform? Do you have data on usage overlap with the existing users? Would it add anything new?",54,90.8,2020-08-26
['TrueUSD Listing Proposal'],"@rleshner- the benefit to $COMP holders is diversification beyond the 2 assets that drive the overwhelming majority of Compound usage today, as well as significant increased usage of the platform, something that, right now, our stablecoins are the assets most likely to provide.
Compound is one of the DeFi projects that I personally am most excited about. It’s got great technology, great design, and a widely respected token model. I think it’s going to be successful long-term, but to get there, it’s going to need to have more than 2 assets with significant usage. Let’s look at the numbers. Compound today lists 9 assets:
image1008×74 7.5 KB
image1006×74 6.35 KB
image1006×74 8.56 KB
image1004×74 8.1 KB
image1008×73 7.28 KB
These are 5 of Compound’s 9 assets, and their total borrow, combined, is only 17.4mm. This constitutes about 1.8% of Compound’s total borrow. Their supply interest rates range from 0.00% to a low 1.11%.
image1004×71 6.48 KB
image1006×74 6.79 KB
The next two assets have a little more usage, together totaling 48.6mm in total borrow. This is about 5% of Compound’s total borrow.
image1002×76 8.56 KB
image1006×76 7.77 KB
These two assets (both stablecoins) make up 93% of Compound’s total borrow. It’s a significant risk to the platform to have only two assets making up such a large percentage of total borrow.
Because 7/9 assets on Compound, a platform for lending and borrowing crypto, have limited demand today for lending or borrowing, just two assets make up 93% of Compound’s total borrow (as well as 69% of its total supply).
Just to be clear, that means that all 7 other assets listed on Compound, all combined, make up <7% of the total borrow.

Given that both of the highly-demanded assets are stablecoins, the hypothesis I’d propose is that, by
far, what people are interested in lending and borrowing, today, are stablecoins.
Could this just be an anomaly because users are borrowing and lending Dai to farm $COMP? Unlikely, given that AAVE also has 92% of its total borrow from stablecoins, even though it lists different products.
But unlike Compound, their usage is more diversified: their top two assets only constitute 58.6% of their total borrow, and we’re working with them to list additional non-USD stablecoins that can diversify their platform further.

Looking at the usage data from both lending platforms suggests that while not all stablecoins make big markets, all big markets, today, are stablecoins.
How this collaboration can benefit $COMP holders
We’re an issuer that’s bringing to the table 5 highly trustworthy stablecoins, both USD and non-USD. If the Compound community is interested in diversifying and creating new markets that get significant usage, we think these products are the best bet. There isn’t any other partner where you can get this potential for growth and diversification, while only taking on the risk of a single issuer.
Right now, Compound’s listings don’t correspond to what people (and smart contracts) actually want to lend and borrow: stablecoins. For example, while Augur, WBTC, and BAT are excellent projects, it’s no surprise that they receive tepid usage on Compound given how much usage they get elsewhere. As a comparable, these three products are all also listed on AAVE and, all combined, make up <1% of AAVE’s total borrow. Compound’s situation could be radically different but that’s not what the data suggests.
When it comes to stablecoins, TrueCurrencies meet or exceed the level of trust of existing stablecoins on the platform.

Based on DeFi Score, TUSD on AAVE has the highest trust rating of any fiat-backed stablecoin currently listed on the platform, higher than DAI, USDC, and USDT, all of which are already listed on Compound. Why?
TrueCurrencies are the only stablecoins with 24/7 live audits to prove each TrueCurrency is always fully backed. These audits are facilitated by top accounting firm Armanino, LLP.
We’re now working with oracles to become the only stablecoins to live report collateralization on-chain.
Unlike some other stablecoins, purchasing and redeeming TrueCurrencies is easy. Just go here.

We think this is a natural partnership and are very ready to invest in making it successful for both projects. Thank you for engaging with us, we’re looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this.",55,251.0,2020-08-26

 rleshner:

the majority of TUSD comes from the Curve “yCurve pool”, which currently has 268M of TUSD (supplied to Aave); and some basic block exploration shows that the majority of TUSD borrowed is for the same yCurve pool


My understanding is that the yCurve pool puts TUSD into yEarn which uses a variety of strategies to pursue yield. Right now it primarily puts TUSD into AAVE but it could put a significant amount of TUSD into Compound were that possible. We see smart contracts such as yEarn as fully legitimate users of platforms such as Compound- they are ultimately just another gateway by which end-users access Compound.



 rleshner:

Do you have data on usage overlap with the existing users?


This is difficult to acquire given that most existing compound users are anonymous Ethereum addresses, and listing TrueCurrencies would bring many new users to the platform.

Also, to make it easy for busy folks, here’s a bullet-point summary of the key reasons we think listing $TUSD adds value for $COMP holders:


Listing TUSD on Compound will benefit $COMP holders through increased TVL and usage


Usage data suggests that on Compound, stablecoins are over 2x more popular than all other coins combined. The importance of this result is difficult to overstate.


As of Aug 26th, 93% of Compound’s total borrow (as well as 69% of its total supply) came from 2 assets, both stablecoins


This means the remaining 7 assets, all together, comprised 7% of total borrow


Listing TUSD will help diversify Compound, whose goal is to be a interest rate protocol for crypto, not for just 2 assets.


The overwhelming demand for stablecoins is not limited to compound-  measured at the same time, AAVE also had 92% of its total borrow from stablecoins


TUSD is one of the largest stablecoins globally, after the 3 stablecoins already listed on Compound


While USDC has trusted brand-names like Coinbase behind it, when you look at what fiat-backed stablecoins are actually doing to be transparent and build trust, TUSD comes out as #1 globally.


For example, TUSD is the only USD-backed stablecoin to ever have 24/7 real-time 3rd-party audits and has the highest DeFi Score of any stablecoin listed on AAVE, higher than USDC, DAI, and USDT, all of which are already listed on Compound.

['Celo x Compound Finance & Compound Chain'],"By Keyko
Proposal
The Celo community is excited by the announcement of Compound Chain. We firmly believe that Compound Chain will unlock new opportunities for Compound users, enabling the inclusion of a whole new class of assets from multiple chains and will help the platform reach a larger number of DeFi enthusiasts.
We propose contributing to the ongoing effort of the Compound community in launching Compound Chain by deploying the Celo Starports, contributing to Compound Chain oracles, and by building tooling that will make it easier for Compound Chain validators to read Starport events from the Celo chain.
image1307×725 109 KB
Further, we also propose deploying the Compound smart contracts on the Celo blockchain (Celo-Compound), to create a second ‘local’ market for natively tradable assets on the Celo network (e.g. CELO, cUSD, cEUR, tBTC, and the dozens of other regional and community currencies launching on Celo in the near future). This market can be used as a sort of ‘Minor League’ which can provide a useful signal to the COMP community for whether there are any additional assets that should be considered for bridging to the main Compound instance running on the Compound Chain.
There will be no governance token on Celo-Compound and all governance will initially be conducted by a multisig group which executes the will of COMP governance from Ethereum.
image1277×705 105 KB
Motivation
Celo’s aim to bring access to financial instruments to the wider public through its mobile-first approach will be greatly enhanced by the ability to lend and borrow on the platform. cUSD is intended for use in everyday commerce and hence there is a clear incentive for users to borrow cUSD against their holdings to pay for transactions and also as an incentive for holders of cUSD to receive interest on funds in their Valora wallet (Celo’s payment focused mobile wallet).
Because the Celo platform has a scalable and mobile friendly consensus protocol, is fully EVM compatible, and supports tokens for paying for transaction fees, it is an ideal platform to build easy to use mobile experiences that reach a large number of non-crypto savvy users looking for financial services that would otherwise be unavailable to them.
Compound Chain will provide an ideal mechanism for these users to borrow and lend assets in the broader crypto ecosystem. Further, since Celo is fully EVM compatible, much of the work needed to bridge to Celo can be reused from the Ethereum effort. As a result, Celo can serve as a great initial integration with a low amount of complexity and additional work.
Governance
For the minor instance of Compound running on Celo, it is desirable to have the COMP community own all governance decisions. Hence the initial proposal for governance is to establish a multisig group of trusted COMP and CELO holders to execute the will of any governance decisions carried out on Ethereum. This multisig group would have the freedom to automate this process once appropriate bridges exist.
To minimize the risk of multisig holders colluding with each other, each multisig holder could put up a bond on Ethereum that could be slashed through governance by the COMP community should any multisig holder misbehave.
Longer term, this multisig would be deprecated in favor of reading and applying governance decisions directly from the Ethereum chain, ideally via the Starport to the Compound Chain.
Challenges
This proposal comes with a set of incentive challenges that we would need to address or minimize:
Incentivizing CELO liquidity
Since the Celo network has only recently launched, CELO holders bullish on the success of the network are likely highly motivated to hold CELO and thus to borrow assets (e.g. cUSD) while using CELO as collateral.
However, because the Celo network uses Proof-of-Stake for consensus, holders of CELO can receive approximately 6% APY by locking and voting on a validator group. Any CELO liquidity contributed towards Compound would have a 6% opportunity cost to overcome.
Initially, the roughly 50% of CELO that is currently not voting (and thus not earning 6% rewards) will be available immediately for use with Compound without paying this opportunity cost (~480M USD in value). If native support for liquidity providers is added to Valora then this will provide a seamless onboarding to users holding CELO on their mobile wallet. This fraction of non-voting CELO is expected to decrease in the long term however and thus, over time, it may make sense to support both CELO and non-voting CELO derivatives on the platform. A non-voting CELO derivative would capture voting rewards from the initial CELO deposit and thus not entail a 6% opportunity cost.
Trusted governance model
With respect to Celo-Compound, the goal of this proposal is to minimize complexity, hence avoiding issuing a new tradeable governance token at launch time. This does mean, however, that users of the platform will need to trust the actions of the multisign group. Moreover, users of Celo-Compound will be beholden to the will of COMP token holders without the opportunity to accumulate these tokens themselves.
While the average individual user often doesn’t have a significant role in governance decisions, it is important that these users trust that good decisions will be made. The multisig group will need to have an established trust basis and also commit to acting in the interests of Celo-Compound if COMP governance deviates from this.
Execution Plan
This section outlines the execution plan and proposed pricing and milestones for the work.
Milestones
As part of this proposal, we envision the following 4 milestones, starting with work on the Compound Chain, followed by the Celo instance of the Compound.
Compound Chain
First, we would like to help the Compound community in launching Compound Chain with a Celo integration. To that end, we will help add CELO and cUSD to the Open Price Feed, which Compound Chain will be using. Since CELO is available on Coinbase Pro and Uniswap (via wCELO), it should be relatively easy to add CELO to the price feed.
Next, we would like to contribute to and deploy the Starport contracts on the Celo chain. These should be similar to the Ethereum versions with the one difference that since Celo has 1-block finality, it may be possible to wait for fewer block confirmations than for the Ethereum counterparts. Moreover, tooling and testing will be provided to enable Celo wallets to communicate with Compound Chain via notices to the Starport contract.
Finally, we would like to build tooling that will make it easier for Compound Chain validators to run Celo full nodes so they can read Starport events from the Celo chain. Ideally, validators would run the fullnodes in a pre-packaged docker container to make it extremely easy for them to get going. Further, since Celo has a very efficient light client, new validators will be able to quickly sync with the chain using Celo’s fast syncing mode.
Celo Compound
Deploying Compound on the Celo network entails the deployment of Compound contracts in a Celo-compatible manner, replacing the governance module by an audited multisig, indexing these contracts for easy consumption by a GraphQL client and providing a web and mobile user interface that is compliant with the Celo mobile Dappkit framework.
Deploy Compound Contracts + Multisig
Next, we’ll move to the Celo instance of Compound, first by deploying the Compound contracts on the Celo test network (Baklava). This will allow our smart contract engineers to become familiar with the compound API and deployment. The estimated time for this is 3 weeks, with the following steps: functional analysis, development, deployment and network integration.
The functional analysis will map out the existing contract domain space and identify common components and change requirements for the Celo-Compound deployment on the Celo networks (mainnet and baklava testnet). This includes ensuring VM, transaction and contract compatibility as well as Celo-Compound configuration such as support for cUSD and CELO and design for the multi-sig governance module.
The outcome of this work is a process of change requests that are managed in an agile development environment with OKRs, milestones, tickets, CI/CI, devops and merge policies.
Launch Indexing API (Blockscout)
Next, any dapp built on top of the smart contracts will need access to an indexer. We are intimately familiar with the indexer used by Blockscout, the block explorer that Celo uses, and so we can quickly use it to index the necessary data, and expose it to the community using Blockscout’s graphgl endpoint.
The tasks in this module include adding the Celo-Compound contracts to the blockscout Indexer, updating the schema of the underlying DB repository and exposing those schemas through graphql as well as updating the web frontend of the explorer with newly designed pages.
Launch Mobile-first Dapp
Finally, we will work on a mobile-first dapp (either web or native mobile app) so that regular consumers will be able to access the service.
The app will be designed in alignment to the current compound.finance dapp interface and integrated with the Celo client and wallet to support access to the Celo-Compound contracts and state.
Team
About Keyko: Keyko GmbH is a Swiss based development house focusing on web3 and digital ecosystems. Established in 2019, we have successful collaborations with flagship projects such as Celo, Filecoin, Bancor, Orange and others. The Keyko team has 20+ employees and is full-stack delivery oriented.
For ensuring the completion of above milestones, the following roles have been identified:
Product Delivery
Analysis and specification of requirements. Architectural design and handover to engineering. Follow up and iterate on requirements and gather feedback from stakeholders and community.
This role will also manage the agile process.
Backend Delivery
This role will oversee delivery of following components.


Compound-Chain


Starport contracts


Validator integration


Celo-Compound

Compound Finance contracts
MultiSig wallet
Block Explorer



Each product will be delivered with regular release cycles.
Frontend Delivery
Both a designer and a frontend engineer will be required for the Celo-Compound mobile-first dapp.
Devops
Each product component requires packaging for deployment and continuous integration. This role will also account for setting up test environments and support on operational security.
Estimated Effort
Total effort: 18 person months:

Project duration: 4-5 months, starting upon approval of the grant
Total development effort: 15 person months
Support & maintenance after delivery : total of 3 person months over the duration of the project (included into delivery effort)

Total budget: 500.000,00 USD:

250.000,00 USD in $COMP
250.000,00 USD in $CELO

The Celo Foundation has committed to funding half of this work assuming this proposal passes.

Payment Terms
We are open to whatever payment terms make sense the most for the COMP community. Ideally, we would be paid after completing each milestone from a multisig contract, however, if that is logistically too complicated, we would be open to splitting the payment into three chunks:

20% paid upfront
40% paid on delivery of Celo on Compound Chain
40% paid delivery of Compound Finance on Celo

It seems like you guys know way more than what is publicly available about Compound Chain. I would be interested to know if there is any kind of existing relationship or anything that could be extruded as a relationship between the Celo and Compound Finance Labs Team.

['Celo x Compound Finance & Compound Chain'],"Hi @getty
Thanks for your comments.  I tried to address them:


We (Keyko) have a long standing working relationship with Celo Foundation. And we have a lot of respect for the Compound Finance Labs Team. After hearing about compound chain we’ve started developing the idea of integrating Compound Chain and Celo. For relationships between Compound and the Celo Foundation, I’ll defer to the parties involved


There is not development info available on compound chain, but as we can derive from what’s published and talks with @rleshner we estimate that the both milestones can be achieved within 4 months. Given that compound chain proposal is more an integration effort than a product design effort we assume this milestone to be delivered much faster. Of course, having access to a development docs/sandbox/code would help us identifying the devil in the details


Keyko GmbH is independent from Celo and Compound. We’re a self-funded web3 company that aims to add value to the web3 space by recognizing opportunity and synergy

",64,87.8,2021-02-01
['Celo x Compound Finance & Compound Chain'],"Thanks @dimi. This looks like a thoughtful approach. A couple questions:


Can you expand a bit on the thinking re: deploying a separate Compound instance on Celo (in addition to facilitating the integration with Compound Chain)? You mention that it could serve as a sort of ‘Minor League’ version that provides a signal as to which assets should be added to the main Compound Chain. But is there also the potential that it could lead to fragmented liquidity between the two versions once they are both running at scale?


You mention that you’ll work on a mobile-first dapp (either web or native mobile). Is it feasible that this functionality could be integrated directly into Valora, or does it need to be a standalone app?


Can you expand on your plan re: security and testing of the code pre-launch? What portion, if any, would go towards audits, etc?


What would the next steps be in terms of moving forward towards a formal governance proposal?


Thanks!

['Celo x Compound Finance & Compound Chain'],"Thanks for the thoughtful comments @jamico . (sorry for the delayed reply, the notification got burried)


The minor league is a potential on-ramp to compound chain where initially CELO/cUSD and COMP/CASH would be the major liquidity providers. The more demand from the minor league to other assets, the more the starport will lock up CELO/cUSD + COMP/CASH to access the major league. We’d regard it as a success when liquidity starts off-ramping from Compound Chain to minor league assets would lock up more  CELO/cUSD and COMP/CASH as they’re the bridge and relay assets.


Integration in Valora is a great idea. Considering Valora has a production and feature release cycle, having the mobile app integrated would require c-Labs to plan the feature integration in the future. We consider a separate mobile app using the dAppKit SDK as a great starting point to test out the compound features on the Celo Network. This allows target focus groups, feedback and voice of community. Upon success the stand-alone app can be promoted to c-Labs as a Valora integration. But that feels out of scope for this grant


Thanks for pointing this out. We’re fully aligned to ensure excellence in delivery, audits included:




Compound Chain: We assume that the Starport smart contracts are being audited by Compound Finance and come with appropriate implementation and operational guidelines to deploy the smart contracts on EVM compatible networks such as Celo. Here we’re happy to collaborate with auditors that have engaged with Compound Chain. For the client-side implementation, we can collaborate with the Celo Core team to make sure the transactional guidelines and wallet KMS patterns are followed. Additionally, we can assist to improve operational excellence for the Compound Chain Oracles that will feed the prices of CELO and cUSD, if needed.


Celo Compound:  Here, we identify two main modules that require additional audit oversight. First the Open Price Feed will require the cTokens to receive oraclized inputs from a set of trusted signers. Hereto, CELO and cUSD are already oraclized on-chain. Minor League ERC20 tokens on the Celo Network will most likely get their initial price feed from Uniswap-style market makers such as UbeSwap (obviously subject to low-liquidity slippage). Secondly the governance module is swapped out with a mature Multisig implementation. This would require auditing on the correct connection of roles and delegates from the multisig signer to the compound finance contracts.


Budget based on past experience ranges between 30-50k USD for the scope.
If this sounds about right, we can update the proposal and allocate a budget to ensure the novelties are audited. Our preference would be to reach out to auditors that have subject matter expertise on the modules mentioned above.

I think next steps would be to:


Iron out some of the details mentioned above.
The Celo community has expressed their commitment to move this forward cc/ @marek

Find enough COMP support for this idea to move to an on-chain proposal as described here . Hereby we would like to learn more on how to practically set up the transactions that allow COMP voters to approve the release of tokens according to the schedule that’s in the on-chain proposal.

Hope this helps.

Getty posted the deployed contracts and Trail of Bits audit to the community forum and was planning to create a CAP as soon as later today. Robert Leshner shared feedback that the community will likely need additional time to review the contracts, in order to gain confidence that this implementation of Chainlink will perform as expected. Getty and Johann plan to further explain the testing that has already been done, as well as post new analysis. All members of the community are encouraged to review this implementation in detail and share any findings on the forum thread or development channel in Discord.

Allthecolors - Retroactive COMP Airdrop (starts at 20:10)

Allthecolors talked about the current state of the Retroactive COMP Airdrop proposal, which has been the most active forum post on comp.xyz. This proposal seeks to distribute COMP to early Compound users, in order to further decentralize governance and reward the earliest contributors with voting power. The community has debated a couple of approaches to the distribution, one being distributing a flat amount to users who interacted with the protocol, and the other being weighting the distribution based on the amount of capital and length of time that each user deployed assets to the protocol. Allthecolors received a grant to build a more robust analysis of early users, which looks at the interest generated by supplying/borrowing to determine the distribution amount. Allthecolors is looking for feedback on where to get price data for this analysis (currently scraping CoinGecko for this information), and how to handle distributions to contracts in addition to individual users.

['1INCH Listing Proposal [Stay Tuned]'],"Summary:
This is a proposal for adding the 1inch token (1INCH) to Compound.
Background:
1inch Network is arguably one of the most reputable and trusted ecosystems that unites decentralized protocols whose synergy enables the most lucrative, fastest and protected operations in the DeFi space.
1INCH is an ERC-20 utility & governance token, and the 1inch Network is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). 1inch is unique in that it provides instant governance for its users. This feature allows 1inch users to vote for specific protocol settings in the DAO model. The instant governance makes it easier for token holders to make changes to the protocol and circumnavigates many of the inefficiencies of many current DAO models.
Why 1INCH?

Popularity

1INCH has been listed on Coinbase, Binance and other significant exchanges currently ranks in the top 100 of total coins by market capitalization. 1INCH has a flourishing community of over 200,000+ members across multiple online channels, as well as more than 178,000+ active wallets and 51,000+ token holders. We believe that the addition of our token to Compound will step up activity on the platform and provide a vast number of opportunities to the communities of both projects.

Transparency

1INCH is an ERC-20 utility & governance token, and the 1inch Network is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). 1inch is unique in that it provides instant governance for its users. This feature allows 1inch users to vote for specific protocol settings in the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) model.

Liquidity

1INCH is at over $890M in market cap at the time of writing. It enjoys deep liquidity on both centralized and decentralized exchanges.

Defi Adoption

1INCH is an active project in the Defi ecosystem and has already submitted applications to the MakerDAO and AAVE communities.
Contract information
1INCH token:
Audits
Safety & Next Steps
To ensure the safety of the Compound protocol, we must carefully manage risk. In this case, we can do this by fine-tuning the collateral factor, reserve factor, and borrowing limits for $1INCH.
1INCH Foundation would like to open up a discussion as to what the optimal initial values of these risk-related factors should be.
Once we come to a majority agreement on this, the $1INCH Foundation will create an autonomous proposal to be voted on by everyone.
So with respect to $1INCH, what do you think are optimal initial values for:

Collateral factor
Reserve factor
Borrowing limit

We look forward to receiving feedback from the community and moving forward with the future application, as we believe $1INCH would be a valuable addition to Compound with its reliable live price feeds, strong community interest, and sufficient market liquidity.

['1INCH Listing Proposal [Stay Tuned]'],"I want 1inch on the Compound Protocol!
Compound could even use 1Inch’s API for price feeds, maybe?
It would be beneficial to Compound, 1Inch’s exchange and users if there was a deeper collaboration and marketing of something totally new to DeFi the 2 teams could integrate! 1Inch and Compound could add a few cToken pools on the 1inch exchange with COMP and 1inch farming rewards! The ability to have a large enough liquidity for trading cTokens would be a gamechanger for the 1inch token and would allow 1inch users to more easily become Compound suppliers. The collaboration could also provide 1inch holders and Compound users additional 1inch token farming rewards for supplying or borrowing the 1inch token on the Compound Protocol.
1inch and Compound may even want to have an addition added to their UI’s for users who are on both platforms. Could add a COMP reward balance and claim button on 1inch. While COMP could add 1inch’s staked balance and reward claim button.
There really is sooo much 1inch and Compound could do to REALLY make a splash!!! So, PLEASE @1inchnetwork, don’t settle for just getting added to Compound’s list of assets, think outside the box and 1up the DeFi ecosystem. Do something different with staking LP-1inch-cTokens.
Just curious, if a liquidity provider adds cTokens to a pool, could you make that contract be able to accept the COMP rewards, or distribute them directly back to the LP’s COMP reward balance which is displayed at the top of the Compound app? There has to be something new 1inch/Compound could do for LP’s adding liquidity with cTokens and then staking their LP-cTokens. I just think it would be interesting to add the liquidity of Compound’s left-over supply market to 1inch’s pools. Could it reduce the gas fee to provide liquidity to Compound’s supply markets?",27,85.4,2021-05-24

Initial collateral factor should be 50% or less, then possibly increase as governance sees fit and as liquidity increases. However, governance will probably want it set to 0% initially.
The reserve factor should be set to 15 - 25%.
Borrow limit should be set to 50% of supply.
Has 1inch thought about adding an initial supply to the market to boost borrowing? If so, how much? What will be done with the interest? Who will get the COMP rewards? Also, would 1inch use the minted c1inch tokens to create a pool on their platform, enabling borrowing of the 1inch token via swapping?
A while back, I was thinking about adding a pool to 1inch with cUSDC and ETH, but couldn’t provide enough liquidity to get it on the first page of the pair list.

From what I understood so far, and correct me if I’m mistaken if you send USDC to the USDC pool without the mint function, it becomes extra interest to all the Compound USDC pool users so all USDC suppliers get a proportional part of it. So the only way to recover it, I thought would be to have to ask each USDC supplier if they’d be willing to return the unintended funds if there was even a way to know who they were and what they’d received.
If the funds just sat in the pool and weren’t distributed then I hoped there could be a way in the future to assign the funds back to myself, or if there was a way in the future to re-direct the same amount of interest I sent out to everyone back to me at a random time, or if there was a way for me to borrow Compound’s money interest-free and put it in a Compound pool until it generates the same amount in interest… I have a lot of hope, just no idea how realistic any of it is.

"['I Donated 78,000 USDC to the Compound USDC Pool']","This has been done before at proposal 37. Check the description there, it lays out the framework for how it will be conducted. Here it is:
This proposal acts to establish a policy for returning accidentally sent funds accessible by Governance under the following terms.

Sender must verify their identity through a signature or on-chain calldata and request return of funds on the compound forums within 6 months of accidental transfer
Funds will only be returned to the originating address
A 10% penalty will be imposed
The sent funds must have a minimum value of $1,000 at the time of the post
At most, once every six months, a proposal will be made that returns all funds eligible under these terms

Currently, there is one eligible transaction, and this proposal acts to return the locked funds under the terms stated above. In order to do so, we must set a new implementation for cUNI which adds the sweepToken functionality. It additionally removes unused verify callbacks resulting in minor gas savings on most interactions. This code change was developed in the open and reviewed by community members. Full testing has been done including unit tests and forking simulations. Due to the limited scope of the changes, they have not been professionally audited.

"['I Donated 78,000 USDC to the Compound USDC Pool']","This transaction is definitely not eligible under the terms setup in proposal 37. This transfer is of a completely different type than what was setup there. The USDC has been dissolved into the cUSDC pool and distributed to all the holders.
Governance should do what is possible to return accidentally lost funds when it is recoverable. In this case the funds are completely unrecoverable, and asking Governance to refund would be asking Governance to take the hit instead of the user.
I would consider these funds completely lost with no chance of Governance refunding them. If Governance could, I think it would, but it is not possible.",55,86.0,2021-04-13

I want us to focus on the APY for a moment. I would argue that dissolving the funds and distributing them to the holders caused about a ~0.0027% increase in the APY for USDC. If it’s possible to tap into the 7% reserve kept in the USDC pool and extracted the funds from there, we would see a similar drop in APY while the reserve replenishes back to 7%, then the APY returns to the state it was at before the surprise distribution. The distribution caused a mild benefit to all the holders and a disproportionate loss to one, and since most holders are in it long term, and if they also agree that lost funds should be returned when possible, there may be a chance. Add a 10% penalty or more and a residual benefit to the APY will remain. A 20%, 30%, or 50% penalty may put more people at ease given the nature of this proposal.",51,25.2,2021-04-14

['Lower Proposal Threshold to 100 COMP'],"Currently it requires 100,000 COMP to propose governance actions (either directly owned or delegated). This puts governance proposals out of reach for all but a very small set of individuals and entities.
Additionally (my hypothesis) this creates selling pressure on COMP. There is little incentive to accrue COMP because meaningful participation in governance is out of reach.
One way to reason about this is: how much money do I need to make a proposal? Right now the answer would be ~$18 million (100,000 * 180). At 100 COMP to make a proposal the answer is $18,000 which seems appropriate. Within reach for highly motivated individuals.
There is also very little downside here. If we are flooded with proposals (a good thing!) we can 1) implement a COMP burn to make a proposal or 2) incremental raise the level.

I personally think it would be prudent to start with a relatively high proposal threshold (maybe 10k+ COMP) and then slowly work our way down until the volume of proposals starts to become significant.
We may also want to consider a testing period, where proposal submission still requires 100k COMP, but superdelegates offer to sponsor lesser backed proposals that meet certain community criteria.",70,104.0,2020-08-28

['Lower Proposal Threshold to 100 COMP'],"Thinking out loud (and probably an implausible idea): can we have a tiered system.
i.e. you can propose with 100 COMP, but for your proposal to pass, you need a higher quorum. you can also propose with 100,000 COMP, and quorum to pass stays the same.
more aggressively, we can have a formula
let x the number of COMP Alice has, such that x <100,000.
let y be the quorum requirement  for Alice’s proposal to pass, such that  0.04 < y <1
then the relation of x and y can be determine by a formula x*y = F, where F can be a constant or a formula.",58,66.6,2020-08-28

otherwise I fear it would become quite overwhelming to deal with the volume of proposals that will come.
i’d also argue that if we’re going to lower the COMP-threshold, we may want to consider some sort of “time in wallet” threshold. basically an address must have held 100 COMP for X number of blocks in order to submit a proposal.
in short, I’m open to the idea, but I’d like to see it approached with some caution",49,39.8,2020-08-29
['Lower Proposal Threshold to 100 COMP'],"I’ve expressed skepticism around lowering the proposal threshold before and I’ll expound on my reasoning.
My main concern mostly applies to proposals which involve deploying new contracts. I’d be more open to a low threshold to parameter changes as opposed to new contracts, but 100 COMP still seems too low.
The Compound protocol is controlling hundreds of millions of dollars in crypto assets supplied by thousands of users. In its current state, it is one of the best audited and safest DeFi applications out there and I think most users want it to stay that way.
With this taken into account, in order to make meaningful contributions to the protocol, you need to take a deep dive into the protocol and along the way, you’ll meet most of the incredible community. Proposal ideas need to be well thought out, implemented perfectly, and extensively tested (and often audited).
After getting community feedback and iterating to accommodate the needs of the community, you won’t have an issue finding someone to propose your update; I can tell you this from experience.
Another thing to take into account: we are only a few months into Compound decentralization out of the FOUR YEARS the whole process should take. Obviously this early on the community won’t have as much power as it will have in the coming years.
Overall, I believe that the proposals thus far have been highly thoughtful, comprehensive, and usually cater to the requests of the community. I’m concerned that lowering the threshold so much will create lots of spam, half-baked proposals, and sometimes proposing without discussing with the community first. If anyone wants to get a proposal made, feel free to ping me on discord and we can get it done right—even without lowering the proposal threshold.",51,40.2,2020-08-29

['Lower Proposal Threshold to 100 COMP'],"I’m thrilled by the enthusiasm to increase participation in Governance, and have some ideas on how the community can make this happen.
For background, these are the principles that guided the design of the Governance process (knowing that it can, and should, evolve over time):


Safety first. As @arr00 mentioned, the protocol manages hundreds of millions of dollars worth of assets. While changing parameters is generally “safe”, introducing new code & contracts is a tremendous risk. An overview to remind folks how proposals work.

Skin in the game. The proposal threshold was set high to ensure that only stakeholders or groups of stakeholders banding together (through delegation) would be able to propose changes.

Openness. You don’t have to be a large COMP holder in order to participate in governance. You can receive voting rights by demonstrating intelligence or a commitment to the protocol or a proposal, and garner public support. Because of delegation, (theoretically) anyone can change the protocol if they adhere to safety first and win the support of those with skin in the game.

While by some metrics, the protocol has succeeded wildly at Openness (see successful and pending proposals from @blck, @brendan_dharma, @arr00…), it’s clear from this thread and conversations in Discord that many folks feel like participation is out of reach.
Prior to launching Governance, our team had the hypothesis that individual members of the community would build a base of delegated support. So far, this hasn’t happened. It could be a function of missing incentives–or other causes that the community can analyze.
Solution 1 - Autonomous Proposals
The ability to delegate COMP opens up some very powerful opportunities that haven’t been fully explored.
Rather than delegating to a protocol politician or well-known community member (who, if they receive 100,000 COMP can create a proposal, act in their own interest, or vote for or against anything they want), what if you could delegate to a special-purpose smart contract–called an Autonomous Proposal.
Anybody that meets a low threshold of ownership (e.g. 100 COMP as @lay2000lbs suggests) could deploy an autonomous proposal, with the title, description, and governance actions that they would like to build support for. Community members can delegate to the autonomous proposal, watch it rise up the leaderboard, and when it reaches the proposal threshold–the proposal is formalized and voted on.
Autonomous proposals have the added benefit of providing additional visibility (and ability to audit and analyze) before going into the voting process–which meaningfully increases safety.
Solution 2 - Deploy a new Governance Contract
The “alpha” Governance contract was meant to be a starting point to test the parameters of the Governance process, and expand upon. A new contract could be written and deployed by the community, changing core parameters; lowering the proposal threshold (which itself would be much more attainable with autonomous proposals), increasing the vote delay, or reducing the quorum (voting requirement).",50,185.0,2020-08-30

Instead wasting their resources on pointless governance changes and wasting reserve by giving them to people to do supposed marketing

"['Oracle quirks, or why you might get liquidated even at 95% borrow limit']","Proposed UI fix: UI should keep track of current feed price by querying /oracle from Coinbase, and tell user to update prices if current actions will cause liquidation, or if prices are stale.
Issue tl;dr: Liquidator can choose any combination of valid Coinbase-signed reports since last update to submit (e.g. 4 hrs ago for COMP and latest for ETH), to liquidate users even if the UI doesn’t indicate a liquidation possibility.
That means what you think its a 95% borrow limit while you are unwinding your positions, is a tasty snack for liquidators.
Current status: Reported, Known issue
Current fix: Prior to skating too close to your borrow limits, update price yourself through this link https://app.compound.finance/prices
Issue
I was unwinding a position in Compound and took out my supply to pay off the borrowing, I targetted 97% borrow limit, but was hit by a liquidation bot in the same block as the withdrawal.
As it turns out, the MEV transaction invoked a pair of oracle update that set the ETH price to a 6 minute old price, and the COMP price to a 4 hour old price.
The transaction I’m referencing is 0x1afd5cf2f5a0989e9f9e1733ed4afa0511fccc97ce1de5d22e3c616063554f21, in block 12425678 (Thu May 11:09:09 2021 GMT+0)
Issue Details
Using an archive node, we can reconstruct the numbers:
Block 12425677:
ETH | Thu May 13 02:54:00 2021 | 3632.155000
COMP | Thu May 13 02:54:00 2021 | 779.720000
Block 12425678 (MEV tx block):
ETH | Thu May 13 11:03:00 2021 | 3610.690000
COMP | Thu May 13 07:15:00 2021 | 810.420000
As can be seen, the COMP value was 4 hours old, and based on the Coinbase charts it would have between $761 and $765 in the minute candle.
This would have resulted in a 1.5% correct difference in value instead of the actual 4.5% shift in value.
How you might be affected
The liquidator would have to keep polling the coinbase oracle and not post the data.
As long as the oracle smart contract is not kept updated by an honest reporter, the liquidator can post any combination of price and time to maximise the liquidation. In this case, the attacker had a window of 8 hours to choose any combination of prices within.
Suggested SC Fixes

I’m told that the price feed is in the middle of a massive overhaul: Oracle Infrastructure: Chainlink Proposal - #61 by jared

LiquidateBorrower should require both Oracle reports to be signed at the same time.
If for some reason the data isn’t available at the same time, there should be a sanity check against the uniswap oracle to see if it’s within limits.

Suggested UI Fixes before oracle overhaul

UI should keep track of current feed price by querying /oracle from Coinbase, and tell user to update prices if current actions will cause liquidation, or if prices are stale.

Dennison Bertram - Gas Refuner & Compound Subgraphs (starts at 1:20)

Dennison gave an update that the smart contract development and documentation of the gas refunder is now complete. The web application for the refunder is also almost complete, which will allow users to create and manage a refunder that reimburses various governance interactions like executing proposals, creating CAPs, voting by sig, etc. Once a user creates a refunder contract they can also add a validating function that will only refund interactions based on certain parameter thresholds. @Amxx also joined the call to share information about Compound Subgraph development. The goal for the project is to have a clear, well-written subgraph on Compound’s Governor Alpha contracts, so that any other projects using the same governance framework can simply fork and use it for their own project. This consistent tooling will also help third-party developers integrate governance information going forward.

Getty Hill - Chainlink Oracle Development (starts at 15:00)

Getty shared a brief update on the development of the Chainlink Oracle Solution.The final deployments of the Chainlink and Uniswap anchor view contracts will be completed in the next day or two, at which point the Chainlink team will publish the final documentation and Trail of Bits audit report to comp.xyz. Once the community has had a chance to review and discuss the proposed implementation, Getty plans to move forward with a governance proposal.

Patrick Ho - Account Health Notifications (starts at 16:39)

Patrick gave a presentation on his grants project, which is a notification service for borrowers on Compound. Rather than setting up a username and password, users can simply link their borrowing account to the service, and opt into email/sms notifications on borrowing health, market migrations, or potential exploits. The estimated development timeline is 9 weeks, with grant funding covering the first two months of operations once live. Patrick is looking for the community’s feedback on topics like storing sensitive user information, which variables to track, and how to efficiently make API calls, so reach out to @Patrickhmmmmm on Discord with any suggestions.

Max Wolff - Safety and Gas Patches (starts at 32:20)

Max discussed a few proposed changes that the Compound Labs team is working on to improve the cToken and Comptroller contracts. The first change allows borrowing positions to be liquidated in markets that have a 0% collateral factor, 100% reserve factor, and paused borrowing, in order to help suppliers remove liquidity from deprecated markets. This process would be gradual and communicated to all users to avoid unwanted liquidations. The other Comptroller change is a minor update to the Claim Comp function, in order to make it more gas efficient. Lastly, Max shared a proposed change to the seize function of the cToken contract that is called during the liquidation process, that allows the protocol to keep 3% of the current 8% liquidation reward, and add it to the reserves of that market. This approach maintains a strong 5% fee incentive for liquidators, while also building up a larger buffer of reserves to reduce the systemic risk of cascading liquidations.

['TrueUSD Listing Proposal [Stay tuned]'],"Hello, everyone from the Compound community. I am from the TrueUSD team. Our team would like to propose listing TrueUSD on Compound.finance.
We prepared 100,000 COMP and are ready to create the proposal at any time. However, we would love to hear the feedback from the community before we take the action. We also believe that compliance and transparency, the core value of TUSD will shine in the Defi realm with the help of the prosperity of the Compound ecosystem.
We need your support to help us to get listed!
Overview
TrueUSD (TUSD) is the first independently-verified digital asset redeemable 1-for-1 for US Dollars. The ERC20 stablecoin uses multiple banks, escrow accounts, and third-party attestations to reduce counterparty risk, provide transparency, and prevent fraud.
TUSD offers liquidity on dozens of leading exchanges, DeFi protocols, and is supported by major OTC desks. TUSD also supports nearly instant minting and redemption speeds through the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN) and PrimeX by PrimeTrust.
TrueUSD has built a bank-level compliance department that in unison with TrueCoins escrow partners ensures that only approved users can mint or redeem TrueUSD.
Token


Symbol: TUSD


Blockchain Type: ERC20, Avalanche, Binance Chain


TrueUSD in DeFi
Highly compliant and transparent stablecoin TUSD has now been listed on multiple DeFi platforms. Not only does TUSD have a high ranking among stablecoins in many rating agencies, but also in APR ranking on DeFi platforms.
On Curve.fi, there is a TUSD Metapool, by staking DAI, USDT, USDC, and TUSD, users can enjoy trading fee share and CRV mining rewards. The reward is currently around 30% and will reach 40% with an accelerator. On Uniswap, by providing liquidity to USD/ETH, users can gain a 17% APR. It can be a good choice when it comes to providing liquidity on Uniswap. As for SushiSwap, users can enjoy both trading fees and SUSHI mining rewards by providing liquidity of TUSD/wETH and the APY is up to 45.08% on Onsen.
Proposal Details
The details for TUSD on Compound are as follow:


Set collateral factor as 0%


Set reserve factor as 7.5%


Set TUSD with unlimited borrow cap.


updates the Compound price feed to peg TUSD to $1


Using JumpRateModelV2 as the interest rate model.

New TUSD market is also simulated for supply and borrow scenarios, with an account supplied COMP and borrowed TUSD from the cTUSD contract.
The testing includes:

COMP price (489655000) is successfully read from the new oracle contract when calculating the collateral value.
TUSD can’t be borrowed when its total asset value exceeds 60% of the COMP value. TUSD could be borrowed when the asset value is lower than the amount.
During the getAccountLiquidity function test, the value changed to liquidatable when the simulation time passed.

Since I think its important we keep the quality bar high for changes to the core protocol, I want to point out some things that I think could be improved here. Its not 100% clear to me what these functions are doing (the tx data is hardcoded everywhere), and I think its unnecessarily difficult to run/replicate these tests (due to the timing concerns).
I think the single-script simulations that we have many examples of at this point in the repository should really be the norm. My team at Compound will be focused on making this easier and lowering the bar on contributions here over the next few months.

Now that its been a few days after this forum post and this Compound Liquidity presentation during our community call, I think it is now more important than ever to establish priorities regarding compound’s role in bootstrapping liquidity for partner projects, its role in other projects, and compound’s “treasury”.
This includes


Who to fund/bootstrap


How to do it


Governance


Paying for it




Managing Risk


To start with the who question.
I will make two distinctions for this category. The first one being projects like pooltogether ,Fluidity, and Dharma, projects that are directly built on or incorporate the compound protocol into their own projects. These projects can be funded originally by compound grants and those who were are perfect for this category
The second will be projects that incorporate compound indirectly. Projects like MakerDao, which not only help users move assets into compound to generate yeild, but also allows COMP for onboarding and borrowing DAI.
Below are examples where MakerDao interacts with Compound

COMP onboarding for vaults-

DAI on Compound, 4 Billion Dollars of DAI are in compound, generating yield.

At this point in 2021, defi protocols work with and within each other, whether they like it or not. If MakerDao has a say in compound, seeing as their token generates yeild on top of COMP, then compound should act the same.
Now, How to do it and how to pay for it.

What proposal actions would need to occur? I believe the Timelock would need to ERC-20 approve COMP to cCOMP, etc.

@rleshner posted this in the forum a few weeks ago and we may have seen a glimpse of an answer in the call today from @jared
Please correct me where I am wrong.
It is not as straight forward as making the timelock _grantcomp, lend and then borrow.
Giving the timeclock from governor bravo the responsibility for opening a loan is beyond a reasonable expectation for a governance timelock to do, especially when we consider the other steps.
How will the timelock collect comp? How will the timelock act if there an issue with liquidation?
I don’t know the answers to this, but it takes a minimum of 4? days for governance to do things, without including the actual forum and governance process. It is simply out of reach for governance to maintain any kind of loan position like this, borrowing or lending.
What is not unrealistic (this means it is doable) is the sweep reserves function, called two times to pay @arr00 put along a governance proposal, and another realistic thing is to _grantcomp to a multisig like the CGC proposal did.
Realistically, our funding sources are the depreciated market reserves, which ought to be swept towards compound liquidity, as well as the comptroller contract.
Below are Funding Sources
SAI Reserves

Half A Million USD

15k USD

7 BTC
Compound: Comptroller | 0x3d9819210a31b4961b30ef54be2aed79b9c9cd3b

130M USD in comptroller

After the money is swept, now what?
I would love a multisig, just like CGC has, but with more community oversight. Today we had the privileges’ of hearing proposals for bootstrapping in our call, maybe after these calls, we can vote?
What does pooltogether think?

To clarify my proposal. Compound governance would maintain complete control of these funds and could unwind the position at anytime. I would advocate for a one year timeline as the assumed deposit length which could be unwind early or extended if desired.

If by compound governance you mean a multisig holding and controlling swept funds, yes. We need governance and their oversight to manage the postions, but what do comp holders get in return?

Although currently “sponsors” do not accrue POOL I do think that will change and Compound governance would accrue POOL. There has been a consensus in the PoolTogether community to start rewarding sponsors with POOL and although this hasn’t been implemented yet I expect it will be.

Perfect, COMP holders get exposure and diversification towards like minded projects, we get to help each other out and in return for using compounds liquidity and “equity”, comp holders will get POOL, or FLUID, or MKR, or whatever kind of situation we work out. However, there needs to be some kind of equity/governance compensation. Maybe down the line we will make a POOL market that will get comp speeds as well, as it all works out.
But risk needs to be managed, COMP cant just sit idle, I like the idea of onboarding some of the “treasury multisig” funds towards makerdao, to generate DAI, just to mitigate some “at home” risk.
These are all just ideas, keep them coming.

['Compound LitQuidity'],"Thanks for taking time to put a variety of thoughts together @massnomis.
A few points around mechanics:

If assets are held in the Timelock contract (of which Governor Bravo is the admin), then use of those funds requires COMP token-holder approval
If assets are held in a multi-sig wallet (e.g. the community multi-sig), use of those funds does not require COMP token-holder approval, and instead of based on a social contract, Snapshot voting, etc.
The Timelock by default acts as the Compound “treasury”; any reserves removed from a market first enter the Timelock
The Timelock contract can receive governance instructions from COMP-tokenholders, including to borrow assets, transfer them, etc; it can collect COMP on its own (although the claim function can be called by anybody to collect the Timelock’s COMP).

In regards to the PoolTogether proposal, without any code changes, token-holders could through a proposal:

Transfer a significant overcollateralization of COMP to the Timelock (such that it doesn’t face, in any short time-frame, reasonable liquidation risk)
Approve COMP to cCOMP; enable cCOMP (and cUNI?) as collateral; mint cCOMP; borrow USDC
Call the sponsor function of PoolTogether; end sponsorship if/when ready

This process would not change the dynamics of the community, proposal process, or entrust any individuals with funds or managing assets; the entire process would be subject to COMP token-holder governance.
If this process is successful, the community could expand liquidity operations in any number of ways; all of which will be fun to design and debate.",28,55.6,2021-05-05
['Compound LitQuidity'],"So I absolutely love the idea of sponsoring this pooltogether comp pool.
Regarding Governance,
I think the best way to go about this is by doing two separate proposals
The first should be a “test” transaction, the timelock sponsoring the pooltogether pool with 1 Dollar, in addition to sweeping reserves of depreciated assets. With the money lying around and the pooltogther contract tested and the community shown, then a second proposal should go through with actually doing the full amount (after community discussion).
Also, @rleshner, what are your thoughts on sweeping depreciated asset reserves.
The only problem i have with the above proposal is the question of equity. How can we in a trustless way “trade” our treasury investments for pool tokens?

I think the best way to go about this is by doing two separate proposals

Instead of doing two on-chain proposals, I think we can do a “fork test” where we fork mainnet exactly and test it out to make sure everything works smoothly. That will eliminate the need

The only problem i have with the above proposal is the question of equity. How can we in a trustless way “trade” our treasury investments for pool tokens?

After supplying my coins to compound as a lender/borrower, I managed to earn 0.3 compound coin.


I click on “collect” under Vote to collect those distributions.  Then in my wallet it pops up that this requires a fee of 0.1333 ether!


At current market of $570 per ether, this is ~$75, which is more than the cost of the compound distribution itself. I tried a couple more times, sometime i get a fee of 0.0344 ether instead which is still a lot at $17


I am looking for some tips how this works,  should I just not collect the compound distribution and wait until it reaches a much higher number then do it, to save on the ether fee?  It seems this high fee for collecting compound coin kind defeats the profitability of this whole enterprise.

['Supporting the Compound Ecosystem'],"Last week I wrote a post about an idea for Compound Governance to support the growth of the PoolTogether protocol. A strong consensus emerged against that specific implementation but many seemed supportive of the general principle of helping support PoolTogether and thereby also help the Compound protocol grow.
After talking to members of the community, I have a new proposal. This proposal achieves the same end goal of supporting growth in a way that doesn’t use a limited resource (COMP) and costs the Compound protocol much less.
The proposal is for the Compound protocol to “sponsor” the USDC prize savings pool on PoolTogether with $10 million of USDC.
“Sponsorship” is money deposited into PoolTogether savings pools that contributes interest to the savings prizes but is NOT eligible to win. This raises the expected value for all depositors and helps kick-start a reflexive growth loop for PoolTogether (larger prizes create more deposits, more deposits create larger prizes). It’s important to note the sponsorship can be removed at any time! So the value is not locked into PoolTogether. At the end of the day, all this capital is going into Compound so it’s good for Compound as well.
Execution
The actual proposal would do the following:

Send COMP from the Comptroller to the Timelock
Mint cCOMP with the COMP
Borrow $10 million USDC using cCOMP as collateral
Deposit USDC into sponsorship of USDC savings pool

Risks


The USDC deposited into the PoolTogether would be subject to the smart contract risk of the PoolTogether contracts. This risk is very low based on a few factors. 1) The PoolTogether smart contracts are non-upgradeable. 2) The USDC prize pool contract has been live on main net since January 11th 2021, securing over $80 million dollars with no exploits of any kind. Contracts using the same code but different asset types have been live for even longer. 3) the prize pool contract has been professionally audited by Consensus Diligence. 4) The prize pool has no external dependencies (no oracle risk). 5) The team has an excellent security track record and no smart contracts related to PoolTogether have ever been exploited.


The only additional risk is that the loan could be liquidated if COMP price majorly decreased. This risk can be well managed by ensuring the liquidation price is very low.


Benefits
Reiterating the introduction. This is a low cost and low risk way for the Compound protocol to incentive growth via integration partners. As a protocol, making sure strong third party interfaces exist is crucial to the long term health of the Compound ecosystem.",52,310.4,2021-04-29
['Supporting the Compound Ecosystem'],I would like to highlight that the $10 million USDC will be redeposited back into Compound. I think this is a good proposal.,49,9.8,2021-04-29
['Supporting the Compound Ecosystem'],"This is a creative approach to supporting PoolTogether, and could become a template for supporting other applications or use cases with liquidity. As an experiment for the Compound protocol & stake-holders, I’m a huge fan of this approach; it puts the protocol/treasury/community resources to work directly.
A few questions/considerations:

The “cost” of this proposal to COMP token-holders would include the USDC interest paid to the protocol; this isn’t free. For $10M, at a current interest rate of 4.6%, it would cost the protocol/token-holders 460k USDC/yr. Not that this is necessarily an issue, but should be paid attention to; the Timelock would have to repay additional USDC before being able to withdraw the COMP.
How would this impact the cCOMP market, or USDC market? Given the size, it’s not necessarily material, but should be paid attention to.
When would the sponsorship USDC be returned to the protocol? Does the Compound protocol receive POOL? How does Compound enter into an agreement with another protocol? Who administers this? Is there any recourse, if the USDC isn’t returned?
What proposal actions would need to occur? I believe the Timelock would need to ERC-20 approve COMP to cCOMP, etc.
What alternatives exist, from the Compound protocol’s perspective? Selling COMP for USDC, to sponsor PT? Withdrawing USDC reserves, to sponsor PT? Are these more attractive?

Bootstrapping partner liquidity is certainly an interesting experiment to explore. I’m a fan of trying something along these lines.",49,179.8,2021-04-29

Not that this is necessarily an issue, but should be paid attention to; the Timelock would have to repay additional USDC before being able to withdraw the COMP.

Yes, good to acknowledge this isn’t free. As @blck noted it would be somewhat offset by yield on COMP and also high probability it would be completely covered by accrued POOL (more on that later).

How would this impact the cCOMP market, or USDC market? Given the size, it’s not necessarily material, but should be paid attention to.

The thing to pay attention to here is the supply side on the COMP market. That is currently $411 million and to do this would likely want to supply around ~30 million to have a nice buffer. So that is a decent size. On the USDC market it will be immaterial

When would the sponsorship USDC be returned to the protocol? Does the Compound protocol receive POOL? How does Compound enter into an agreement with another protocol? Who administers this? Is there any recourse, if the USDC isn’t returned?

To clarify my proposal. Compound governance would maintain complete control of these funds and could unwind the position at anytime. I would advocate for a one year timeline as the assumed deposit length which could be unwind early or extended if desired.
Although currently “sponsors” do not accrue POOL I do think that will change and Compound governance would accrue POOL. There has been a consensus in the PoolTogether community to start rewarding sponsors with POOL and although this hasn’t been implemented yet I expect it will be.
I do not believe any type of agreement would be necessary between the protocols. We could do something but I think it would be unneeded overhead.
Finally, in terms recourse if USDC isn’t returned. PoolTogether governance would have no way to stop the funds from being withdrawn so this would only happen if PoolTogether protocol was hacked and the funds were stolen. If this were to happen Compound governance should assume there is no recourse to get funds back.

What alternatives exist, from the Compound protocol’s perspective? Selling COMP for USDC, to sponsor PT? Withdrawing USDC reserves, to sponsor PT? Are these more attractive?

Withdrawing USDC reserves or selling COMP to USDC would both be viable options. Personally I don’t think withdrawing USDC reserves is the best though. We should keep those in the protocol at least for now. Selling COMP to diversify might be the right option but is a very different discussion.
Overall, I would like to think about how we could get ~$250 million USDC “Compound Liquidity” fund and deploy it across multiple protocols building on Compound.",28,95.6,2021-05-01

Leighton Cusack - USDC Loan to PoolTogether (starts at 2:20)

Leighton presented a vision for “Compound Liquidity”, a program that provides long-term growth liquidity to the best projects built on top of the Compound protocol. The goals of the program are to help existing projects grow, incentivize new projects to integrate with Compound, and grow the Compound treasury through potential governance token rewards. As a pilot, Leighton proposes a $10m loan of USDC to a PoolTogether Prize Pool to boost the prize amount. Eventually, Leighton envisions a $100m fund that the protocol uses to help grow other projects in the ecosystem. You can view Leighton’s presentation on “Compound Liquidity” here.

Getty Hill / Johann Eid - ChainLink Oracle Development (starts at 15:45)

Getty and Johann provided an update on the Chainlink price feed development, which uses values within a 15% deviation of Uniswap prices. The Chainlink team has started testing the price feed on mainnet and has an audit with Trail of Bits scheduled on the 10th of May. Johann plans to publish a forum post tonight will more details on the testing results and next steps. You can read more about the proposed oracle design on the accompanying forum post.

Fluidity - Stablecoin Project Powered by Compound (starts at 23:01)

Shahmeer shared details on a new stablecoin called Fluidity that uses Compound in the backend to power rewards. Users deposit stablecoins onto Fluidity in exchange for “Fluid Dollars”. Fluidity supplies the stablecoins to Compound to earn yield, and creates prize pools with the yield similar to PoolTogether. The main innovation of the Fluidity system is that the prize pool is awarded to a winning transaction of Fluid Dollars, split between the sender and receiver. Rewarding transactions instead of addresses incentivizes the community to use Fluid Dollars for a variety of payments use cases. Shahmeer expects the smart contracts for Fluidity to be deployed in June, so stay tuned for any updates on the launch timing. You can view Fluidity’s presentation here.

Cyber - Compound APY Dashboard (starts at 31:50)

They are currently working on design and development of the dashboard, and plan to launch it in June. They also plan to publish a forum in the next couple weeks to gather feedback from the community on which data points would be most useful.

['Grant to PoolTogether for Launch of Tether Prize Saving Pool'],"PoolTogether is a protocol for no loss prize savings built on Compound. The protocol is one of the very first, largest, and longest running protocols to be built on top of Compound. PoolTogether was launched in June of 2019 and has been providing supply side capital and users to Compound continuously since then (at one point there were more unique depositors using Compound via PoolTogether than Compound directly). Currently PoolTogether supplies ~$220 million of supply side assets to Compound.
In addition, PoolTogether has been an exceptionally value positive actor in the Compound ecosystem. Since the COMP governance token launched PoolTogether has never sold any COMP. All COMP accrued has either been stored with PoolTogether governance or given away to depositors. PoolTogether has also not participated in any recursive yield farming activities with COMP. Meaning relative to other depositors with the same size of deposits, COMP accrued as been much less.
All this leads me to my ask 
PoolTogether has deployed a new prize savings pool for the Tether asset type. Because of the nature of the protocol, PoolTogether is uniquely reflexive in growth. Larger prizes lead to more deposits, more deposits create larger prizes. This creates a bootstrapping problem for new prize pools to attract large amounts of capital.
I’m asking for a 1,000 COMP grant to help bootstrap the Tether prize pool and ultimately bring more capital into the Compound protocol. At current market prices 1,000 COMP is $475,000. This COMP would not be sold but rather given out over the first 10 weeks of the new Tether prize pool as prizes. This means the Tether prize pool would be bootstrapped to an initial ~$47,500 weekly savings prize for the first 10 weeks. This would make the prize closer to the current Dai and USDC prize pools.
Ultimately this proposal is good for Compound as it will bring even more depositors and users to the protocol via a third party interface. It also shows Compound’s appreciation and valuing of its longest term integration partner. It’s good for PoolTogether has it bootstraps network effects needed to help more people save money.
That’s it! I’m open to any questions.
P.S.

PoolTogether can switch the yield source through governance so there’s not necessarily a long term value capture to Compound from a big USDT prize pool.
I think it could make more sense for Compound to use funds from the USDT reserves to sponsor the new pool for a certain period of time. This would create larger pool prizes, help incentivize deposits and the virtuous cycle of growing pool reserves, but at a much lower cost - Compound can retrieve the USDT in the future once the prize pool has grown sufficiently large.",51,195.2,2021-04-20

given the COMP maximum supply it is a zero sum game.

"[""Lego DAO -- promoting Compound's governance standards""]","Hey Compound community — I want to introduce you all to Lego DAO, an experienced new group working on DAOs / governance. We think there’s a lack of flexible, well-aligned governance frameworks that serve the current crypto / ownership economy space, so we’re taking a client-driven approach and connecting existing standards like Compound Governor and Gnosis Safe. We think this approach is kind of a no-brainer, but for various reasons, no one is actively promoting these standards — we want to do that.
We’re currently working on an MVP and should have work to share in the next month or so.
We think the Compound community might be interested in this for a few reasons:


Practical benefit: since we’re basing a large part of the MVP on the Compound governor contract, our project might lead to greater adoption of the governance contract and UI standards used by Compound. The more projects are using those standards, the more new tooling, research, and community practices will flow back to benefit the Compound community.

Investment: in the future, if the Lego DAO project does launch a governance token to help direct development, early funders will be included in the distribution, so if Compound gave a grant for some of this work in the future, it would receive some of those governance tokens.

Legacy: as we promote these standards, we’ll also be implicitly promoting Compound, i.e. free PR painting Compound as an important leader in the governance space. We’re in talks right now with projects lke Yearn, Gnosis, DXdao, Lido, Prime DAO, Orca Protocol and others: these are the kinds of folks we’d be promoting the standards to.

We’re building in public, so you can generally find up-to-date info in our notion:

Larry Sukernik - Grants Batch 2 Funded (starts at 2:36)

Larry provided an update on the Grants program, which recently funded its second batch of 6 projects for a total of $98k. A brief list of the funded projects and grant amounts is provided below.

Integrating Compound Grants with Boardroom ($7.5k)
Standalone Dashboard for Compound ($10k)
Building Flipside Crypto Dashboards for Compound ($25k)
Educational Content on Compound (in Japanese) ($15k)
Compound-ERC20-Migrator ($2.5k)
Integrating Fluidity with Compound ($37.5k)



Sam Simons - cCOMP Market Research (starts at 16:44)

Sam gave an overview of the cCOMP market research he’s been conducting as a part of a funded grants project. Sam compared the market dynamics for COMP across various protocols, including Compound, Venus, and CREAM to understand how the asset is being used and traded. One of the major goals of the research is to determine if a borrow cap for COMP on Compound is necessary, in order to prevent voting manipulation. You can view a Dune dashboard that Sam created to analyze COMP, and stay tuned for a more formal write-up on the forums.

Johann Eid - Chainlink Oracle Solution (starts at 28:15)

Johann shared more context around the proposed Chainlink oracle solution, which has been discussed at length in the forums. Johann explained that the proposed solution consists of premium data providers like CoinGecko, Brave New Coin, CryptoCompare who aggregate prices across multiple sources, and a Uniswap anchor to validate that prices are within a 15% deviation range of the Chainlink price. Governance would also have the ability to switch from the Chainlink price to the Uniswap TWAP price if the system encountered any issues. The development work for this solution is almost completed, and Johann expects that the audit from Trail of Bits will ready in the next week or so.

TylerEther - LINK Listing Proposal (starts at 42:20)

TylerEther shared an update on the efforts to add LINK as the next supported market on Compound. Tyler proposes that the market be initially deployed with the conservative parameters of 0% collateral factor, 25% reserve factor, and 0.0014625 COMP speed (same as BAT, UNI, and ZRX). Tyler plans to submit a governance proposal for the LINK listing in the coming days, so keep an eye out for the proposal.

Kevin Nielsen - Boardroom Integration with Compound Grants (starts at 46:10)

Kevin shared a demo of Boardroom’s integration with the Compound Grants Program. The integrated dashboard has a brainstorming section for community members to organize ideas, a voting section that allows COMP holders to signal their support for various proposals, a finance section that shows awarded grant projects, and a calendar that will show upcoming community events. The Boardroom team is looking for feedback from the broader community on which features would be valuable on the dashboard, so reach out to Kevin with any ideas.

['cCOMP Market Report ++'],"Greetings.
Its been a few months since I have last spoken about cCOMP and the oddities that the market contains.
While originally I came into this topic hoping to make some quick and sharp changes regarding either the interest rate parameters, borrow cap, or even the cfactor. But as it usually is, hastily made decisions don’t always hold the most predictable consequences.
This journey led me to learn about what it really means to be your own bank, the difference between stealing and being educated, and how to use SQL.
I want to thank the grants committee for helping me out financially and giving me the resources and the assistance I needed along the way.
So what does being your own bank mean?
I think this idea came from bitcoin, where individuals would instead manage their own accounts on a distributed ledger, instead of on a bank’s internal ledger, or even on the central banks ledger.
Sure, that’s not all a bank does, but that’s all bitcoin could do at the time
That idea was enough for many at the time, because that’s all that the decentralized financial world could offer at the time, a ledger. But the year is 2021, not 2009 and the financial resources have vastly expanded on decentralized computing systems
Now that we have Compound Finance, other “self driving banks”, derivatives and liquid automated markets, the idea of being your own can be one of two options.
Stay the same, (Stacking Sats)
or…
Everyone can individually learn how to act like a financial institution, balancing assets, liabilities, equity, derivatives and liquidity requirements.
Ok, so the first option is too simple. (Some people like alt coins, are degens, spend hours of their days away from loved ones to read “charts” and draw lines with crayons on their computer screens). If you are here on this forum, you have at least understood the idea of the time value of money, the importance of generating yields, cash flow, and maybe a bit more.
So how do you be your own bank using defi?
What does a bank even do?


Borrow Low, Lend high


Reduce their risk (optional)


What does a banks balance sheet look like?
Assets = Liability + Equity
Here is an example of a sample bank’s balance sheet.

image1024×768 83.3 KB

Some of these terms are fairly interchangeable within the defi space


Borrowings (DAI)


Lending (ctokens)


equity (COMP?)


Some are less interchangeable


An individual using compound is not going to have their Assets = Liabilitys, because of the cFactors


(even with a high cFactor (.75) the balance sheet will not be balanced)


Reserves (Compound has reserves, and COMP holders/governance can sweep reserves, but it is not the same)


Lets say you wanted to comp farm/recursively lend.
What would your balance sheet look like?
Lets say you have 100 USDC (cfactor 0.75) (borrowing DAI/USDC)
…

Blue: Lending Position (Total)
Gray: Lending Position from Recursive Borrows
Orange: Debt
Confusing Right? Being a bank is difficult. Here is a “simple” ETH recursive lending situation, only borrowing and lending ETH. See how our COMP returns are higher because of our enlarged position?

Deleveraged APY

The interesting thing to note is that the higher your borrow rate is, the higher your debt will become, collecting even more COMP.
Before the first COMP speed patch, comp returns would be highest wherever the borrow APY is highest, and to some extent (keeping market comp speeds constant) that would be the same as it is today.
Now that we have some of this out of the way, now we can move on to the cComp market and actually view it from the BYOB perspective
Below is a graph of ccomp utilization (borrows/supplied)
This determines the interest rate.

But why is the UTIL constantly going down?
What are those bumps?
Glad you asked:
UTIL is going down because there is a borrow cap (Currently ~92k COMP) and the multisig controlling the caps feels like raising it would be overstepping their duties.
The bumps are 1 of two things


Repayments of debt


change in borrow cap and immediate borrow

At the end of the day, not only does “locking” in this position generate a lot of comp as “income”, but their position size for COMP is essentially tripled. So if comp goes up in price, as it has in the past their exposure is high and risk is low.
Obviously these individuals/organizations have a great understanding of how COMP speeds work and possibly knew about the borrow cap (Although none are on the multisig - so no conflict of interest)
But the real advantages they had were their understandings of leverage, the power of recursive lending and the idea of a carry trade.
The idea of being your own bank brings a lot of power and a lot of responsibility, but because these tools are available for all of us within the DeFi world, we should all try to learn from the banks, in order to mimic them and become even more profitable.
Below are the “balance sheets” of seven of the larger whales in compound.
Take a look at how they balance their assets and liabilities, making sure both are profitable.

Blockchain and Real Estate, a new look at an old investment. | Grants

I have recently started working on a large side project, right below you. I am...

['COMP staking Collateralization'],"I’ve been thinking about a method for COMP staking for a while now and have drafted up a possible implementation, but there are many design decisions that need to be made before a concrete path can be chosen. I am at a point where I need to decide if staked COMP should be usable as collateral.
A COMP staking system will be a method for distributing fees and possibly COMP to users who have a staked interest in the success of the protocol. Staked COMP will be staked for a chosen timeframe and earn “dividends” during this time. Users maintain full delegation rights of their COMP. The idea is somewhat modeled after vCRV.
We as a community need to decide if this staked COMP should have a collateral factor. The type of implementation hinges on this decision, and I can’t go forward with the project until a decision is made. We as a community should discuss this and decide how we would like to move forward.",56,1551.2,2021-03-19
['COMP staking Collateralization'],"I say no collateralization of COMP while staking.  If you want to collateralize COMP, as a holder, use the protocol.  If you want to be able to earn on your COMP, while maintaining your right to vote, stake it.
Why not just set a % on how much COMP is earned through staking and then have the emissions decline after “x” timeframe.  COMP emissions should also be reduced from user’s use of the protocol.  More emissions are needed at the beginning of a cryptocurrency.  Every cryptocurrency project that has succeeded have lowered emissions in some sort of fashion along the way.",57,41.2,2021-03-19
['COMP staking Collateralization'],"I believe that we always should aim for the maximum utility when introducing new features. Staking by itself not really creates that much value. Basically it’s just promise not to sell for a certain time at the core. That could be rewarded, sure, like 5% APY or something like that might sound reasonable. But if someone thinks that timelocking tokens should be massively rewarded he should come down to earth. Vast majority of COMP tokens already is vested or in treasury, small amount of free floating tokens isn’t really a big deal, so holding or selling for that portion of tokens is quite irrelevant in big picture.
However, if staked COMP is usable as collateral, that is quite a product offering which simply doesn’t exist currently. And i’m not talking about dust holders like single or double digit COMP holders, who while obviously would benefit from that as well, but since usd value is relatively small, not that much. But for holders who have 4 digit and above it’s a solid proposal: lock your COMP for a certain period, have your voting rights intact, use it as collateral to put your money to work. Basically contract risk aside, you have the only risk that in case of becoming undercollateralised some or all your COMP could be liquidated. There’s no liquidity risk or anything else associated with borrowing.
Frankly speaking its actually a better deal for VC than vesting. Like much better. Should be there from beginning, but late better than never.
As for rewards it’s not even necessary for such solution, certanly you can fairly easy earn with borrowed money. (which would actually benefit both protocol and wider ecosystem of defi more) I’d say weighted voting power would be a better reward. Depending on a duration of “stake”, voting power could count as 1 for two votes or whatever multiplication is appropriate.
I’d say while we could leave staking rewards as possible opportunity, it certanly could be better spend in other way. For example, COMP rewards could be distributed for liquidity providers in COMP/ETH markets or other pairs on important DEXes. It actually doesn’t even need to be developed in-house, there easily could be collaboration with like sushiswap to distribute COMP rewards on their platform.",54,45.6,2021-03-20

 Sirokko:

But if someone thinks that timelocking tokens should be massively rewarded he should come down to earth


What is point of timelock?
In my opinion it would serve as a prevention of dumping (because centralize holder structure) or slowing down token velocity, maybe.
I agree with you that higher rate for longer timelock lead to more centralized protocol structure.



 arr00:

We as a community need to decide if this staked COMP should have a collateral factor


My opinion is that staked COMP should have a collateral factor. The reason for this is that Comp will have a value in the staking pool, and if that value will be further used to protect user resources on the protocol (in the event of a black swan or oracle error) - I see it as an additional utility.
By additional utility I mean “defensive collateral” and not “collateral for further leverage”. Is it possible to separate these two concepts in practice?
What are the possible side effects in case a staked COMP token is used as collateral?",50,29.8,2021-03-20
['COMP staking Collateralization'],"I don’t know if this would classify as staking but I think a great intermediary step would be to get a way for COMP holders to post COMP as collateral and be able to participate in governance. I know a number of very large COMP holders that would be interested in voting but the benefits of using it as collateral are more valuable for them.
I need to do some research in Governor Bravo bc idk what is and isn’t possible. Very rough idea would be to follow the ctoken schematic but strip out the borrow ability and add another token to voting like gCOMP that you receive when you deposit COMP.",44,128.8,2021-03-23
['COMP staking Collateralization'],I agree with the general sentiment here that COMP should be allowed to be used as collateral while being staked and serve in governance. Stripping away features should only be the case if theres a security concern.,30,21.0,2021-04-20
['COMP staking Collateralization'],"The additional point I’d like to bring up is that aside from (collateralization for) lending, it might be good to consider mechanisms for boosting liquidity in assets for Compound’s money markets as a means of stabilising the system. This would mean creating pools of liquidity to participate in market-making and ensuring an additional form of dividends + a different route towards incentive alignment. I’m generally in favour of enabling a form of a backstop (as seen in traditional banking equity tier guidelines) as a way to start providing a means of additional utility/alignment to long-term holders.
On this thread, it’d be good to understand where the fees to staked COMP holders will accrue from - and if this is intended to be a backstop for covering deficits in money markets. Also wonder what the community might think to imposing additional coverage fees on existing money markets that could be covered by staked COMP.
A sidenote: It might be a good time to start thinking about associating some form of additional control over the protocol reserves’ allocation (maybe in the form of using a portion of reserves towards optimising yields - through allocation to existing AMM’s to deepen liquidity for these assets and earn yield + potential BAL rewards). Would be helpful to take a leaf out of Aave’s safety module construction and enable the creation of deeper markets for COMP as well as the assets that Compound supports + align incentives from a financial standpoint as well.",25,50.0,2021-04-23
['Exchange Locking up COMP '],"Bought COMP on YoBit exchange ages ago, along with many others.

For example: user had 1 eth, he suplied it to Compound and now have let’s say 50 cEth. Now if user sell 50 cEth, he will have 0 Eth in Compound also, it will be gone together with cEth, and buyer will be able to redeem it from Compound for 1 Eth + interest accrued.

['Weighted Algorithmic Compound Distribution'],"
Problem
Currently, all markets have their own COMP distribution rates set through governance. The following is under the assumption that we want a fixed total COMP distribution rate over all markets.
When we add or remove markets, the COMP distribution rates for all other markets have to be adjusted to achieve our desired total COMP distribution. This can be quite cumbersome.

Solution
Assign every cToken a COMP distribution weight and introduce global COMP distribution rate targets for both lending and borrowing. These weights then calculate the distribution rate for each market.

Example
3 markets are supported: COMP, WBTC, and USDT. Global COMP distribution is 1 COMP per block for borrowing.




Market
Weight
Distribution Rate (Borrowing)




COMP
20
~0.57


WBTC
5
~0.14


USDT
10
~0.29




Formula
borrow_distribution_rate(MARKET) = global_borrow_distribution_rate * (weight(MARKET) / sum(weight(ALL_MARKETS))
supply_distribution_rate(MARKET) = global_supply_distribution_rate * (weight(MARKET) / sum(weight(ALL_MARKETS))

Benefits

Changing global distribution rates is simpler
Simpler distribution rate changes when adding or removing markets
Less room for human error when recalculating weights for all markets


Thoughts?",41,78.0,2021-04-10
['Weighted Algorithmic Compound Distribution'],"Maybe in the next comptroller implementation we could use COMP speed weights like you described instead of raw comp rate. New implementation might also give a chance to separate COMP borrow distribution from the supply rates (currently they’re 50/50 with no parameter to change it).
One problem is that the comptroller smart contract size is near the maximum size for ethereum. Much change might require creative ways to reduce comptroller size or separate the functionality into multiple contracts.",38,7.4,2021-04-10
['Weighted Algorithmic Compound Distribution'],"I’ve completed the code changes to implement this idea.
https://github.com/TRiLeZ/compound-protocol/tree/weighted-comp-speed
Changes:

Add separate borrow and supply distribution rates
Add weights for every market for both supply and borrow sides

['Weighted Algorithmic Compound Distribution'],"@TylerEther thanks for getting creative with this! It’s awesome to see you diving into the Comptroller contract.
The biggest issue that I see, is that the goal isn’t to divide the COMP distribution between a global “supply” side and a “borrow” side, but rather the supply or borrow side of an individual asset. For example, collateral assets (like ETH, WBTC) might see the COMP distribution allocated entirely to suppliers, while stablecoins (popular borrowing assets) might see the COMP distribution allocated more heavily to borrowers.
To the other aspect, having a “weight” by market, is a nice simplification – though it reintroduces the refreshcompspeeds function, which was removed in the last upgrade.",25,55.0,2021-04-13

Wednesday, April 7, 2021
Larry Sukernik - Grants Batch 1 Funded (starts at 1:32)

Larry provided an update on the Grants program, which has received 30 applications and funded its first batch of 7 projects. Based on the applications that the grant committee has reviewed, Larry shared feedback that applicants should try to be as specific as possible about what they’re trying to build, how it will benefit the Compound ecosystem, and the various milestones to get to the end goal. Larry also shared information on the dashboard contest that the Grants Program launched alongside Our Network, where users can submit data points about Compound on platforms like Dune Analytics or Flipside Crypto. The Grants team has received 16 submissions and will be announcing the winners shortly. Lastly, Larry shared that the Compound Grants Committee will be sponsoring the Scaling Ethereum Hackathon, which runs from April 16th to May 13th.

Arr00 - Governor Bravo & COMP Staking Development (starts at 9:00)

Arr00 shared an idea for a COMP staking mechanism that would reward users for participating in Compound governance. One potential implementation could be a new rewards contract that looks at whether a user (or that user’s delegate) has been active enough in governance to receive rewards in the form of additional COMP. Arr00 is looking for the community’s feedback on the overall design of the mechanism before he builds it. You can read more about COMP staking on Arr00’s original forum post, and post your own ideas/feedback.

Ruitao Su - Gateway Integration with Polkadot (starts at 16:20)

Ruitao provided an update on Acala’s Gateway integration with Polkadot, which recently received a grant from the grants program. Ruitao explained that their team is planning to build a starport on Acala, which is a parachain on Polkadot, in order to upload DOT to Gateway and download CASH to Acala. The starport pallet that the Acala team is building can also be redeployed by other parachain and substrate-based projects. The Acala team broke down the development project into 4 milestones, which are (1) Develop Acala Starport pallet, (2) Develop Offchain Worker & Message Passing, (3) Integration & Oracle, and (4) integrating Compound Cash into Acala Dapps. Ruitao predicts that by milestone #3, users will be able to interact with the starport on the Gateway testnet.

Leeland Lee - Meme Contest & Governance Tool (starts at 24:50)

Leeland shared information about the Meme Contest that Compound Grants is sponsoring alongside Uniswap Grants. The competition will run for 4 weeks and feature a new theme each week that contestants can create memes about. The themes will be basic DeFi concepts like liqudations, impermanent loss, etc. to help convey this information to a broader audience. Leeland also discussed a governance tool he is working on to help connect voting decisions to voting reasons that are usually shared on Twitter.

Jared Flatow - Gateway Development Update (starts at 29:45)

Jared provided an update on the development of the Gateway testnet. The team is currently working on the m9 release, which will be the last planned change to the runtime. The main challenge will be reworking the event ingression to be able to handle reorgs on probabilistic finality chains. The team will submit their proposed runtime solution to OpenZepellin for an audit in roughly a couple of weeks, and plans to have an audit on the entire system in May or June. In parallel to this, the team is also working improving the API and block explorer, spam & DOS prevention, and overall stability of the network.

Arr00는 Compound 거버넌스에 참여한 사용자에게 보상을 제공할 수 있는 COMP 스테이킹 매커니즘과 관련된 아이디어에 대해 설명했습니다. 검토 중인 구현 방식 중 하나는 사용자(또는 사용자가 COMP를 위임한 대리인)가 거버넌스에서 열심히 활동하고 있는지 확인해서 COMP 보상을 제공하는 새로운 보상 contract를 만드는 것입니다. Arr00는 이 아이디어를 코드로 구현하기 전에 전반적인 메카니즘 설계에 대한 커뮤니티 피드백을 받고 있습니다. COMP 스테이킹 관련 포스팅은 거버넌스 포럼 게시글에서 확인하실 수 있으며 다양한 의견을 남겨주시길 부탁드립니다.

Ruitao Su - 폴카닷에 Gateway 통합하기 (음성 파일 시작 시간 16:20)

Ruitao는 Acala이 추진 중인 폴카닷에 Gateway를 통합하는 작업에 대한 진행 상황을 공유했습니다. 이 프로젝트는 Compound 보조금 지원 대상 중 하나로 선정되기도 했습니다. Acala 팀에서는 DOT를 Gateway로 업로드하고 Acala로 CASH를 다운로드하기 위해 Polkadot의 parachain인 Acala에 starport를 구축할 예정이라고 합니다. Acala 팀이 구축하고 있는 starport pallet은 다른 parachain이나 substrate 기반 프로젝트에 재배포할 수 있을 것입니다. Acala 팀은 4개의 마일즈 스톤을 설정했습니다: (1) Acala Starport pallet 개발 (2) 오프체인 Worker & 메시지 전달 기능 개발, (3) 통합 & 오라클, (4) Acala Dapps에 Compound Cash 통합. Ruitao는 3번째 마일즈스톤을 달성하는 시점이 되면 사용자가 Gateway 테스트넷 상에서 starport를 이용할 수 있을 것으로 예상했습니다.

Compound Developer Community Call Notes
Wednesday, March 24, 2021
John Morrow - Gauntlet Vesting Proposal Update (starts at 2:00)

John provided an update on the COMP vesting proposal, which should have a finalized audit from Quantstamp in the next few days. The next steps after the audit are unclear, as the vesting implementation would change the UX of integrated applications quite a bit and increase gas costs for interacting with the protocol. Since gas costs are even higher than when Gauntlet initially proposed vesting, the team plans to table vesting for the time being and work with the community to decide how and when to move forward with these changes. John will post the audit report once it becomes available, so stay tuned for further updates from the Gauntlet team.

Dennison Bertram - Gas Refunding Contract (starts at 6:15)

Dennison shared details of a gas refunding contract that aims to reduce friction points around gas heavy transactions in the governance system, in order to make governance more self-sufficient. The contract can be used to pay for administrative actions in Governor Alpha, like poking the contract for queuing, executing, or canceling proposals. Any protocol using this system could enter a target contract address, function signature, and max gas reimbursement to deploy the contract, and users who call the function can be refunded for their work. Dennison also notes that it is important to have the reimbursement slightly less than 100% to avoid miners from front running the transactions. Dennison will post more details on the proposed refunder contract next week, so stay tuned for updates.

Kuan - Compound Analytics on Scout (starts at 21:15)

Kuan shared a demo of Scout, which has detailed analytics on DeFi protocols like Compound. Rather than using SQL queries, Scout takes data from the Ethereum blockchain and synchronizes it to a MongoDB database. Users can analyze the protocol without writing any code and don’t need an account to view the public dashboards. Kuan is looking for community feedback on the various charts and metrics for the Compound dashboard, so reach out to him on Discord with any suggestions.

Leighton Cusack - Compound Prize Pool Builder (starts at 26:40)

Leighton shared information on PoolTogether’s new Prize Pool Builder, which allows users to easily construct their own prize pools without writing code. Users simply select parameters like yield source, deposit token, number of winners, and duration, and the builder automatically generates the code and provides an open-source interface. The prize pool contract that stores all the deposits has been audited by Open Zeppelin and Consensys, and is not upgradable to enhance security. The prize strategy contract defines how the accrued interest is distributed and allows for maximum flexibility on the type of prize pools that can be created. Developers should consider leveraging this tool from PoolTogether to build innovative new distribution mechanisms on top of the Compound protocol.

Adam Bavosa - Gateway Update (starts at 31:40)

Adam provided an update on the progress of Gateway, which has progressed from release m4 to m8 over the past 2 weeks. The major changes in these releases are an upgrade to the way that interest is calculated, safety suggestions implemented from the Open Zeppelin audit, and the ability to add additional validators through the governor contract on Ropsten. A full list of upgrades can be found on the Github releases page. There are currently have 6 validators on the Gateway testnet, 3 of which are the staking firms Stakefish, P2P Validator, and PureStake. The Compound Labs team is looking for validators that run perpetually without downtime, and have the bandwidth to participate in various testing scenarios.

['Governor Bravo Proposal'],"Delegate to the Governor Bravo CAP here: 0xd122638eCa5bB644591fE660FCe0B85E2aB6186a
Introduction
Governor Bravo has been a community effort for the past few months to bring governance to the next stage. This proposal transfers Compound governance to the new Governor Bravo contract. This transfer is done by setting the pending admin of the Timelock to Governor Bravo, then calling initiate on Governor Bravo, which accepts the Timelock admin. If this proposal is successful, all future Compound governance calls should be sent to Governor Bravo.
Proposal Calls
The first two calls reimburses Compound Labs $27k that was paid to Open Zeppelin for the audit from cUSDC reserves. The following two calls award bounties to Arr00(160 COMP) and Blurr(80 COMP) for organizing and executing the Governor Bravo project. The following call sets Governor Bravo as the pending admin, and the last call initiates Governor Bravo, accepting the Timelock admin.
Governor Bravo Details:
Governor Bravo has been developed by members of the community in the open for the past few months. The new contracts have been fully audited by Open Zeppelin, are fully covered by extensive test suites, have been simulated by forking simulations, and have been running on the kovan testnet.
The new features are as follows:

Upgradable implementation
Settable parameters (proposal threshold, voting period, voting delay)
Abstain vote option
Optional string voting reason
Proposer can always cancel their proposal (until execution)
Removal of the guardian
Continuous proposal id logic

The introduction of Governor Bravo allows for governance to create meta proposals to optimize the process and move the governing process forwards. The code changes of Governor Bravo are deliberately minimized but allow for endless exploration of governance modification in the future.
For more context, please see the Governor Bravo forum post Governor Bravo Development.
Important Notes:
Once the Governor Bravo proposal is live, no other proposals should be posted on Governor Alpha unless Governor Bravo fails. The Governor Bravo proposal will transfer the Timelock admin away from Governor Alpha which disallows future queuing and executing from Governor Alpha.
For platforms building on Compound Governance, note the Governor Bravo address and the ABI which can be found here. The first proposal on Governor Bravo will be one greater than this proposal. Any third party voting service should note the change of the support variable type from a boolean to a uint8. The support values are as follows: 0 = against, 1 = for, 2 = abstain.
NFT:
I plan to have a limited Compound NFT ready for the Governor Bravo initiation. The complete terms of who will be able to claim it are not concrete, but assume that only voters prior to this proposal will receive the NFT. It will probably be claimable through a merkle proof based distribution minting system. Claiming will be limited to ~2 days after Governor Bravo initiation, so be sure to check back here around Bravo initiation (the execution of this proposal) for claiming instructions.",76,2370.2,2021-03-15

"[""Proposal: Appoint stakefish as one of Compound Chain's validators""]","Hi! We wanted to officially introduce ourselves to the Compound community forum. As stated on compound.cash, validators will be appointed by COMP token holders, meaning the security of the Compound Chain will be in their hands. While the network is not live yet, we think it’s important to provide ample time for stakeholders to closely evaluate each validator candidate.
Project name: stakefish
Project location: Global team covering 13 different time zones (legal presence in Malta)
Project inception year: 2018
Team size: 29
Website: https://stake.fish/ (available in 16 different languages)
Social media:

Twitter: https://twitter.com/stakefish

Telegram: Telegram: Contact @stakefish

Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZvT8cGpFjnZUB9V-WzxPHg

Medium: stakefish – Medium


Networks supported: Ethereum 2.0, Chainlink, The Graph, Polkadot, Kusama, Edgeware, Centrifuge, Cosmos, Tezos, Solana, Flow, NEAR (for the full list, please visit stake.fish)
Total assets staked: Over $1 billion staked across networks
Motivation:
Our goal is to build a resilient infrastructure layer for blockchain projects of the future. With this goal in mind, we have been supporting critical Proof of Stake protocols and middleware projects from 2018 when many were in bootstrapping phases. We believe Compound Chain holds promise to become the backbone of value transfer and liquidity across multiple networks. We want to help Compound reach this vision by helping harden its core protocol.
Security setup:
We make use of multiple cloud providers across different regions. We take multiple factors into account when deciding the providers and regions, including connectivity with the rest of the network and assisting in decentralizing the validating infrastructure across the entire network.
We have 24/7 monitoring across all layers of our infrastructure. We have alerts set up for various metrics when thresholds are triggered. We also have an incident response plan, and disaster recovery plan to handle any emergency scenarios, such as chain halts and emergency upgrades.
Contributions to the ecosystem:

Promoting decentralization and open source

Ethereum 2.0 decentralization transparency initiative
Eth2 Batch Deposit contract
Deposit verification contract


Community building

Sponsoring and hosting events (example 1, example 2)
Powering memes (Optimism eye mask)
Powering grants (grant.fish)


Education

How to stake videos (example 1, example 2)
Blog posts on new concepts (Ethereum 2.0, Optimism)



Other considerations:

We have never been slashed and have built a great reputation amongst the validator community.
We have presence in most major Proof of Stake protocols. Supporting new Starports would be a trivial task for us.
We have been on Compound Chain’s testnet from early on. We have been onboarded as one of the first external validators on the testnet.
We have long experience running validators for Substrate based chains like Edgeware and Centrifuge.

Next steps:
We will work closely with the Compound team to ensure Compound Chain is battle tested. Once launch is in sight, we’ll create an on-chain proposal for voting. We are happy to answer any questions and let us know if there are any additional topics that should be addressed in this post!",33,381.6,2021-03-25
['Facilitate Trading Using Pooled Assets'],"The Pooled Assets
The Compound protocol has become one of the largest DeFi projects to date. With over $12 billion worth of assets supplied, earning interest, and $5.5 billion worth of borrowed assets. The gap in supply to borrow could be put to use much like an AMM, however, Compound already utilizes price feeds for each asset. With utilizing price feeds Compound could 1-up other trading protocols which use pooled assets and rely on a specific balance between the tokens/assets in every market pair.
Price Feeds are better than AMMs
Using price feeds would allow any asset on Compound to be traded with any other asset. Someone wanting to trade UNI for USDC could visit Compound and do just that. However, the real use-case scenario comes into play with borrowers. If a user borrows ETH (maybe to stake it on the beacon chain) but no longer has ETH to repay the debt to avoid liquidation they would have to trade another asset to obtain the ETH to repay. Multiple reasons make this not pleasant, gas fees skyrocketing comes to mind in Ethereum’s current state.
How can Compound facilitate trading with supplied assets?
When a user supplies an asset, the user’s ETH address gets credited with cTokens. When the user wants to redeem that asset, their address gets debited cTokens and the asset returns, plus interest earned. Some of the supplied assets on Compound are borrowed which makes the lending market work much like a bank, but decentralized.
Currently, each asset borrowed must be repaid with the same asset. My idea is to allow borrowers to repay their debt with an alternative asset. To do this they should still have to go to the borrow side and select repay for the asset they borrowed.  Then when the UI shows the pop-up with the asset to repay on the top, this could be changed to a dropdown menu and say “repay with:” so that users can select another asset to repay the debt.  When filling out the amount, the UI should display to the user an estimate of how much of the debt, calculated in the borrowed asset, will be paid.  Then just confirm the transaction and that is the only change on the UI needed.
Now, on the backend, it currently couldn’t work.  This is the difficult part.
Scenario: When a borrower repays their ETH debt with UNI.
After the borrower confirms that transaction, the UNI will go into a side pool contract (not yet be used for supply) as well as the amount of cUNI needed to be minted as if the UNI were actually supplied.  The amount of ETH would also be removed from the borrow side, since the user was repaying their ETH debt.  ETH would go into the side pool contract as well.
The side pool contract will end up holding both cTokens and assets.  In this scenario, it would contain ETH, UNI and cUNI.  The next Compound user to borrow UNI and/or ETH will obtain a portion of their funds from the side pool contract.  Same with the next user to supply UNI, a portion of the cUNI tokens will come from the side pool contract.
Possible issues to solve
Now, the biggest issue I can see is a user repaying a ‘mega-debt’, which could easily be remedied by setting maximum limits that depend on market conditions.
Minting cTokens, I am not so sure about.
Since the user is saving on Ethereum gas fees, Compound could charge a small % of the trade to be paid in COMP.  This would give COMP more utility.  The fees could go anywhere really, but I was thinking that they could get recycled and added to the next COMP distribution on a subsequent block.
…
Well, that’s all I have so far.
Yay, nay or feedback?
",29,60.6,2021-03-24
['CP039: Avoiding liquidations'],"One thing that all participants in the recent vote seem to agree on is that changes should try to avoid increasing the quantity of liquidations users face. As users of Compound only provide one piece of identifying information - their address - it’s not clear how to contact them to make sure they are aware of these changes. I’d like to suggest a few things that we could to minimize liquidations and wanted to get feedback on these ideas.


Try to contact the users using ETH transactions. The idea here is to:

Send a small, but strange amount of eth, e.g. .0001234 or .000420420
Encode a message into the Hex data field that says something like “Check your WBTC borrow on COMP”



This is not a great option for obvious reasons - the user has to see the transaction and also try to parse the Hex Data. However, we’re prepared to “message” as many addresses that are at risk as time and money allows.


Update the Compound UI to notify users of the pending parameter change

One thing that we can’t do as a community is to prevent people from opening new WBTC positions that are high risk. Maybe the Compound labs team could push a quick update to the site to warn new users of this change, you could imagine a small toast that users would see until Sunday



@getty and other community members have repeatedly espoused the virtues of WBTC borrowers - that they are sophisticated and that they manage their positions actively. I hope this is true. But we are prepared to do everything we can to try to prevent liquidations in the case this hope is even partially misplaced. No one has been liquidated yet, and I’m optimistic that the community can rally together to minimize the impact of these important changes to the protocol.",69,178.8,2021-03-05

I could see these types of notifications going unnoticed most of the time.
What I think would really help when it comes to liquidations are three things:

Partial liquidations. When the liquidation threshold is hit, liquidate just enough of the collateral assets to hit an X% borrowing rate.
Time delays. Wait X amount of time after passing the liquidation threshold before liquidating. This gives users more time to manage their loans in the case of a sudden/unexpected market drop.
Liquidation preferences. Where I can select the order of my collateral assets to be sold off in the event of a (partial) liquidation.

['ALPHA Listing Proposal '],"Hi Compound community! I’m Amp Burapachaisri from Alpha Finance Lab and this is my proposal for adding ALPHA as an asset to lend and borrow on Compound.
Overview
Alpha Finance Lab is focused on building an ecosystem of innovative DeFi products that will interoperate to maximize returns while minimizing risks for users. Alpha products focus on capturing unaddressed demand in DeFi in an innovative and user-friendly way.
Key Facts

ALPHA is a governance token for Alpha Finance Lab ecosystem and portfolio of products - token holders can vote on the opened proposals for key product metrics.
The first product from the portfolio is Alpha Homora, the first leveraged yield farming product in DeFi. It captured $1 billion of TVL within 4 months since its launch in October 2020, bringing Alpha Homora to top 15 of DeFi Pulse (at the time of writing #12).
Upcoming products include AlphaX, a decentralized, non-orderbook perpetual trading platform with tokenized positions and funding rate baked into the price of the asset, and more Alpha products in the making.

Alpha Finance CEO, Tascha Punyaneramitdee, has an extensive worldwide banking background with a vision to reform traditional finance in a decentralized manner. She was also former Head of Strategy at Band Protocol. Building with Tascha is Alpha’s lead engineer, Nipun Pitimanaaree, an MIT graduate with degrees in mathematics and computer science, and 4x International Mathematical Olympiad gold medalist. Prior to Alpha, Nipun worked as Chief Technology Officer at a major robotics company.
Motivation & Benefits
Currently, ALPHA is only listed on CREAM, yet its liquidity pools with ETH tend to be highlighted as trending on many AMMs. With its outstanding achievements, Alpha attracted the attention of the whole DeFi space including the recent announcement of Delphi Digital’s investment in the project. Other notable investors include The Spartan Group, Multicoin Capital, and DeFiance Capital.
Benefits for Compound

Increased TVL for Compound: Listing the ALPHA token would bring a flow of TVL in form of Alpha tokens as collateral to borrow against it (current market cap according to CoinGecko at time of writing is $444m)
Increased brand-awareness: Listing Alpha as collateral would cause a stream of marketing activities that will bring new users to Compound. Alpha Finance Lab’s community includes 4100 members of Telegram Group, 5900 members on Discord, 42k Twitter followers.
Access to Alpha token holders: 8400 holders + over 20k users participated in the Binance Launchpad

Token

Symbol: ALPHA
Blockchain Type: ERC20, BEP20
Role of Token: Utility

Exchanges

ALPHA is listed on a number of popular exchanges (Alpha Finance price, ALPHA price index, chart, and info | CoinGecko) including Binance (margin enabled, futures enabled).
Current daily trading volume is hovering around $358m according to CoinGecko (https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/alpha-finance/historical_data/usd?end_date=2021-02-06&start_date=2020-11-06#panel).

['Managing cToken Versions'],"The Compound protocol (v2) has been evolving since its launch in 2019.
Initially, all cToken contracts were immutable; this fit well with the protocol’s reliance on an administrator (the team at Compound Labs), to give users confidence that the functionality of the protocol wouldn’t change unnecessarily. As the admin powers were weakened, and then replaced entirely by  Governance, new markets were introduced with upgradable cToken contracts.
The later-generation cToken contracts have a few advantages over the immutable, original model; the ability to sweep assets into other protocols (e.g. DAI into MakerDAO’s Dai Savings Rate), vote governance tokens, recover orphaned funds, and support future/upcoming features (like supply caps).
As follows, a list of cToken models:
ETH: Immutable
USDC: Immutable
WBTC: Immutable
ZRX: Immutable
BAT: Immutable
SAI: Immutable (deprecated)
REP: Immutable (deprecated)
DAI: Upgradable
USDT: Upgradable
UNI: Upgradable
COMP: Upgradable
The community may want to consider migrating cTokens.
Migrating a market from an immutable cToken contract, to an upgradable one, requires creating a new market for the asset. This would create a duplicate market (e.g., there are two ETH markets, with their own interest rates), which users would voluntarily migrate to. After a period of time, the original market could be deprecated.
The downside of duplicated markets include separate interest rates / incentives, chores for the ecosystem, potential user confusion, etc.
Sample Migration Process
As follows, is a sample migration process that could be used by the community, for an example asset (e.g. BAT):

Deploy a second cBAT contract (“new”), using the latest upgradable contracts; potentially deploy an updated interest rate model
Deploy an updated price feed proxy, to recognize new cBAT
Create a governance proposal, that adds support for new cBAT, and the new price feed proxy; set the new cBAT collateral factor and reserve factor equal to the legacy market;
Incentivize the migration to the new market; set the reserve factor on the legacy market to 100%, disable the COMP distribution to the legacy market, and activate the COMP distribution for the new market
After the ecosystem has had ample time to integrate the new market, deprecate the legacy market; disable supply/borrowing (but preserve repaying/withdrawing), and set the collateral factor for the legacy market to 0%

Ecosystem Considerations
Migrating assets is cumbersome, and the community may want to approach this slowly, e.g. not at all, or one market at a time. Interfaces, dashboards, and tooling would have to be updated to reflect the new market.
Would love others thoughts / considerations as part of this process.",64,1512.6,2021-02-16

 rleshner:

This would create a duplicate market (e.g., there are two ETH markets, with their own interest rates), which users would voluntarily migrate to.


Why not keep the user interface like it is? Only everytime a user supplies, it interacts with the new contract. Anytime users borrow, the old and new contracts, should be the exact same values as long as the price feed is the same. If you change the IRM, then the UI should show users a button to migrate to the new token if they want and have a “?” that will explain the upgraded cToken. Also, the UI could display 2 interest rates explaining that if supplied before X date APR is Old% on or after X date APR is New%.
If possible, everytime a user repays a debt, it uses the new contract and the new contract burns an equal amount of of the old contract’s cTokens from that user’s ETH address.
Another possibility would be to add both old and new cTokens supply and borrow to get the utilization percentage, after all, its the same underlying asset.
Eventually the old cTokens will all get recycled into the new cTokens.",31,6.0,2021-03-22
['Compound Grants Program Application: Compound Gateway Chain Integrate with Zenlink DEX Protocol'],"Overview
Based on the Compound Gateway Chain(hereinafter called Gateway) ecosystem’s further growth in the future and the rapid development of the Substrate-based blockchain technology, we propose that Gateway integrates with Zenlink DEX Protocol.
Zenlink is committed to building a new generation of cross-chain DEX networks based on Substrated and Rust. By integrating the Zenlink DEX Protocol, Zenlink can enable Substrate-based chains to quickly possess DEX capabilities(assets transfer, exchange, etc.) and quickly share liquidity with other chains.
For now, Zenlink has delivered two implementations: Zenlink DEX Module and Zenlink Smart Contract. They can be running in the runtime environment and ink! Module separately. They are deliverables of the Web3 Foundation Grant as well.
With their help, the Substrate-based chains projects, like Compound Gateway Chain, focus on their own business rather than worry about building a defi ecosystem on their chains.
Benefit
1. Gateway can have DEX capability quickly.
Gateway doesn’t need to implement dex functionality since Zenlink DEX Protocol has two implementations, so it is easy to be integrated. Zenlink has worked with some Polkadot parachains to implement the integration. It’s believed that these experiences will be beneficial to both Compound and Zenlink.
2. Assets on Gateway can be traded immediately.
Based on Zenlink’s AMM model, all the Gateway assets can create trading pairs and then exchange once the integration and deployment are finished.
3. Implementation of bringing peer chain assets into Gateway.
Due to the same framework - Substrate,  used by Gateway and Zenlink, it’s possible to complete a light Starport in Zenlink.

['Upgrade COMP distribution model. (Incentivized pools)'],"Why: Current COMP distribution model heavily weighted towards allocating capital in one, most efficient way, namely DAI market and basically directing pretty much all of the distribution towards specific capital, interested in “farming”. Current implementation was a temporary solution intended to solve massive gamification of system happening at introduction. Currently system allows to just extract value, with little to no benefits in development of protocol.
How: Instead of dispersing all COMP at current system, i suggest decrease current distribution by 30 to 50% (for example let’s take 30%). So from current 2300 COMP per day, distribution under current mechanism will go to 1700 COMP per day.
Another 700 COMP per day i suggest to disperse in different way, on top of current system.
I propose to set individual parameter for each existing pool, which could be set/changed by governance, controlling how much COMP per block that particular market recieve as incentive. Inside of market same 50% supply/borrow mechanic remain, as it proved to work fine so far.
That distribution should happen on top of current distribution, allowing for governance to route incentives to stimulate usage of markets which community think appropriate and in  amount which could be decided by governance, and which also could be changed in future.
As a conservative strategy i also suggest to set that parameters for reasonable amount of time like at least month, not like changing every week or so, for capital providers to be able to plan and adjust their strategies.",61,172.2,2020-09-22

Currently, each market is weighted proportional to borrowing demand, but alternate approaches could be simpler, and more fair. Over the past few months, many projects have experimented with incentive design, and being able to customize incentives could be a valuable tool for the community.
One possible approach (which would require community development) would be to replace the current refreshCompSpeed() function (and flags for which markets are enabled for the COMP Distribution), with a setCompSpeed(market) function callable by Governance.",55,81.0,2020-09-23

Raising old, irrelevant treads, rarely is productive action, and not in that case in particular. You should create your own with your idea of “halving”.
I don’t see much value in decreasing distribution, as it is actually one of the few ways of introducing decentralisation. Otherwise vast majority of voting power will stay in hands of VC. Besides, distribution per capital of liquidity is dropping fast naturally, as markets grow bigger and bigger thus, if you not grow your portion proportianally, your share of distribution becomes noticebly smaller every month already.

It’s like 3+ years ahead which is like light years in cryptocurrency.
And it’s not really emission. It’s distribution. No new COMP are being created by distribution. There is some logic in what you say, distributions could be reduced in favor of extending it further down the road, depending on a market valuation. But probably not quite yet. As i already explained before, everybody already getting less COMP per unit of capital provided, because Compound grew so much and distribution stays same. (actually it was already reduced once.)
And idea of advocating of cutting distrubution faster is same as advocating that Compound should be completely controlled by Venture capital forever.

['cCOMP Fix (With Solutions)'],"Hello, so I have found some issues with cCOMP and its COMP distribution, and I have an easy solution, so no worries.
cCOMP Dashboard
COMP Speeds
Latest COMP speeds recalibration
Regarding the COMP speeds and distribution:
Lets look at the data:

Interest Paid/Day=$10,597.82
10,597.82/474 = 22.35 Comp/day
(Speeds) COMP Per Day=65.70
To Borrowers (daily) =32.85
Supply APY 1.91%
Distribution APY=3.94%
Net Rate= 5.85%
Borrow APY=8.97%
Distribution APY=14.11%
Net Rate= -5.14%
Number of Borrowers=91

Borrowers are getting paid more comp than they pay in interest, meaning that they have no reason to ever pay it back, and are currently “locked” into farming and making a lot of leveraged comp. They are not participating in governance, they sold it/lent it.
If you do the math brought up in the recursive borrowing piece, and use the:

cCOMP Collateral Factor=60%
Iteration Sum:(1/(1-cfactor))
1/(1-.6)

Then:

Lending size is leveraged 2.5 times and 1.5 borrow with a net borrow rate of 5.85%, and -5.14% respectively
The original borrower can make 27.475% from borrowing and lending comp recursively

(Check the bottom of this post for accounts, take a look)
Another Issue arises when you look at the borrow caps.
This is the reason the borrowers are “locked”
borrow Caps
We have a borrow CAP on COMP,as is it stated in
Compound Chapter 2: Verse 27: Detail 5
(plz laugh, or chuckle; it was cute)

“A borrowing cap of 50k COMP is set as well.”
EDIT UPDATE: The borrow cap is under control of the community multisig, but with a limit at 100k (its at around 91k ATM)

A proposal is needed to up the comp the borrow cap, or lower the comp speeds.
Market liquidity:
In business, economics or investment, market liquidity is a market’s feature whereby an individual or firm can quickly purchase or sell an asset without causing a drastic change in the asset’s price
Utilization for cCOMP: Percentage of supplied funds that are borrowed, calculated as supply/borrow
But utilization is “the action of making practical and effective use of something.”
If you cant borrow any more because all of the allowed funds are being borrowed, then there’s effectively no liquidity and 100% Utilization.
So what?
Well, the liquidation system is THEORETICALLY tainted.
Lets say these accounts get margin called, someone’s gonna buy COMP on a DEX, and liquidate the portfolio.
Another way, in a self sustained enjoinment would be for another account to borrow comp on their own account, with no slippage, pay back the debt and close the account.
But… There’s no liquidity in this situation, even though the UI says there’s liquidity, on a closed end system (testnet, compound cash, extreme market conditions,Black Thursday), there could be a slight issue.
Again, this angle shouldn’t be too much of a concern, its mostly theoretical and to prove a point.
So, what’s the Solution?
For starters, we need to lower comp speeds on cCOMP to fix this imbalance.
Because we cant just yet change it from 50:50- Borrowers : Suppliers , cutting cCOMP speeds by 80% will make cCOMPS balance sheet make economic sense. From there we work on allowing different speeds other than 50:50.
Because hopefully soon we will have a grants committee up and sunning soon, I want to take half the COMP grant and attempt to fund this development, in a transparent, socially conscious and equitable way.
If you have any ideas about community development and equal opportunity in tech, PM me to help out.
So the changes:
From this:

Comptroller._setCompSpeed(“cCOMP”, 5000000000000000)
To this:

Comptroller._setCompSpeed(“cCOMP”, 1000000000000000)

Recursive leverage is somewhat tricky to define, so we instead used a lower bound as a proxy. Before looking at the data, we will first define what recursive borrowing is (and how it is used to maximize COMP rewards) and then describe we computed a proxy.

 Sirokko:

I just want to clear up some confusion here. Back when the cCOMP market was added, there was concern about governance manipulation though borrowing upwards of 100k COMP, as such, it was decided that setting the borrow cap above 100k is a significant action which should only be done by governance. The community multisig is following expectations, and raised the borrow cap multiple times until reaching this point.



 massnomis:

From there we work on allowing different speeds other than 50:50


I would like to see governance have the ability to fine-tune COMP distribution beyond the 50:50 allocation.
This issue goes much beyond the 50:50 COMP allocation though. While COMP holders definitely should receive special rewards from the protocol, I don’t believe that cCOMP is the means of distributing it. A long term staking process for COMP is needed, and personally, I don’t think this involves cCOMP. I don’t understand the drive to give the cCOMP market excess rewards, as this goes against the COMP agenda. Users who deposit to cCOMP are not participating in governance and forfeiting their voting power for monetary collateral and interest. The cCOMP market is needed, but I don’t it think should be manipulated with excess COMP rewards—an alternative for COMP staking with a different structure is needed. There is an argument to allow cCOMP holders to vote, but this comes with its own list of issues.
To fix this current situation, we need a new type of interest rate model which would be cognizant of the borrow cap. Treating the cap as 100% utilization would quickly “fix” the market. It is quite clear that there is significant excess demand at the borrow cap, and the interest rate should be higher. This in conjunction with lowering the cCOMP COMP distribution to be inline with other small-cap collateral assets (1950000000000000) makes sense.",44,178.8,2021-02-19

If the user borrows a COMP token is it a holder or shorter? He is obviously a holder by the very fact that he owns COMP. However I am interested in what is the positive implication of equal distribution (50:50) of COMP tokens to someone who is a long-term believer and to someone who play short on COMP?

Thank you for these questions.
“Traditional” Financially speaking, a user who borrows COMP is short the asset, because they owe it.
However, COMP being a governance token, there seems to be the idea that borrowed funds will be used for that, therefore they must have a strong belief in the underlying. However, if you look at the numbers, the borrower would benefit if COMP goes down. BUT… There’s comp speeds, and just like other markets, users, both on the long and the short side get compensated in COMP for their position.
This works perfectly for DAI, ETH, USDC, etc, but ccomp is spoecial because the “boost” is in kind.
That’s the problem with the ccomp market AS OF NOW, there is no good use case as of now for borrowing, besides for gaming the system. We do have some ideas in the works, like @arr00 said, like ccomp voting, VESTING and others.
As of now, the mechanics are as follows,
There is a multisig that allows to raise the borrow cap
-It was put in to make sure that there was no large borrows to avoid vote manipulation
-100k Limit, for whatever reason, (I wasn’t the decision maker, I don’t hate it or disagree, it just is) before something new comes up to a proposal.
There are 91 Borrowers GETTING PAID 5.85% to BORROW Comp.
These accounts, see above, are simply recursively borrowing/farming it.
the last time on discord The cap was raised publicly, it was to 85k, where the cap is now at like 91k.
Because there is no precedence for announcing new borrow limits in any other markets, only select accounts with this “inside information” (its viewable on etherscan its not a secret) have the ability to take advantage of this glitch.
The second the cap is updated, one tx can be made to borrow, supply, borrow supply, etc., to make 28% APY with zero risk on 4 times the total position (borrow+supply).
Its a pointless game and it makes it seem like supplying comp is a good idea, but no one is really borrowing because the borrowers being funded entirely by comp distribution and are taking on no risk.
Someone who is borrowing comp is clearly gaming the system and therefore does not belive in COMP’s long term success, because they would be open and honest about the problem.
Similar to the “free money glitch” robinhood had, it was patched quickly and individuals were barred from taking advantage.
Borrow cap raising will work, but doesn’t solve the issue, people will still game the system the second the cap is raised and the comp distrobution will foot the bill.
Right now the unrealized loss is over 30 COMP/day for the system as a whole (two separate contracts, ccomp and comptroller/unitroller?)
But if you look at both contracts from a zoomed out veiw, you can see the loss.
So  Raising the cap will NOT solve the problem, because with comp speeds like this it is still a game (also we have almost reached the 100k limit)
-But raising the cap will SEEM like it will help, more borrow demand will allow the “natural rate” to increase, but again, the borrow interest is paid by comp speeds.
Lowering comp speeds on ccomp will stop this little leverage/free money game, stopping select individuals with technical skills with intention to profit from the system.
-lowering comp speeds doesn’t make it perfect either, we still dont have a great use case for CCOMP, but we have some in the works.
To speed up this process, i suggested using some of the money we save (30/Comp a day, or $5.5 million a YEAR) to help fund and speed up community development.

“The last two actions take 622 Sai (currently valued at $1200) from reserves and transfer them to Arr00 as a bounty for his work on this proposal.” source
“1. Award ourselves a COMP grant (1000 COMP) to offset development and audit costs.” _grantcomp in Action

“So far it has been me and a few anonymous donors, but I’m hoping that it will be funded by the protocol eventually”
There is no precedence here, and even if there were, I don’t see it a a reason to continue down this way.
This is a clear example of survivorship bias, Imagine how many proposals could have gotten passed with payment upfront or along the way, because as of now you are the only pure example of successful community development within governance.
This post and hopefully CAP is not about the grants committee, rather I am exploring the affects that having a committee will have on community governance.
I would love to get some feedback on the following questions:

Do you feel like the the 30 comp would help with this?
Could it be utilized well in a transparent manner for the implementation of this idea?

We are looking for transparency in this process, with open documentation and financing along the way. How would you react/work with these new hypothetical implementations?",38,7.6,2021-02-21

Why is borrow cap a better solution than reducing COMP speed / ratio distribution?


50/50 distribution is just how protocol works currently, we can’t do uneven split at the moment. However to answer your question why i think raising a CAP is better solution, is because CAP itself is creating market imbalance.
You see, people are complaining that someone is getting paid to borrow COMP and then they can use it to supply it back, leveraging their position. It’s true, but that’s because no new borrowers can enter. By allowing, like another 50k borrowers to borrow, borrow rate will quickly become negative, and on COMP market rates are quite high, so ALL borrowers are going to pay for borrowing, instead of now none of the borrowers are paying for borrowing. COMP market CAP is just creating artificial non-market condition which makes that an issue.
I’m not really that much opposing decreasing COMP speed, the thing is it was hard enough to introduce even a little bit more inclusion of all markets in COMP distribution instead of dropping 80% of distribution to stable coins exclusevly. And now we discussing about taking it back and what? Put it back to stable coins? Or just decrease overall daily distribution if putting it nowhere? It’s not out of the table, but how it’s better than just letting COMP market to reach balance naturally. If it wouldn’t be able to do it with raising CAP, than sure, cutting distribution is logical next step.



 arr00:

I don’t understand the drive to give the cCOMP market excess rewards, as this goes against the COMP agenda. Users who deposit to cCOMP are not participating in governance and forfeiting their voting power for monetary collateral and interest.


I used to think that way also, but looking at developments in DeFi, i adjusted my opinion. I now don’t think holding COMP or, locking it in staking contract, or vesting should be really that much incentivised. Is extremelly capital-inefficient and just create dead capital.
cComp on the other hand is a sort of a wrapped COMP. It doesn’t itself take away capital from defi financial system, as it’s continie to work as collateral. I believe cCOMP probably should be upgraded to be used as primary location for COMP for long term holders and voters. It might be not the best solution, but it’s surely better than plain COMP and vested COMP. Staked COMP might be different, depending on what is actually done with that staked COMP, but since it’s not exist, cCOMP is the only thing what we have.
I understand concerns that some people have about borrowing COMP to be used in governance, even if personally don’t see it as an issue, so far nobody showed interest in borrowing COMP to propose something and i doubt it will happen in future, as even with 200k CAP it will easily be outvoted.
But that being said, while i was very much FOR COMP market, my main idea was to let COMP holders use it as collateral, to allow them use their capital, or at least portion of it, borrowing side excluded.
@arr00 Since you are active participant in Compound development side, here is another concept to think about. It might be relatively long-shot solution, but relatively simple to implement as it based on already existing code.
Introduction of cCOMP2 market. Why and for what:
Primary difference of cCOMP2 market from cCOMP market would be zero borrowing side, done with 0 borrow CAP. So COMP placed there would be able to used as collateral to borrow other tokens but not allowed to be lend.  That would allow long term holders to place their COMP there and not to be exposed to any risks from the borrow side.
Second, since cCOMP2 pool couldn’t be lend and just sit there in the same amount, then vote delegation could be introduced, so the Supplier to cCOMP2 could delegate his votes either to himsef, or to other address he choose. That would achieve second goal of letting Supplier to preserve it’s voting power.
As a future options, there could be done a sort of timelock, for example on ability to withdraw tokens from pool. As well as some additional rewards could be distributed to Suppliers (“Stakers”). “Stakers” could potentially also have a bigger voting weight in future or something like that. That would be logical step in evolution of governance for Compound from what it is currently.",34,61.8,2021-02-21

I understand your arguments and I think they are reasonable, however my opinion is that the COMP token itself does not have enough incentives on their native protocol (Compound). Given the “utility trade-off,” what is the capitalization advantage of COMP tokens over ETH or WBTC? Due to the smaller collateral factor (75% vs 60%) and the very low interest rate on the capitalization of the COMP token, there is a lack of economic incentives.

Compound Grants

85 Hours
I started working on this program in December 2020. I pitched Robert Leshner the idea of having a grants multisig after reading his “call to action” post in comp.xyz. After a few trying to look over what kind of research opportunities were provided and referenced in the post, I tried my best to go over to see how much time each idea would take to study. I thought the best angle for me was the economic policy and comp distribution. After a heavy amount of research during my own personal time, I realized how much work was to be done to improve compound, and that plenty of groundbreaking and innovative research needed to be done.
After a few posts in the forum I gathered some positive community feedback and learned some very important lessons, all while making some very important friends. Larry approached me a month or two in, and the rest is history.


Monetary Policy

25 hours
When I first started looking at compound, I thought that a great way to make markets “ideal” was to have a “fed”. This would be a large autonomous body that would borrow and lend, stake and collect comp in attempt to make the markets as efficient and “profitable” as possible. While this work was the basis that led to my understanding of the inner workings of compound, and after talking to Leshner about the idea, I saw that the idea of a monetary policy multisig was a few “defi summers” away. Nevertheless, it will be kept in my mind.


Reserves Research

18 Hours
I talked to some of my classmate who were also studying finance and asked them questions regarding the WACC, PE and some other financial metrics to view the compound protocol. It appeared to me that there was little precedence within the current academic and financial worlds to analyze decentralized financial institutions, or “self driving banks”. I tried my best to create a set of metrics in which to measure the performance of individual markets, and the protocol.


COMP IRM

25 Hours
A few years back I wrote a chapter in a book about on the affects that self driving cars would have on urban landscape. In my specific chapter, I learned and wrote about how street parking works, and how innovative cities like San Francisco price on street parking meters to maximize price and utility towards 80% capacity. This fascinated me because I realized that an ideal market must always has liquidity for new buyers, or lenders. When I first started learning about compound, I was immediately fascinated by the interest rate models. The biggest issue I saw at the time was the ccomp market. It made absolutely no sense to me. I decided to create an IRM for the ccomp market that will try to put UTIL at around 80%, all while maximizing efficiency and profitability, using new metrics I created on my own.


COMP Folding

15 Hours
Recursive lending is a problem (possibly) that compound has been quiet on. I decided to create my own framework to calculate recursive lending profitability, position sizes and comp distribution. I believe that this insight is important, because we need to analyses the possibilities of balance sheet expanding, monetary folding activities.

I love Ethereum because I love emerging technologies. Like many in the industry, I started with Bitcoin and then learned about Ethereum. I think it is natural to be curious and learn about new things. I think multi-chain technology is still very nascent but worth exploring. There is a lot more upside to exploring multi-chain options than downside.

Compound Chain will be Ethereum dominated for a while. I do not view it as Compound giving up on Ethereum, but instead, they are trying to use its best qualities and fix its worst ones.

"['ZRX,BAT, and WBTC Parameter Update']","We’d like to continue our efforts from last week to update parameters in the protocol. There was little on-chain opposition to our proposal but we failed to reach quorum and will be re-proposing along with our next change, to lower the WBTC collateral factor. We also got some great feedback from the community that they wanted to see more data from our stress tests and analysis, which we’ve included below. Obviously, higher capital efficiency for WBTC is something users really wanted (as we saw from the support for the proposal) but we believe this creates an untenable risk in the protocol.
In our next proposal, we plan to change the collateral requirements for ZRX, BAT, and WBTC.




Collateral

Recommended collateralFactor




ZRX
.60
.65


BAT
.60

WBTC

As we mentioned on Twitter recently, an increase in volatility for WBTC and the overall market has increased risk substantially across many defi protocols.
Currently, outside of the circular borrowing with DAI and USDC, much of the collateral on Compound is ETH and WBTC being used to borrow stables:
805×820 25.2 KB
While there are similar levels of usage for both ETH and WBTC, ETH has much better liquidity, and poses less risk. On our dashboard, we track a few relevant statistics to collateral safety:
1254×364 15.8 KB
One of these, which is admittedly a bit hard to grok, is the liquidity ratio. This is the ratio of the Real Daily Volume of the asset to the total amount of that asset used as collateral on Compound. Right now, that ratio is 1:5, which means that if markets were to take a tumble, Compound could attempt to sell 5x the current daily volume for WBTC in as little as a few hours. Now many people would say this sounds difficult, but the only way to understand if this could be done safely is to either 1) try it or 2) simulate it. Since option one is financially infeasible, we chose to try option two.
We have run thousands of simulations across a wide variety of price trajectories, but with updated data since our last post. The tail risk of WBTC continues to increase. We’ll focus on the main output of the simulations, which is “Net Insolvent Value” per collateral type. This is highly dependent on price volatility, which we vary across the x-axis below. A “Volatility Scalar” of 1 means that the stress tests used price paths that matched the historical volatility of each asset, a scalar of 7 corresponds to price paths that are 7 times as volatile as recent asset prices. For reference, the historically bad volatility of March 12/13, 2020 corresponds to a scalar of about a 7. In the graphs below, we show two sets of sample simulation price trajectories so you can all have a clear idea of what this looks like.
1600×823 167 KB
You’ll notice that in the prices move together - this is because price trajectories are parameterized to match historical correlations. The expected loss to the protocol in an extreme market event has more than doubled since we first raised concerns:
664×708 18 KB
This is due to adverse liquidations in the WBTC market. In our sim, you can see that the majority of protocol liquidations happen in the ETH and WBTC markets, but since ETH has so much better liquidity than WBTC, these do not contribute strongly to the risk of insolvency:
816×840 25.8 KB
@sirokko recently asked how we estimate slippage for liquidators, and while we briefly touched on it here, I wanted to elaborate on that. We use Coinbase data to determine the order book structure, which fits the curve we use for slippage. We then scale that by a factor Real Volume / Coinbase Volume to create a curve that represents the entire market. The volume on Uniswap is included in this, however assuming x*y=k style slippage in the market is a very conservative assumption. In fact, we’ve tried this, and then the simulation sees insolvencies in even pretty normal (but bad) market conditions, and we know that not to be the case, so we continued to develop our model that fits and scales real order book data. One thing that we do consider here are gas fees. We add gas price and transaction delay implications by building gas distribution curves on three month trailing data, and use random samples in our liquidator logic. In addition, we fit expected transaction delay times to liquidation calls.
We plan to create another proposal through the governance contract later this week, once people have had a chance to provide feedback on these proposed changes.",82,3566.4,2021-02-20
"['ZRX,BAT, and WBTC Parameter Update']","While i’m not opposing this proposal, there are several thinghs i wanted to higlight, hopefully for better picture.
For ZRX and BAT market this increase risk-taking ability for users, which i still think now isn’t a great time to allow in current market situation. However, taking in account the size of markets, and relatively small change introduced (proposed number of CF is still very conservative) i’m willing to take Gauntlet arguments, that it’s going to be fine.
For WBTC market though, since it’s involves decreasing collateral factor, i would like to see some sort of estimation of impact on current borrow positions before that’s put into vote. I believe no government decision should by itself put users underwater. So if decreasing CF put considerable amount of users into liquidation, or close to liquidation than it should not be executed. Or at least executed gradually, slowly taking CF down in several steps, rather than in one big cut of 15%.
In that particular case, while i don’t quite share Gauntlet concerns about how bad liquidity of WBTC is, in current market condition having more conservative CF would indeed reduce amount of potential risk for protocol, and for users as well. That’s why i do not feel strongly against decreasing CF here, though, i would probably suggest it higher than 60% still.
Now why i still not convinced by results presented by model. I would like to see model accounting for on-chain liquidity, rather than just looking at daily trading volume.
Here are just simple reference numbers.
WBTC supplied to Compound : $2186M
WBTC/ETH LP Sushiswap:      $1007M
WBTC/ETH LP 1inch:            $553M
WBTC/ETH LP Uniswap:        $416M
There’s hardly a liquidity problem to liquidate like even 30% of Compound WBTC supply using exclusively this 3 DEXes and not touching CEX liquidity at all. And i, by the way, think that if we see like 30% BTC price drop within a day, liquidations will go in majority via DEXes, rather than CEXes, as in times of violent price movement (especially downside) we could easily observe how they either completely go down or “experience degraded perfomance” making it not so much suitable as a liquidation instrument.",67,148.4,2021-02-22

If we dropped the CF of WBTC to 60% again, these 7 accounts would immediately be liquidatable, the top 5 hold about 26M in collateral right now:
[‘0x4815b52fee7a689b000958bec010720d210377c1’,

We absolutely want to minimize impact on borrowers, and that’s one of the reasons we built this dashboard.  Hopefully, borrowers who are pushing the limits of their collateral positions will be paying attention to governance at the least, but this dashboard should give people a further heads-up on changes. Changing parameters is essential to protocol safety and success over time, and while there are tradeoffs with the UX for users, we will continue to do what we can to make those tradeoffs as positive for Compound as possible.
Re liquidity assumptions, If you were to imagine liquidating a mere 50mm of BTC on Uniswap:
image430×587 37 KB
You’d see a >20% price impact. This would push many other positions through the liquidation threshold. It’s not that our model doesn’t incorporate on-chain liquidity, it’s that looking only at on-chain liquidity is not a good assumption on this scale.",62,97.4,2021-02-22
"['ZRX,BAT, and WBTC Parameter Update']","Yes, that’s quite what i mean when i said the model should account for onchain liquidity.
Your example with Uniswap follow that, but intentionally or not, you selected a place with lowest WBTC liquidity on chain for your example.
Let’s take a look at sushi:
sushi_c373×600 36.9 KB
But considering you want to deal with millions i seriously doubt anybody would use just a single pool of liquidity, so here is the same  trade on 1inch, routed through several pools:
1inch_c478×609 48.7 KB
Of course, telling that on-chain liquidity is only thing we should care was never my intention. I very much encourage using as much data, as available. The only thing i want to say, it shouldn’t be ignored either, as it is not negligble anymore. And volume at DEX is not good enough as ONLY metric, as they hold much more liquidity, than their daily volume is. Especially if we talk about suchi, 1inch pools, where liquididy is incentivised. Daily volume is a small fraction of their liquidity, most of it just sit there without trading. (untill price spike happen)
To make my point really short and simple. If we say:
a) ETH have no problem with liquidations (as shown by your model)
b) WBTC have no problems in converting to ETH (as delivered from onchain  liquidity)
Then if A and B is true, than
c) WBTC should have little problems with liquidations also.
Of course, there is additional step and transactional expenses, so it might not be as good as ETH, but certanly not 10 or 20 times worse in liquidity.
That’s not said to say that decreasing CF for WBTC is bad idea. It might be not. I believe after so many X in price some tokens done, lowering risk might be appropriate, even if it’s somewhat enforced on users. I just want you to maybe take a look at your model from outside perspective. Maybe DEXes, should not be just a single daily volume metric, and dex liquidity is not exactly quite same as cex orderbook either.",60,52.0,2021-02-22

If we do nothing, and the markets are only as volatile than they have been in the last twelve months, then:

We should expect an event in which about 7% of the 2 billion dollars of WETH in compound is liquidated.
Since a portion of profit for liquidators can come from the compound pool itself, this could negatively affect the solvency of one or more compound pools?
This liquidation event would have a very large, rapid, and self-reenforcing negative effect on the price of BTC worldwide.

The top 10 cWBTC holders account for 60% of cWBTC. The top 100 cWBTC holders account for 91% of cWBTC. The top 10 users are highly incentivized to keep their wallets far away from liquidation, and many are high-sophisticated users. If I had more free time, I would love to analyze each of these user’s accounts because their activity and usage are likely valuable in our decision-making.

I love the work that Gauntlet is doing and acknowledge they are highly skilled. Their simulations are certainly helpful for monitoring the risks the protocol has.

In my opinion, as a long-time participant in Compound and generally DeFi, their methodology could better account for the liquidity available onchain. Currently, they focus on traded volume as the best indication for liquidity. Before Uniswap/Sushiswap and other AMMs had significant liquidity, I would have used the same trading volume stat they are using to measure liquidity; however, a significant amount of onchain liquidity has built up in recent months, and purely measuring trading volume is no longer sufficient.",54,125.8,2021-02-24
"['ZRX,BAT, and WBTC Parameter Update']","To stay focused on proposal itself, i think it’s worth to mention that despite of discussion going towards Gauntlet model, that isn’t main point of this discussion. I believe concerns, raised by Gauntlet certanly is enough as a reason to discuss lowering CF for WBTC, even if I might not share the scale of that concerns.
I certanly hope that last couple days of market volatility allowed to gather more data, which might reinforce either position.
Than surely WBTC liquidity isn’t quite equal to ETH liquidity, and in light of concerns from the model, governance can and should consider decreasing CF.
The scale of proposed changes should be conservative enough to not put users immediately into liquidation, regardless of “they should know better” arguments.
So, if putting CF from 75 to 60 puts users into liquidation, than change should be more conservative, to prevent it as much, as possible. If 65 doesn’t improve situation either, than we should go with 75 to 70. Which is probably most conservative approach possible. If decreasing CF by mere 5% cause liquidations, i don’t think governance could do anything about that.
Considering market volatility in last couple days, i’d say executing most careful and conservative approach in lowering CF might be appropriate. And certanly likely to get more support among voters rather than big 15% cut. Especially if we remember that increase to 75% was introduced just couple weeks ago, and even if we exclude Gauntlet voting “for” by mistake, still gathered quite a significant support.
And yet, in current market conditions, having somewhat more conservative CF for WBTC than 75% might be appropriate.",56,96.2,2021-02-24
"['ZRX,BAT, and WBTC Parameter Update']","I understand Gauntlet is a company and can’t give up the “secret sauce” to their analytical methods. But I’d love to see more specifics on model inputs (+ maybe outputs). Eg for the liquidity and volatility data, which specific sources are used and what is the method of computation for aggregate final numbers. Or any probability distributions of expected losses (net insolvent) so people can understand the nature of the risk to the protocol (eg thin or fat tail).
It’s tough for me to get fully behind the proposal when I can’t inspect the underlying model assumptions.",53,55.6,2021-02-24

"['ZRX,BAT, and WBTC Parameter Update']","Just a quick question. Since I don’t see adresses duplicate at 65 and 70 CF, i assume assets for liquidation at 65 CF do not include assets going for liquidation at 70 CF? So basically if CF is set to 65, then we going to put 4 729 790 + 9 821 799 for liquidation?
I still believe decreasing CF in steps is more responsible action: lowering it to 70 first with second followup proposal lowering it to 65 going next would be a better approach.
If timing is critical, than second proposal could be put to vote before first one finish, giving it 24 to 48 hours delay after first proposal put, to give time for borrowers to adjust their positions after execution of first part to avoid being put for liquidations.
As for everything in general i think it should already be put to vote, as not much remained to discuss here really. I think all main arguments are already being presented. I still not really convinced about liquidity assumptions your model gives. As i look at that massive onchain liquidity for wbtc-eth (Uni 355M + Sushi 729M + 1inch 535M= over 1.5B) and it’s hard to believe that even 100M trading volume = low liquidity. Besides for last 24 hours only uni and sushi created 37M+38M = 75M of WBTC trading volume, so 125M doesn’t look accurate at all. Could all CEX combined generate less trading volume for WBTC than only 2 DEXes alone.
Yet, i believe, lowering CF is still good idea, as WBTC market is huge on Compound, and after all the bull run it would be smart to stay on safe side, and decrease amount of risk users could take on WBTC. So i’m for your proposal, just not quite convinced by the arguments of low liqudity.
However, I’d say better be safe than sorry, so if your model say that we should derisk WBTC market, than we should. Maybe your model is somewhat right, who knows.",52,190.4,2021-03-03

['Compound Grants Program'],"tl;dr: We (Larry, Jesse, Getty, Aparna, Monetsupply, Ken, Sam, and Ryan) want to start a grants program to provide funding to Compound’s community. The purpose of this thread is to share our proposal and receive feedback from the community. If the feedback from the community is positive, we will share an address you can delegate votes to.

Summary
We propose to start a program called the Compound Grants Program (“CGP”), which will provide funding to projects, ideas, and events that benefit Compound and its stakeholders. If approved, funding for the program will come from Compound’s treasury, which currently holds ~200k COMP (~$95mm as of 03/01/21). As a reminder, the treasury currently accrues 0.5 COMP per block, spends 0.352 COMP per block on liquidity incentives, and saves the balance of 0.148 COMP per block for governance by tokenholders.
The program will be a pilot. For this reason, we believe it’s prudent to limit the program’s dollar value to $1mm per quarter and the length to two quarters for a cost of $2mm (4,444 COMP) over six months.
Since it’s not practical to solicit a community vote for every disbursement, we propose forming a small and nimble committee that has the power to administer the grants at its own discretion (limited by the aforementioned dollar and length caps). We suggest forming a committee of eight members: one lead member to head the program and seven reviewing members to review the lead’s work and assist with program operations. The committee will operate with a 4 of 7 multi-sig (only reviewers will be part of the multi-sig).
As compensation for administering the program, we propose the lead be paid $5k upfront and $100 per hour thereafter with a cap of 30 hours per week for a maximum compensation of $83k (184 COMP). In total, we are asking for a maximum of ~5,000 COMP to fund the grants (4,444 COMP), program setup and operational costs (444 COMP), and compensation for the program lead (184 COMP). All unspent funds will be returned to the community treasury at the conclusion of the CGP.
Purpose
Decentralized projects are living and breathing communities with a variety of stakeholders. These stakeholders include project team/contributors, tokenholders, users, partners, and for certain projects, liquidity providers. The goal for the CGP is to nurture Compound’s ecosystem to benefit all of these stakeholders. To be more specific, the grants program aims to:


Grow Compound’s ecosystem by funding development happening on top of it. Funding development focused on helping Compound grow is critical to the project’s long-term success.


Fund ideas that benefit Compound that would otherwise not receive funding. Many good ideas are left unexplored because they fail to receive funding. We intend to make sure as few good ideas as possible are underfunded or unfunded.


Strengthen goodwill by providing funding for community-led ideas. Funding projects, ideas, and events brought forth by community members will encourage more active participation by the community. It will have the added benefit of nourishing goodwill. A well-nourished goodwill keeps community members loyal and happy, which in turn, encourages new members to join what they see is a thriving community.


Program Scope
The CGP was heavily inspired by the Uniswap Grants Program (“UGP”), which received approval from the community to deploy a maximum of $750k per quarter for two quarters. It’s difficult to deploy a meaningful amount of money to ecosystem grants without compromising on quality. While we believe all of these ecosystems will be enormous in the future, it’s important for us to be practical today by matching the grants budget to the size of the ecosystem.
To that end, the pilot program will deploy a maximum of $1mm per quarter and run for two quarters. We have no way of knowing whether this amount of money is overshooting or undershooting the needs of the ecosystem — we will only find out after running the experiment. For example, if we find out $2mm is not enough money to fund all of the high quality opportunities, we as a community may decide we need to create a larger allocation for grants. On the flipside, if we find out $2mm is too much, all unspent funds will be returned to the community treasury for use at a later time.
As part of the program, our intention is to fund projects, ideas, and events that directly benefit Compound and its stakeholders. While there may be opportunities to fund projects, ideas, and events that indirectly benefit Compound, these opportunities fall outside the scope of this program.
Not all opportunities applying for grants will benefit the Compound ecosystem equally. To help us prioritize which ideas to fund, we propose the following buckets:
High priority


Protocol and parameter development. Apart from acts of stewardship and generosity, there is little to no incentive for community members to propose technical updates to the protocol. With no carrot with which to motivate community members to propose changes, the protocol isn’t able to innovate as quickly as it should be innovating in a dynamic and competitive market. We should note that in a minority of cases community members did receive payment for work done (for example, see the work done by Gauntlet on the COMP Contributor Grants proposal), although here too, the incentive to contribute was not well-designed since it required Gauntlet to front audit and development costs before knowing the proposal to pay them would pass. To encourage community members to propose changes, the CGP will fully or partially pre-fund development and audit costs. In doing so, we hope to encourage more proposals, which will lead to more innovation and as a result, a far better Compound for all of us.


Code audits. Making technical updates to the protocol is risky business: smart contracts are immutable and control billions of dollars in user funds. An error in a technical update can have serious consequences. Because of this, it is considered best practice to have an auditor review the proposed update for soundness prior to its submission. Unfortunately, these audits are expensive, particularly for individual contributors who need to pay for them out of pocket. We intend to provide grants that pre-fund audit costs for soon-to-be proposals. We hope this will encourage more individual contributors to propose technical updates to the protocol.


Business development / integrations. A greater amount of liquidity makes Compound a better product for all users. To grow liquidity, Compound should be integrated with as many applications as possible. To that end, we aim to fund integrations that grow usage of Compound. In funding integrations, we will effectively be funding the business development function for the protocol.


Advertising and sponsorships. It will be important to get the word out there about this program. The more people there are that know about the CGP, the more applications we should expect to receive. To spread the word about the program, we will spend funds to advertise the CGP on podcasts, newsletters, and other mediums that attract the audience we want to attract.


Medium priority


Hackathons. It’s very likely that there exist uses for Compound that haven’t been explored yet. Hackathons are a fantastic way to explore design spaces, and the CGP intends to sponsor them.


Bounties. This one speaks for itself: bug fixes and minor protocol updates will be covered by the CGP.


Low priority


Miscellaneous improvements. It’s difficult to know ahead of time all of the grant applications that will come through. Just because an application does not fit neatly into one of the above buckets doesn’t mean it’s not valuable to the Compound ecosystem. So long as an application benefits Compound directly, we will consider it for a grant.


Applications for miscellaneous improvements to Compound fall into this bucket. Because the scope of this bucket is broad, we consider it to be low priority compared to the narrowly scoped buckets above.


While we did our best to prioritize items among each of the three buckets, we are confident that the above list is not all-inclusive. We expect to receive grant applications for phenomenal ideas that we simply can’t think of today. The committee asks the community for the right to exercise discretion to fund ideas that are beneficial to Compound but are not part of the scope outlined above.
Process and Timeline
If approved, the program will begin shortly after this proposal passes and end six months following the start of the program. (In other words, if the proposal passes on 3/15/2021 and begins on 3/22/2021, it will end on 9/22/2021). The program will run on a rolling process: we will welcome applications at any point in time during the program length! We will stop accepting applications two weeks before the end of the program (during these two weeks, we will start wrapping the program up, which will include evaluating the last of the applications and returning unspent funds to the treasury).
We will source potential grants via an applications process. (We will be sharing the application soon after this proposal passes).
Once an application is received, CGP committee members will discuss the application and evaluate it in the context of its benefit to Compound and its stakeholders. If the committee approves the application, funds will be paid out to the receiving party on the timely basis. If the committee does not approve the application, the soliciting party will be notified as to why the application was not approved and, if applicable, what steps need to be taken to have the application approved in the future. All approved grants and their amounts will be disclosed to the community publicly and on a timely basis.
A simplified diagram of the grants approval and disbursement process can be found below.

diagram image1906×214 52.1 KB

Finally, a member of the CGP committee will participate in the bi-weekly Compound community developer calls. We will attend the call, listen to what the community thinks should be funded, and present some of the newly funded grants.
Committee Members
The CGP committee will consist of eight members: one lead and seven reviewers. We believe the best committees share two features: first they must be capable, and second they must be motivated to actively participate. We believe this committee shares these two vital features.
Lead
Larry Sukernik (Sheepshead Bay, LLC)
Reviewer
Getty Hill (Grapefruit Trading)
Reviewer
Aparna Krishnan (Opyn)
Reviewer
Monetsupply (Independent)

Ken Ng (Ethereum Foundation)

Sam Simons (Independent)

Jesse Walden (Variant)

Ryan Yi (Independent)
The lead will be tasked with managing and operating the program while reviewers will have a duty of holding the lead accountable. To guarantee accountability, the committee will operate with a 4 of 7 multi-sig managed by the reviewers (note that the lead is not part of the multi-sig). In other words, four out of seven reviewers will need to sign the transaction for a grant to be approved and disbursed.
Committee Compensation
We propose the lead be paid $5k upfront and $100 per hour thereafter with a cap of 30 hours per week for a maximum compensation of $83k (~184 COMP). Since the majority of the work will be performed by the lead, they will be the only committee member to receive payment as part of the program pilot. Payments to the lead will be approved by the reviewers and made according to the following schedule: $5k upfront, with the balance paid at the end of each quarter (i.e., if the program begins on 3/22/21, the lead will be paid $5k on 3/22/21, and the again on 6/22/21 and 9/22/21 based on hours worked).
The funds for both the program and the lead’s pay will be allocated to the CGP multi-sig from the Compound treasury. Running the CGP will come with setup and operational costs; we will set aside approximately 10% of the CGP budget to cover these costs. All unspent funds will be returned to the community treasury at the conclusion of the CGP.
What Does Success Look Like?
We expect success to come in two forms: one that’s measurable and the other that’s of the “you know it when you see it” type.
Measurable success metrics:

Number of projects, ideas, and events funded
Community engagement (e.g., increased activity on forums, Discord, and so forth)
Increase in number of applications

“Know it when you see it” success metrics:

Improved sentiment and goodwill within the community
Improvement to Compound’s brand and positioning in the market

Conclusion
If approved, the CGP will begin accepting applications for grants on a rolling basis shortly after its approval. To assist with the evaluation of potential grants, each grant will be classified into three buckets: high, medium, and low. High priority grants will be funded first; medium priority grants will be funded second; low priority grants will be funded last.
This program is a pilot. As such, we intend to keep the budget lean for a maximum disbursement of ~5,000 COMP over six months across grants, setup and operational costs, and lead compensation. Make no mistake: this is an experiment. If the CGP works, Compound may want to graduate the program from a pilot to a full-time endeavor. If it doesn’t work, we will learn why it didn’t work and what should be done differently. Most of us are COMP holders here. That gives the privilege to try something that’s never been tried before at a meaningful scale: to let the test subjects run the experiments.

['Compound Grants Program'],Kudos for taking the initiative and moving forward with this proposal! I’d love to know how y’all ended up reaching the conclusion that a committee is the right solution here. I am actually inclined to think that’s the wrong direction for governance - I would much prefer to see us move in the direction of more radically transparent in all things - and would love to see COMP holders large and small incentivized to ‘stake’ votes of confidence rather than paying a small group of people to make decisions for everyone else.,94,103.8,2021-03-01
['Compound Grants Program'],"Thank you @sukernik and everyone involved in drafting this program. Having a community-organized grants program will grow the ecosystem in dozens of ways that are currently limited by the proposal process (which was originally imagined as autonomous, with the ability to add programs like this down the road).
Presently, there’s not a clear path for the community to propose improvements, have their journey supported, and deliver improvements. I’m extremely excited for this pilot/experiment.
That being said, a few basic questions / areas to clarify:
Membership

Why should the community, and COMP token-holders trust you? What are your qualifications, and background? What is your experience in the Compound community to date?
What about the other members, that disburse funds?
Should the members be active Compound community participants? Some names I don’t recognize from Discord or these forums.
Nobody on the list (to my knowledge) has a deep familiarity with the protocol codebase, which might be useful in quantifying grants for technical development.

Grants Process

In the case of a protocol development, do you envision a grant before work is completed, after it is completed, after it is merged into the protocol? At what stage of development, would somebody apply for a grant? In the workflow, this isn’t made clear.
It seems like somebody would (or should) apply before completing development work (or another type of contribution). Would you disburse funds, partially disburse funds (with the remainder at a later stage), or communicate a “provisional” grant/acceptance?
Any steps in mind to eliminate potential fraud?

Overall, I see this as providing huge upside to the community, and the ability to participate.",94,268.8,2021-03-01
['Compound Grants Program'],"I think a program like this is just the thing COMP needs to incentivize and scale broader community participation.  I believe that a critical component to the success of any protocol’s governance is that it cast as wide a net as possible to incentivize anyone, regardless of their resources, to be able to contribute to a protocol and be compensated on the basis of that contribution’s merit.
To jared’s comment, I believe a program like this can be effective - I believe these are smaller initiatives that do not require full weigh-in from all COMP holders, and can be delegated to a committee.  This will ensure things get funded and action is taken, instead of bogged down with potentially onerous procedure.
To rleshner’s comment, I do believe it is important to ensure that the community has faith that this committee is knowledgeable, transparent, and fair.",83,66.6,2021-03-01

I believe these are smaller initiatives that do not require full weigh-in from all COMP holders

I agree that not everything necessarily needs to happen on-chain or as a governance proposal, but I think there’s a huge spectrum of design space in between full governance proposals for everything and delegated to a committee.
Also I agree with the goals here, so I’m glad that we are talking about this.",77,15.4,2021-03-01
['Compound Grants Program'],"I support this, but I did not see repairing oracle solutions and compensating damaged users (or at least a statement) among the listed priorities.
I think we should first pay attention to things that don’t work on protocol.
There are several threads that stagnate here in the forum where users of the Compound community mostly share the same opinion and seek change, however there is a lack of technical knowledge to implement the proposals.
I would prefer that the interests of your team be aligned with the interests of the users and that these be priorities. That will be win-win situation.

And i dont like expressions like this because it sounds to me like you’re addressing a board of directors of a joint stock company. The very purpose of the DeFi and DAO concept is for users to manage the protocol, so you can start with that.

I can’t think of a structure off the top of my head but one which would be much nicer is if it prioritised autonomy of individuals to contribute and realise that a few thousands might be misallocated but it makes it easy for grass roots contribution to occur.
If I have a $5000 request there’s literally 5 steps and plenty of stakeholders to get through (lead, multisig, community lobbying etc). With programs like this it’s usually well connected folks who can request the most and lobby for the most.
I could probably be entirely wrong with all of this but just my 2c ",72,39.4,2021-03-01
['Compound Grants Program'],"It’s an important question, and one we considered seriously as we were developing the proposal. And I should add: even though we’re one committee, our views on this topic are multiple. I’ll reply with my thoughts, and the other committee members can chime in with theirs if they’d like.
Ideally, 100% of the tokenholders would be active members of the governance process. In that ideal world, people who contribute to Compound would ask tokenholders for a grant, and tokenholders —100% of whom are active members of governance process — would vote to approve or deny the grant request in a reasonable amount of time. While that would indeed be ideal, it’s unfortunately not practical today. Tokenholders are unlikely to have the time to review and approve dozens of small grants, and even if they did find the time, the process would certainly operate far more slowly than the speed of a nimble committee. And speed, I believe, is a critical ingredient for a successful grants program. The more quickly you move, the better the process is for grants applicants. A better process leads to more applicants, which leads to a more successful grants program.
In short, it’s not so much that we wanted to form a committee as a committee happened to be the least-bad option for piloting a small-scale grants program!",69,43.8,2021-03-02
['Compound Grants Program'],I am glad we could work together on this!,63,27.6,2021-03-02
['Compound Grants Program'],"We’re excited about running this experiment too!
The questions you pose are all very good and the community should get an answer to them. Let’s see if I can do a good job of answering them.

Why should the community, and COMP token-holders trust you? What are your qualifications, and background? What is your experience in the Compound community to date?

I spent the last three years investing at Digital Currency Group (DCG). During that time, I invested in 100+ companies and projects (some went on to be very successful, and some, umm…did not go on to be very successful). Early this year, I left DCG to work on something that I think is critically important and all at once underinvested in: network governance. That’s how I find myself here today.
Unfortunately, I didn’t have the time to actively participate in Compound’s community while I was at DCG. Since early this year, however, I have been lurking on the forum and Discord on a daily basis. Going forward, I plan to be a far more active member of the community. (Less lurking and more posting).

What about the other members, that disburse funds?

We tried very hard to make sure members of the committee represent the interests of various stakeholders in the community and/or have experience in providing funding to projects in the space. Jesse is an investor at Variant (and a16z before that). Getty, Monetsupply, and Sam are independent members of the Compound community. Ken has deep experience with the grants process thanks to his work for the Ethereum Foundation. Finally, Ryan works at Coinbase, and before that, was an investor at CoinFund. I’m biased, of course, but I think we have some very high quality committee members!

Should the members be active Compound community participants? Some names I don’t recognize from Discord or these forums.

Active community members are absolutely critical to the success of the program. Few know what areas/people Compound should provide grants to as well as they do. We tried our best to form a committee that’s well-rounded: it has both active community participants as well as folks who know how to provide funding to projects and ideas. Having said that, we’re always open to hear from other community members who’d like to get involved.

Nobody on the list (to my knowledge) has a deep familiarity with the protocol codebase, which might be useful in quantifying grants for technical development.

That’s certainly a weakness of the committee today. We’d absolutely love to hear from people who are familiar with the codebase.

In the case of a protocol development, do you envision a grant before work is completed, after it is completed, after it is merged into the protocol? At what stage of development, would somebody apply for a grant? In the workflow, this isn’t made clear.

This is a question we hope to have an informed answer on after we get data points from running the grants program for several months. Certain applications, for example, would benefit from receiving a grant before the work is completed. Other applications may benefit from receiving a grant after the work is finished. Applications that have several intermediate stages may benefit from a hybrid approach: part of the grant is given upfront, part is given once intermediate stages are completed, and part is given once the work is merged into the protocol. We hope to have a better answer to the question after running the pilot and seeing what works and what doesn’t work. After several months of experimentation, best practices should start to emerge.
Since we don’t have the best practices yet, we’ll want to start with the largest funnel we can to get as many data points as possible. To that end, when we start, we would accept applicants who are at any stage of the development process: those who haven’t started the work yet, those who have completed some of the work but have several more steps to go, and finally, those who have completed the work and merged it into the protocol but haven’t yet received payment for a job well done.

It seems like somebody would (or should) apply before completing development work (or another type of contribution). Would you disburse funds, partially disburse funds (with the remainder at a later stage), or communicate a “provisional” grant/acceptance?

I think the above answer covers this question too.

Any steps in mind to eliminate potential fraud?

Being a victim to fraud is the cost of doing business, particularly in this space. While we will take utmost care in screening out bad actors, mistakes may occur and losses may be incurred. That said, a small potential loss shouldn’t prevent us from doing something that has a chance of delivering a large potential gain to the community.
To keep the probability of loss as low as possible, we will likely need to verify the identity of each applicant prior to disbursing a grant. That is how we can ensure no baddies make it through the grants process. If this is indeed the final approach we take, we will be extremely careful with protecting the identity of applicants (the only people who would see their identity are members of the grants committee). But we’re still thinking this part through, so input from the community would be very welcome!",65,98.0,2021-03-02
['Compound Grants Program'],"Thanks for the comments @dabar90!

…but I did not see repairing oracle solutions and compensating damaged users (or at least a statement) among the listed priorities.

Repairing oracle solutions would certainly fall into the scope of the program (my guess is it would fall into the protocol and parameter development category). As far as compensating damaged users goes — do you think a grants committee should be handling that, or would a separate governance proposal be the better option?

I would prefer that the interests of your team be aligned with the interests of the users and that these be priorities. That will be win-win situation.

We’re in agreement! But at the same time, we want to keep the scope of the program manageable so as not to boil the ocean. We will be listening to user requests closely: if there is something they want to improve on Compound but lack the technical knowledge to do so, we will encourage them to find someone with the technical knowledge, apply for a grant, and make the improvement.

And i dont like expressions like this because it sounds to me like you’re addressing a board of directors of a joint stock company. The very purpose of the DeFi and DAO concept is for users to manage the protocol, so you can start with that.

I think that’s a completely fair comment. At the same time, I do think the term stakeholder is apt because it captures users who use Compound but aren’t actively managing it. How else do we call these people? Do their interests matter?",61,97.2,2021-03-02
['Compound Grants Program'],"This an extremely important point. We are well aware that most grants programs are annoying to apply to, require some degree of lobbying, and in general, are a dreadful process for the applicant. We want to make the process as quick and easy for applicants as possible.
We’re still finalizing the process, but perhaps I can share some of the details that will hopefully encourage you to apply if the proposal passes.
Applying will be fast. We will ask applicants for only the most important information. The application won’t take more than 30 minutes.
Approvals will be fast. We won’t require applicants to jump through hoops to receive a grant. They won’t need to lobby all of the reviewers. That would stink, and it would prevent applicants from applying ever again. Our default position is applicants are here because they care about improving Compound. With that in mind, we will be optimistic with approvals. (We’re not gatekeepers; rather, our goal is to open as many doors as possible).
You don’t need to be well-connected. But you do need to care about Compound and have the ability to make it better.

['Compound Grants Program'],"Thanks @sukernik and everyone else involved in bringing this forward. A well-structured COMP grants program should help encourage a broader set of developers and community members to come forward and contribute to the ecosystem. As you note, the need to front audit and other development costs is often a prohibitive barrier to all but the most well-funded development teams. A grants program could help address this issue and bring more diversity and breadth to the ecosystem. It could also fund smaller, one-off “growth” projects that are too small or otherwise not practical to bring through the full governance process.
While delegating authority to a committee does have certain downsides (as @jared notes), I think in this case it’s worth the tradeoff, for a few reasons. First, any updates to the core protocol would still need to be passed through the formal governance process before being merged. The committee itself would only be empowered to disburse funds to help defray some of the upfront development and audit costs. Second, for grants not involving core protocol development, the relatively small size of the budget - together with the 4-of-7 multisig design - further limits the downside risk of bad actors trying to abuse the system. And finally, as discussed above, the program could meaningfully broaden the set of community members who are able to contribute to the protocol, which should in turn enhance overall protocol health. Collectively, these factors weigh in favor of the committee structure for this specific use case, at least on an experimental basis.
Operationally, the program should aim for efficiency while also not becoming overly bureaucratic (per @kermankohli’s comment above). One way to help strike this balance is to scale the amount of reporting, disclosures, etc. that a grantee has to provide alongside the amount of funding requested. For example, it seems reasonable that a project requesting $250,000 should have to provide more robust disclosures and reporting than a project requesting $5,000. A basic tiering system along these lines could help to reduce the risk of fraud while also not over-burdening smaller projects and discouraging them from participating.
Finally, the proposal could ideally aim to quantify the success metrics a bit further. This exercise could be informed by lessons from the Uniswap grants program or from other more long-standing grant programs in the industry (e.g., Ethereum Foundation). Perhaps the program could even include incentives for the committee members that are tied to achieving certain metrics (though perhaps that’s better suited for a v2 of the program).
Overall, this looks like a great first step towards creating a COMP grants program. We look forward to hearing other feedback from the community.

FWIW I would be more concerned about the filtering bias than malicious behavior, but I’ve found a lot of the points on this thread pretty compelling. And actually, if a record of all the applications for grants are publicly visible, as well as all the decisions (i.e. if its totally transparent), I think it might work pretty well.",65,198.0,2021-03-03
['Compound Grants Program'],"While I believe that a Grants committee would be a new positive to the Compound ecosystem, I think there are a lot of issue which should be addressed with the current proposed program prior to initiating it.
Membership
Firstly, to echo Robert, I find the committee membership questionable. Some of members have never posted on these forums or in the Discord as far as I can tell, and I don’t believe that any member is familiar with the Compound protocol codebase.
While in a more broad grants committee this may not be problematic, the scope of the committee is defined as the Compound ecosystem. For such a scope, an intimate involvement within the community is a must for each member in my eyes. Also, having at least one person with a strong understanding of the Compound codebase is a must (I would recommend @adambavosa for this role).
Grant Process
There should be a more concrete process defined for the lead and reviewers to commit to follow. Under the current post, there doesn’t seem to be any actual rules by which the grants committee must follow—I don’t see how Governance can entrust $2M to a committee without any predefined process and rules to follow.
Building on the idea of processes, there should be an off-chain method for the community to vote on CGP related issues such as amendment to defined processes and changes to the committee.
Practicality
Something which should be considered is the practicality of distributing $1M per quarter on the Compound Ecosystem. Compared to the broad $750k of the Uniswap grants program, this is a very large influx of spending, which I’m not sure could be done effectively as of now. As one of the main active developers within the community, I think that $1M of spending per quarter within the ecosystem could cause chaos. I would rather see grants spending scale up to a sustainable amount.",64,232.8,2021-03-04
['Compound Grants Program'],"These are really good comments. Thanks @arr00! Responses below.

Firstly, to echo Robert, I find the committee membership questionable. Some of members have never posted on these forums or in the Discord as far as I can tell, and I don’t believe that any member is familiar with the Compound protocol codebase.

Since we posted the proposal, we’ve had a community member reach out and volunteer to join the committee. The company they work for does understand the Compound codebase, which should improve the committee’s grasp of the technical side of things. If you’re reading this, know Compound’s codebase, and want to join the committee too, please don’t hesitate to reach out! (I’m larry#7198 on Discord).
@adambavosa: if you’re interested in joining, let me know!
As far as some of the members not posting on forums/Discord goes — this is something we really went back and forth on. One question I have is should being an active community member be a prerequisite for being on this committee and potentially future grants committees? You can sort of argue both sides. On the one hand, active community members know what the treasury needs to provide funding for better than anyone. On the other hand, someone who is an active community member may not actually be good at running a grants program!
Then there’s this question: what does it mean to be an active community member? Is an investor who owns and thinks deeply about COMP but doesn’t have time to be part of the Discord / forums not an active community member? We certainly don’t have all the answers to these questions, but I think as a community, it’s worth thinking through them to set norms that define how future committees of this nature form.

There should be a more concrete process defined for the lead and reviewers to commit to follow

Absolutely. We didn’t post the process as part of the original proposal to keep it digestible (my sense is the longer it is, the fewer people read it in full). The original plan was to post the proposal, get community feedback, post it for an on-chain vote, and — if the proposal passes — to share a process grants applicants should expect to go through. But since you asked, here is the tentative process! It’s tentative because it hasn’t been tested in practice yet. I’m 100% sure parts of the process will change as we go about administering the program.
Grants Process

We want to make this a speedy process for applicants. Apart from the initial ramp-up period, we want to get the time from application submission to grant disbursement to 10 days or less (8 days for lead to review and 2 days for reviewers to vote and disburse the funds)
The lead will review every application and send an “approve” or “deny” decision along with a brief explanation to the reviewers. Reviewers are expected to review the lead’s email and reply with an “approve” or “deny” vote as per their independent judgement
Depending on the outcome of the reviewers’ vote, the grant will either be denied (no disbursement) or approved (grant is disbursed). If the grant is approved, reviewers should send it to the recipient no longer than 2 days after they first received the lead’s email
Multi-sig will require majority vote to pass (4/7 or more votes)


Building on the idea of processes, there should be an off-chain method for the community to vote on CGP related issues such as amendment to defined processes and changes to the committee.

That’s a great idea (I took note of it when you first mentioned it on the Clubhouse community call). We’ll work on setting up an off-chain vote for making small changes to the committee.

Something which should be considered is the practicality of distributing $1M per quarter on the Compound Ecosystem.

To your point, it’s hard to know how many applications we will receive before the fact. We may get $250k or $5mm worth of grant applications — the only way to find out is to launch the program and gather data! Our thinking was it’s better to play it safe than sorry: if $2mm is too much, we will simply return the funds to the treasury at the conclusion of the program. The outcome we wanted to avoid is we get something like $1.5mm in fantastic grant applications per quarter, which would require us to go through the governance process once more to ask the community for more funding. That would seriously slow the process down and make it less appealing to grants applicants.",58,81.6,2021-03-05

Proposal updates


Committee membership: to improve the technical sophistication of the committee, we’ve replaced Ken with Nick Cannon from Gauntlet. Gauntlet has successfully passed several technical updates to the protocol. The committee will benefit from having them onboard. We’ve also swapped in Min Teo from ConsenSys and Leighton Cusack from PoolTogether, who will be taking the place of Ryan and Sam (shout-out to @massnomis who posted the original idea for a grants committee). Playing committee Tetris wasn’t fun, but we think it was well-worth the effort — thanks to feedback from the community, the committee is way more well-balanced than before. The final committee will include:

Grants program amendments: during the community’s first Clubhouse call, @arr00 made a wonderful suggestion. If we need to make changes to the grants program after the proposal passes, it wouldn’t be practical to set up a formal governance proposal just for making small changes (e.g., swapping committee members around). Instead, @arr00 proposed the grants program set up a Snapshot page for the community to vote on amendments to the program. Setting up the Snapshot will require writing a bit of code (querying the amount of COMP delegated to addresses that vote). If the proposal passes, we will provide a grant to any community member who can help write this code and set up the Snapshot! While we’re on the topic of the grants program structure, we’d like to remind everyone that none of the grants program committee members are being elected into permanent roles. Once the pilot program wraps up in six months, the committee will be disbanded, allowing any community member(s) to set up a new committee with a fresh slate of members.


We will be posting the proposal on-chain tomorrow from Gauntlet’s address, 0x6626593c237f530d15ae9980a95ef938ac15c35c. Why are we using Gauntlet’s address?

The start of the conversation from Governor Bravo began in this post and has inspired some of the changes we’ve made so far. I’ll summarize the changes made along with their inspiration, and include a tentative timeline. Any feedback or recommendations for changes are greatly appreciated!

Upgradable Implementation - Like the Comptroller, Governance will now be upgradable to allow for incremental changes without breaking infrastructure built around it. The implementation is governed by Compound Governance.
Abstain option on voting - This allows for users to abstain to votes on chain. It is a necessary feature for a future project involving COMP staking.
Voting reason string - Users are able to send a string along with their vote explaining their voting reasoning. This is stored along with the vote receipt.
Settable governance parameters (voting period, voting delay, proposal threshold) - Having these fields be settable by governance allows for changes to the governance process without the requiring new contracts to be deployed.
Allowing proposer to cancel their own proposals - Currently, the only way for a proposal to be cancelled is for the proposer to lose delegations and fall below the proposal threshold. Allowing the proposer of the proposal to cancel their proposal at any point makes it possible for an erroneous proposal to be canceled if needed.
Removal of the Guardian - the guardian logic was used for the initial setup of Governance but is no longer needed. The logic around it has been removed.
Continuous Proposal Id Count - I have added logic to GovernorBravo which will set the initial proposal ID to the number after the final GovernorAlpha proposal ID.
Admin Logic - the settable parameters and implementation are governed by the admin, which will be set to the compound timelock.

We are approaching completion of the GovernorBravo implementation with the above features. Over the next few days we hope to complete testing and refactoring the code. After, we get the code audited which may take a while due to the current crypto environment.

With timelock option we will be able to filter real long-term believers and be able to predict moving “native” funds inside protocol
The governance system would be separated from the COMP market (long-term users who believe and want to work on the project would be separated from recursive farmers)
It would be clearer if the project is moving towards decentralized management (difficult to predict in the current situation) - it would be easier to control the evolution into a truly decentralized system

 dabar90:

However, I feel that the current utility of the COMP token is underutilized.


I would say utility of COMP token is intentionally crippled. Currently there are basically 2 things you can do with COMP tokens:


vote with it (which realistically just for fun and not impact anything unless your holdings count in thousands. And even then it’s not really impactful on results of voting)


You can use it as collateral. Which would really be enough as a major usecase unless it wouldn’t be kind of messed also:


a) By putting it as collateral you, for some weird reason, loosing your voting power, even if relatively small one.
b) You are forced to accept that your tokens might be lend, which you might not be fan of at all. And then you get arguments that: hey, they wanted to get some interest, so that’s a trade-off. Except there was no other choice to use it for collateral in other way.
Guess what, i’d say pretty much nobody with COMP holding in hundreds give a slightest care about that 5% or so of interest you might get at cCOMP market, because you can very well borrow some USDC or DAI and get interest in 20-30% APY on that relatively easily.
I’m not sure  there is that need of COMP borrowing market at all, as i read so many times concerns that “somebody could borrow COMP and somehow manipulate governance” Realistically i believe there are 2 major usecases for current COMP market:

recursive farming (if you were lucky to fit your borrow under CAP)
shorting COMP . If you are COMP stable coin farmer, that’s a great idea to sell your future distributions of COMP at high price (when it’s high) and repay it back with future distributions.

But again we can leave gimped cCOMP market as it is. Solution is actually quite simple, and don’t even require some impressive coding skills and just goes down to creating another cCOMP token. We can call it cCOMP2, or gCOMP (governance COMP) or wCOMP (wrapped COMP) or whatever else to separate it. And implement it with borrowing side disabled completely. Than we can have all the collateral usage, no borrowing side risks, no governance manipulation risks with borrowed tokens. And it can actually allow user to fully retain his voting power (that might need some coding though) as all tokens stay there in pool unless redeemed back. It even could be non-transferrable, like only be able to redeem it back for COMP, but not transfer from one address to another. That could very well be a defalt way of storing COMP tokens rather than quite costly one by keeping it in your address. (the cost here is opportunity cost, you lock away your capital in holding token which otherwise could be used in generating profits.)
And yeagh, i get it, COMP token is governance token, have no value. Except it’s not the case, it certanly DO have a market value.",38,42.6,2021-03-07

Actually, i have opportunity cost now in situation where I need to choose which utility to use. With given gas cost (waiting to accumulate amount of COMP) and voting significance ( illusion ) average user has nothing.
What the difference between staking and gComp pool?
And for lock away COMP vs generating profits - depend of user preference - so it’s subjective perspective.
I just want to say that maybe will be better have more choices when come to COMP utility. If you think that 5% is low then go to dapp interface and watch. I was just bring average staking number, read xy%.",37,12.4,2021-03-07

 dabar90:

What the difference between staking and gComp pool?


Staking usually bring zero value. Like you just send it to contract, contract lock it away and this is it. It’s a bit different, for example when you stake LP tokens, as then you providing liquidity and getting fees from pool.
Making another pool without borrowing is different, because you are actually using it as collateral. It is true for cCOMP pool also, but in cCOMP pool you lose control over your voting power, which is main purpose of having COMP to begin with. And you can’t really preserve your voting power in cCOMP pool for a reason it have borrowing side, thus amount of COMP in pool is able to fluctuate. But thing is, it came with a “packaged deal”, nobody asked Supplier if he want his COMP tokens be lend at all. Maybe his only interest was to use it as collateral (which is big deal by itself, given current valuation). That’s my point.
Surely, there are some users who want to lend their COMP. But i’m talking about much bigger userbase, who not interested in doing it at all. Quite opposite. They intend to hold it for extended period of time, and they want to use it for voting, and they want to use it as collateral. Pretty basic usecase imho.
When you use your assets as a collateral in a bank, you don’t expect or allow bank to lend it. And you don’t expect to lose your voting power either, in case if your assets are shares in some company. Why it’s different for COMP i have no idea.
So, Compound does not provide a very basic tool for COMP holders, yet so many complains are there that COMP have not much use case. And concerns about governance manipulation via borrowed COMP.",38,47.6,2021-03-08

Arr00 - Governor Bravo Update (starts at 1:25)

Arr00 shared an update on Governor Bravo, the new implementation of Compound governance that has been under development for several months and discussed at lengths in the forums. Bravo will improve upon the Governor Alpha by allowing the community to tweak individual governance parameters, like custom voting periods and delays. All the parameters on Bravo will begin the same so that the community can debate parameter changes on subsequent governance proposals. Additional improvements with Bravo include the ability to divide votes between different options, provide a rationale when casting a vote, the option to abstain from voting, and the ability for proposers to cancel their proposals. The code for Governor Bravo has been audited by Open Zeppelin, with the audit report publicly available here. Arr00 plans to create a CAP for Bravo by the end of the week, so consider delegating your support to it once it goes live. If you have built an integration to Governor Alpha, please also note that you can migrate to Bravo with this new ABI.

Yaron Velner - B.Protocol’s Compound Integration (starts at 11:13 )

Yaron Velner, CEO of B.Protocol, shared a demo of B.Protocol’s mainnet integration with Compound, which has $7M of assets locked since going live a week ago. B.Protocol allows suppliers and borrowers to interact with Compound through a proxy smart contract, and receive the same interest rates that they would from the underlying protocol. Liquidators on the B.Protocol network get a priority on liquidations from these users, by providing a cushion to at-risk borrowing positions and eventually sharing in the liquidation proceeds once the position exceeds the collateral factor. Liquidators receive more certainty  without competing on gas fees, users share in the liquidation rewards, and the Compound protocol benefits from a group of committed liquidators.

Larry Sukernik - Compound Grants Program (starts at 21:15)

Larry Sukernik shared an overview of the proposed Compound Grants Program, which seeks to provide a fast and efficient way for developers to get funding for projects that benefit the Compound ecosystem. Larry estimates that the grant application will take teams roughly 30 minutes to complete, and the Grants review team will target a 10 day window for approving/denying grant requests. The initial funding of ~$2M (5k COMP) for the Grants Program is actively being voted as Proposal 40 on in the governance system, so consider reading more about the program on the forum thread and casting your vote.

Adam Bavosa - Gateway Overview and Update (starts at 27:52)

Adam Bavosa, Developer Relations Lead at Compound Labs, provided a brief update on Gateway, a new substrate-based blockchain that allows for cross-chain interest rates markets. The Compound Labs team launched a testnet for Gateway last Monday, which is initially deployed with a single validator. Interested validators can set up session keys and listen to gossip from Gateway, in preparation for the next milestone that will allow multiple validators to participate in processing transactions. We also invite you to join the #Gateway channel in Discord, where Adam shares daily updates on what the Compound Labs team is working on, and members of the community share their feedback, bugs, and questions about the testnet.

['Compound Finance Community Calls'],"Every other Wednesday at 9:30 am PT there is a Compound Finance developer call in the Discord chat. That call is typically focused on development talk and not much else. A few days ago, the Blockchain at Berkeley club tweeted that Compound Finance should have a goverance/community call on Clubhouse.
I think it is a great idea to have a space to talk about Compound and governance regularly and try to grow the community further.
I propose hosting a biweekly Clubhouse call on the weeks there are not development calls. We all have a busy schedule, so I have posted a poll below to figure out what day works for most people. Once we pick a day (the poll lasts 1 week), I’ll add a new poll to pick a time. I think the best time would be Wednesday late-afternoon PT, so people associate Wednesday with Compound Finance and the evening so people who can’t participate in the morning development call have an opportunity to participate.
Please vote for the days that work for you. Multiple votes are encouraged.

The goal of testnet is to break things and fix things, and not necessarily in that order. We encourage feedback at all levels, as the ultimate goal is to build an amazing product that will delight users. Over the next few weeks, you’ll see lots of upgrades to the user interface, documentation fleshed out, and upgrades to the gateway chain and contracts themselves. We’ll continue testing system functionalities (such as adding authorities, changing parameters, performing chain upgrades), attempting to make the system unavailable (DoS), and otherwise wreaking havoc.
All this means that testnet will take time to stabilize. If you’re reading this, we assume you’re here because you want to use, build with, or learn about the system anyway, and don’t mind being in the middle of an active construction zone.
For developers, a good place to get an overview of functionality is the Gateway documentation. To understand precisely what the system is doing, there’s no place better to look than the source code, this is where all active development happens.
For those interested in being validators, we’ve created a Validator Guide. This will be a living document that will evolve with testnet over the course of the next several weeks. It’s important to keep in mind that how Proof of Staking will work is still TBD, and for now our team’s focus is on iterating and proving the core product.
For anyone looking to build a starport on another chain, we’ll have more information on this topic in the near future. In the meantime, what chain do you want to build on? Have you looked at the Ethereum contracts yet?

Should we consider adding certain Uniswap LP tokens as collateral assets?
I think it would make sense to support any pair that comprise two assets already usable as collateral on Compound:

WBTC / ETH

USDC / ETH

In term of collateral factor, I would suggest a 50/50 blended average based on the collateral factor of each underlying token. I would also understand if people argue that the collateral factor should be lower to account for the added risk of having exposure to the Uniswap V2 smart contract.

Gauntlet - Autogov Dashboard (starts at 2:55)

The Gauntlet Team presented a beta version of their Autogov dashboard, which evaluates system wide and individual market risk for the Compound protocol. Each market is given a collateral safety score of low, medium, or high based on the daily simulations that Gauntlet runs. As described in the accompanying forum post, the main inputs for the safety score are the average volatility, liquidity ratio, and average collateralization ratio of the market. Borrowers on Compound can use this dashboard as a helpful tool to see which assets are the safest collateral types, and which assets are likely to be de-risked by the community with a collateral factor decrease. The Gauntlet team is actively looking for community feedback on the dashboard ahead of a v1 launch, so reach out to @Tarun or @jmo on Discord.

Getty Hill & Sorawit Suriyakarn - Price Feed Medianizer (starts at 16:42)

Sorawit Suriyakarn, CTO of Band Protocol, walked the community through the code for a weighted median price oracle that the Band team has been building. The medianizer allows Compound governance to choose a set of reporters as the data source for asset prices, where the reporters could include centralized exchanges, on-chain decentralized exchanges, on-chain oracle networks, or reputable independent reports. Governance will have the ability to set the weight for each of these reporters with a setWeight function, and a price function will return the medianized price based on those weights. The current implementation of the medianizer supports data from the Open Price Feed, Chainlink, Band Protocol, and Keep3r. The Band team is preparing for a governance proposal after a community review, so reach out to @swit or @Paul_BAND with any feedback on the medianizer, or post your comments on the accompanying forum post.

Torrey Atcitty - Compound Chain Preview (starts at 32:50)

Torrey Atcitty, Application Lead at Compound Labs, shared a demo of Compound Chain, which is currently in an internal alpha stage. During the demo, Torrey showed the front end interface that contains sections for collateral assets, credit assets, and a connected MetaMask account. Torrey uploaded 50k of ZRX from the Ethereum Starport to Compound Chain, which provided him a Limit Multiplier to incur a credit balance, similar to collateral factors in Compound v2. Once the ZRX was successfully uploaded to Compound Chain, Torrey began earning interest in the form of CASH, the native unit of account on the network that is also used to pay transaction fees. Using the ZRX in Compound Chain as collateral, Torrey then downloaded USDC to his MetaMask wallet on Ethereum and the interface updated to show a negative credit balance of USDC that Torrey owes back to the protocol. Torrey also showed the ability to directly download CASH to any connected starport that supports it, which in this case was Ethereum. Lastly, Torrey executed a transfer of COMP on Compound Chain without ever owning the asset (by incurring a negative credit balance of COMP) and without paying any Ethereum gas fees. We encourage the community to ask any questions and provide feedback on Compound Chain in the #Development Discord channel, and look forward to sharing a testnet and documentation in the near future.

['Building a medianizer'],"Compound NEEDS to improve the current oracle infrastructure as a matter of safety and growth. I think it is evident to users that the current solution is not ideal and not close to ideal. The event that occurred in November with Dai liquidations was preventable. Little has been done to prevent the situation from happening again with Dai or any other markets. In addition to preventing the November event from transpiring again, I think it is also in the protocol’s best interest to improve the oracle situation so Compound can safely support more assets.
Based on the conversation that has been had on the forum and Discord, the community is uncertain what the next steps are to improving the situation. I have seen discussion of adding Chainlink as an oracle provider, Makerdao’s oracle, additional exchanges, and decentralized exchanges as price feeds. There is no consensus on what is to be trusted.
While I am confident in using Compound and store assets on the platform, I think the protocol would greatly benefit from investing in better oracle infrastructure in the long-run. While the Open Price Feed built by the Compound team does a good job getting prices from exchanges onto the blockchain, it has no logic to average the prices or weight them by significance. We are fortunate enough to have many high-quality exchanges, both on and off-chain, that we should be utilizing.
I think the best next step is to build a medianizer (following Makerdao’s lead) that can handle multiple price feeds. To make the task less daunting, I suggest the first implementation tries to utilize Coinbase Pro, Okex, and Uniswap prices. The medianzier will need to consider when the last price of each of these sources is made so that it omits stale prices. The solution should also allow more price feeds to be added on at a later date.
Unfortunately, I lack the skills (learning) necessary to build this idea, but the community will likely reward who is ever successful if someone/group were to build it. Although I lack the technical skills, I know a good amount about incentives, liquidations, and exchanges, and I am willing to lend a hand in any way I can to make this improvement happen. I will also send personally $5k of COMP token to whoever successfully implements this, and if you are unsuccessful but can get to a full proposal, I will send $1k of COMP.
All questions, comments, and concerns are welcomed and encouraged. If you are an individual who is interested in building this and are unsure if the protocol will compensate and how much they might compensate you, please post those questions here and DM me if you want more certainty.

Why not let the community decide what source (on chain) they consider trustworthy and which correlation factor they consider safe. Best example was the Dai case. A value that high above average source at the time and over time should have been correlated as a rejected value. Especially for Dai. I’m not expecting it to change that much so it should have a low factor.
The sources can be updated over time if one becomes untrusted by the community. Or new feeds are born and approved.
This would cover the reading part at no cost.

['Setup cCOMP voting'],"Similar to the proposal on setting up cUNI voting, it’d be interesting to get the community’s take on enabling a multi-sig setup for enabling COMP lenders to vote on governance proposals.
One of the things that we’d always like to see is an enhanced representation of different voting interests for topics under deliberation for Compound; but one of the segments that we seem to be cutting out is the community of COMP holders who are actively lending out their COMP to the protocol. As it is structured, COMP is meant to be a token representing governance - and not something that (yet) is representative of value/claims on the underlying reserves. The market liquidity of COMP is about 2.2% of the circulating supply - which is not insignificant in terms of the weight it could add to votes. To this extent, shouldn’t we be enabling such lenders the capability to also add their voice to discussions and their vote towards the same?
Similar to what @arr00 proposed, it could be good to delegate the weight of these votes to the community multi-sig, which could potentially monitor the net COMP in the protocol (lent - borrowed) + the reserves for a period of a week prior to the vote & combine that to a net representation of ayes and nays from voters (weighted by the amount of cCOMP in wallets). Might even be possible to add a discount factor to the resulting vote given that ownership of underlying COMP assets is somewhat dissociated from the owners - but that is something I’d love to hear people’s feedback on as well.

['Improving Liquidation'],"Problem
The Comptroller contract stores a Liquidation Incentive parameter, which is currently 8%. This incentive is used to entice liquidators to perform liquidations.
Lately, “predatory” liquidators have begun burning the liquidation incentive in gas fees, earning no profit for themselves, and transferring all profit to miners (MEV).

Example 1
Example 2

While this is effective at de-risking the protocol (in the short-term), it is driving community liquidators out of business. The quantity, and diversification of liquidators is what provides safety for the Compound protocol. If the predatory liquidators are successful at discouraging community liquidators, the health of the protocol will be jeopardized.
Improvements to the liquidation process are needed.
Possible Solution
The liquidation incentive can be split between the liquidator (5%), and the protocol reserves (3%). This brings multiple advantages:

Regardless of whether the liquidator is friendly or predatory, the liquidation increases reserves, which benefits the users (safety), and COMP token-holders
Cascading liquidations pose less of a risk to the protocol; each liquidation increases the cushion for the next liquidation
The threshold at which the protocol suffers insolvency from a single address improves by 3%. This is because the “break-even” health of a user is ~ (Collateral Factor + Liquidation Incentive); the larger the liquidation incentive, the less collateral available to protect the protocol

Second, the gas costs of liquidations can be optimized; reducing the gas required to liquidate, and limiting gas battles – which will benefit community liquidators.
Trade-offs / Risks
Decreasing the liquidator incentive to 5% may reduce willingness to liquidate.
Counter-argument: prior to the cascading liquidation / sell-off in March 2020, the Liquidation Incentive parameter was set to 5%; this was sufficient to always incentivize liquidation on a first-come first served basis. It was raised to 8% out of precaution (during an extremely volatile week).
Potential Improvements
cToken
[core] In seizeInternal(), transfer 97% of the seizetokens to the liquidator, and 3% of the seizetokens to the Comptroller

Store a third balance in memory for ComptrollerTokensNew
Emit event for second transfer (to Comptroller)
Note: this math would actually be 3.24% incentive going to the protocol, 4.76% to the liquidator (based on math!), which is OK - you could also calculate the right ratio

[optional] Liquidation gas optimizations
The cToken and Comptroller have myriad opportunities for small iterative improvements to gas cost, including graceful failure info, duplicated checks (e.g. for freshness, borrower=liquidator), etc. There may or may not be low-hanging fruit.
Comptroller
[optional] In liquidateBorrowAllowed(), require that tx.gasprice is below an arbitrarily (yet reasonable) threshold, e.g. 2,000 gwei; this would limit gas-racing to MEV
[optional] In liquidateBorrowAllowed(), only check the closeFactor for borrow balances over $100,000; this would allow fully closing small borrowing positions, which is more gas optimal
Deployment / Rollout
The core incentive changes would be at a cToken level, and would only apply to upgradable (2nd generation) cTokens, including DAI, USDT, UNI, and COMP, which would be upgraded through a governance proposal.
The major collateral markets, ETH & WBTC, would have to migrate to upgradable cTokens - which is a long-standing goal - for which these liquidation improvements are a good catalyst.
Future Improvements

Dynamically weight the incentive between liquidator and protocol; accounts that are deeply unprofitable could carry a larger weighting towards the liquidator (e.g. 8%), incentivizing the closure of the most at-risk accounts first.
Adjust the incentive based on a function of time (similar to an auction model)

 rleshner:

The liquidation incentive can be split between the liquidator (5%), and the protocol reserves (3%).


I think the major disadvantage to this policy is that at minimum it creates the perception of misaligned incentives and may indeed created misaligned incentives.
Think about all of the complaints about BitMEX profiteering from MEX liquidations. Even if there is no concrete evidence of bad behavior, at the very least, it creates the perception that the protocol might care a little less about liquidated borrowers, and might do a little less to ensure that liquidations are handled “above board”. I’d fear that the Compound brand would suffer as a result.",49,84.8,2021-02-10
['Improving Liquidation'],"By my understanding the issue with bitmex was the platform itself (supposedly) using proprietary information to hunt for liquidations and stops and then profit through the insurance fund, but this shouldn’t apply for on chain lending where positions are visible to everyone on an equal basis.
Liquidation fees are a simple and coherent way to charge riskier users more than safe users.",46,84.2,2021-02-10
['Improving Liquidation'],"Percentage
Reserving a portion of the liquidation fees into the contract makes sense to me. Cascading liquidations are indeed a concern.
However, I don’t see how changing these percentages alters the balance between MEV liquidators and non-MEV liquidators. In either case there is a fixed amount of profit to be had for the liquidator, and some portion of that potential profit must be spent for gas. Simply reducing the maximum profit available will not make it any less favorable to MEV liquidate. Right?
Gas Limits
I’m strongly opposed to a gas limit however. If my understanding is correct, Compound’s  liquidations only function correctly inside a band of prices. If the securing asset price has gone too low, or the borrowed asset price has gone too high, then it no longer makes financial sense to liquidate. It is essential that liquidation happen quickly when inside the band. In a case when Compound would be in most danger, with insane price moves on major assets, it is almost certain that gas prices would rise to astronomical levels as every trader franticly attempts to avoid losses, or  to profit from the changes. This would be the worst possible time to lock out liquidations.",44,13.8,2021-02-10
['Improving Liquidation'],"The current issue comes from the ability to be able post price by anyone, liquidators include the prices in the transactions where they liquidate and the gas price race is unlimited to the edge where there is no profit.
Explaining the situation on the previous oracle when Compound Labs was posting the prices to the oracle:
in this case the liquidator wanted to be in the same block where the oracle update tx was and the liquiadtion tx was limited by the gas price of the posted price tx gas price, so there was no gas price race in this case, and the winner was “random” accordig to how the transactions was indexed in the block cause they was all at the same gas price.
I could see a potential fix of burning the profit in gas by disallowing calling the oracle update function from contracts meaning it would be forced to be a seperate transaction, and the liquidations could be limited again by the oracle update transaction gas price.
The incentive for the liquidator to update the oracle in this case is till there.",39,87.8,2021-02-10
['Improving Liquidation'],"Absolutely fascinating issue.
The problem with a gas limit is that in a liquidity crunch like in march, gas prices could go through the roof.
Maybe having maximum gas as a function of a moving average of gas prices. i.e. 5x current gas prices?
Front running in Ethereum is a noted issue.
Not sure if it will ever go away, maybe community liquidators are gone forever.

this will not necessarily decrease the MEV, as it will give rise to spam txs, namely, instead of broadcasting a single tx with high gas price, bots will send many txs with lower gas price.
Such behavior was observed when dydx price feed was back running friendly (as opposed to front running).



 rleshner:

transfer 97% of the seizetokens to the liquidator, and 3% of the seizetokens to the Comptroller


Imo here it is very important to define what is it Compound is trying to solve.
For example I think this would help a lot towards mitigating black thursday like events, where liquidations completely failed, as it will allow the COMP dao to use the accumulated fees are an insurance fund.
But will be less efficient if the future is to increase the collateral factor over time, and reducing the liquidation incentives will inevitably lead to less efficient liquidation process. And the community will probably be reluctant to use the insurance funds on a day to day basis.

New incentives, developer grants (and bounties for completed work), reducing risk (converting the treasury into each supported asset), education, marketing, hiring staff / members of the community - and all creative ideas are feasible. It’s now up to the community to deploy these ample resources. And with the introduction of Autonomous Proposals, participating is easier than ever.
If you have free time, Solidity knowledge, or any other skills that you can use to improve Compound–take this as a call to action to get involved. Here are a few of the ideas and challenges that I think are worth tackling, and worth rewarding:
New Markets
The protocol can support any market with a reliable price feed; currently, the Open Price Feed supports a subset of Coinbase Pro assets, including ones that haven’t been added to Compound yet (KNC, LINK, COMP).
Every market added to Compound increases its utility - and the community should never stop evaluating opportunities to safely expand markets.
L1 Gas Optimizations
Over the past few months, Ethereum has become slow and expensive to use–and many aspects of the protocol were designed in a low-cost era. While there’s no silver bullet, shaving off gas costs will have a direct benefit for every user and application. Potential improvements include:


Optimizing the cToken contract (and deploying a new implementation for upgradable cTokens, including DAI and USDT).
Removing the automatic distribution of COMP (which adds gas to every user action), and fall back to deliberately claiming COMP.
Reverting cDAI to no longer sweep DAI into the Dai Savings Rate (which has been 0% for quite some time).
In-lining the interest rate models into the upgradable cTokens.

Economic Optimizations
The economic competitiveness of the protocol is the foundation for everything else the community builds upon.

Standardize collateral factors for stablecoins and collateral assets.
With WBTC liquidity rapidly scaling, and following a 0-incident pilot, raise the collateral factor to mirror other high-quality assets like ETH.
Implement borrowing caps for collateral assets, limiting risk for suppliers of those assets.

COMP Distribution
The distribution of COMP is central to bring new users, voices, and participation into the protocol and it’s governance.

Add a function to the Comptroller to manually distribute COMP to approved recipients; this could be used for grants, or new distribution mechanisms.
Add vesting for the COMP Distribution, discouraging speculators and increasing the amount of COMP available to organic users of the protocol.
Improve the COMP Distribution mechanic, to allow Governance to granularly set the COMP Distribution speeds by market–allowing a more customized set of incentives.
Distribute COMP retroactively to early users of the protocol.
Increase the distribution of COMP to developers that build value-add products on top of the protocol.

Governance

The community, for the most part, has relied on ad-hoc governance. A member of the community could become a part-time (or full-time) coordinator, to organize governance calls, development efforts, and community engagement.
New tooling (like comp.vote in the works) can expand participation in new ways.

There’s a lot of opportunities to participate - and the community will help you succeed. ",87,2172.4,2020-09-18
['A Call to Action'],Will removing the automatic distribution model decrease the gas fess associated with reverting to deliberately having to claim Comp Token? Will there be initial gas price increase due to the upgrade to the cToken model optimization?

['A Call to Action'],"A thought I had, though how feasible it is I’m not sure, was around liquidations. To encourage participation in governance - potentially using a pre-set timelocked amount of COMP to qualify someone for “premium” liquidation status could help drive down bots and open up liquidations to everyday users.
Assuming we built a better in-app liquidation tool - this could provide internal policing for members of the community - who then benefit from being able to participate in liquidation - versus outside bots. I think it would drive value to both COMP and the community at large and make liquidations more fair for those who’d like to participate.",68,33.6,2020-09-20

Compound Developer Community Call Notes
Wednesday, January 27, 2021


Peteris Erins shared an update on Gauntlet’s implementation of COMP vesting, which is currently being audited by Quantstamp. The latest implementation modifies the claimComp function to include the cooldown mechanism, instead of creating a new cooldown function and changing the API. Calling the claimComp function will automatically trigger a cooldown period for any accrued COMP, with the duration specified by governance. The Gauntlet team welcomes the community to provide feedback in the accompanying forum post and review the code in the pull request.


Yaron Velner provided an update on B.Protocol, a liquidation layer that sits on top of interest rate protocols like Compound and incentivizes a group of permanent liquidators to share guaranteed liquidations, as opposed to an ecosystem of liquidators who compete on high gas prices to gain an advantage. In this system, liquidators are able to provide cushion to an at-risk borrowing position, which gives them a priority on the position. When the borrowing position exceeds the specified collateral factor, B.Protocol liquidators that provided cushion can liquidate an equal share of the assets. This ‘fairness mechanism’ is described in more detail in B.Protocol’s most recent blog post, a slide deck shared during the call, and a forum post from November. B.protocol currently has a live integration with MakerDao and plans to go to mainnet with a Compound integration in February.


Getty Hill shared an idea for a medianizer that would aggregate prices from a variety of onchain and offchain sources, similar to what MakerDao uses. Getty notes that Coinbase being the only reporter in the Open Price Feed presents security concerns and limits the number of assets that the protocol can support. Paul Nattapatsiri, the CPO of Band Protocol, chimed in that his team would be excited to build the medianizer, as well as propose Band Protocol’s oracle system being added as a reporter to the OPF. Paul thinks that he will likely be able to share Band’s implementation of the medianizer on the next Community Developer Call, so stay tuned for any updates in the next couple of weeks. You can read more about the proposed medianizer in the forum post, and feel free to provide feedback on a price oracle that will hopefully benefit the entire DeFi ecosystem.

['Risk Parameter Update - February 2021'],"After the healthy discussion over the past week or so about the WBTC collateralFactor changes, people mentioned a few key risk factors:

Liquidity
Volatility
User behavior (for example, the collateral ratios maintained by borrowers)

Over the past few months we’ve seen liquidity improve for many tokens in Compound, while volatility has also increased substantially. How do you determine if the increase in volatility is offset by the increase in liquidity? How have user-chosen collateral ratios affected any added risk? These factors interact in complex ways, and we believe the only way to understand how these myriad conditions affect risk is by running stress tests for the protocol.
We’ve gone ahead and run a set of stress tests of Compound to try to set collateralFactors that better balance the risk and capital efficiency of the protocol. We’re looking forward to doing this more frequently going forward. By setting parameters more frequently, the protocol should be able to take on more risk as we will be standing by to increase collateral requirements as market conditions change. We’ll submit a proposal for these parameters early next week, but want to leave this on the forum for a bit to get more feedback in the meantime.
Proposed Collateral Factors





Current
Recommended




DAI
75%
80%


USDC
75%
80%


BAT
60%
65%


COMP
60%

ETH
75%
75%


UNI
60%
60%


WBTC
75%
60%


ZRX
60%
65%



As we mentioned in the discussions around the WBTC collateralFactor, WBTC poses the largest risk to the protocol and collateral requirements should be increased. However, as the community just voted to change this, we’ll leave this parameter out this proposal, and include it in the next one. We’ll also be making some changes to COMP speed, as these collateralFactor changes could encourage more circular borrowing in the protocol:





Current COMP Speed (COMP/block)
Recommended COMP Speed




DAI
0.067
0.050


USDC
0.067
0.050



Stress Test Results
Our stress tests are described here, but to recap they:

Deploy the Compound contracts in a test environment
Subsample the current distribution of borrowers to create a representative set in the test environment
Add synthetic price trajectories for each asset that are modelled from historical market data
As the prices change, positions become eligible for liquidation, and agents in the test liquidate the collateral on Compound via a slippage curve fit to real data from centralized and decentralized exchanges
Run simulations comprising 1-4 hundreds of times to predict potential insolvencies in Compound

We’ll focus on the main output of the simulations, which is “Net Insolvent Value” per collateral type. This is highly dependent on price volatility, which we vary across the x-axis below. A “Volatility Scalar” of 1 means that the stress tests used price paths that matched the historical volatility of each asset, a scalar of 8 corresponds to price paths that are 8 times as volatile as recent asset prices. For reference, the historically bad volatility of March 12/13, 2020 corresponds to a scalar of 7 or 8.
1600×1458 81.4 KB
ZRX, DAI, USDC, and BAT have a very low risk of seeing insolvency, even under March 12 like conditions. We’ll recommend increasing the collateralFactor (and lowering the collateral requirements for borrowers) for those assets.*
ETH, COMP and UNI also carry risk, but after investigating further, that risk was mostly determined by the accounts relying on WBTC as collateral as well, so we’ll recommend those parameters remain unchanged. Accounts using multiple collateral types can create complications in data analysis, but we look at individual accounts to add color to the data.
*One thing to note. The issues that were seen with DAI price fluctuations late last year are still possible. Borrowers using DAI as collateral or borrowing DAI should be careful when approaching the collateral limits.",67,2488.4,2021-02-06
['Risk Parameter Update - February 2021'],"I very much dislike a concept of packaged deals, as this is very common way of manipulations. Change for collateral factors and change of COMP distribution speeds are different parameters and shouldn’t be packaged together inside one proposal. But rather voted separately, presenting voters opportunity to express their opinion on each change separately.
Decreasing distribution initiatives to DAI and USDC will indeed likely to decrease recursive stable coin farming, but i think it deserves bigger discussion. Certanly even after previous adjustment stable coin markets are kind of overincentivised, but such big of a cut is unjustified in my opinion. I suggest we proceed slowly and observe results. Instead of cutting it in 20% in one move by going from 0.067 to 0.050 we should consider gradual decrease instead and observe impact on markets. And maybe return to that discussion next month, when we have data on results.
On the other hand, collateral markets are kind of underincentivised still, WBTC and ETH certanly could get more initiative. Previous adjustment sparked some interest in Borrowing side, which, in turn, moved supply interest into something more noticeble than zero. Currently, Borrow side of Collateral markets can boast sligtly negative interest on Borrowing of ETH and WBTC. Which is justifiable, as with current bullish expectations, going short feels a risky position for most. And yet, Borrow side of that markets is important for Compound, not only it generates Reserves for that markets, but it also provides interest for Supply side. As well as provide more balanced utilization. If we add to ETH and WBTC what we substract from DAI and USDC, not only it might help to adjust risk, borrowers are taking, but it will also likely move APY on supply side to higher numbers, bringing more liquidity for protocol. There’s also some concerns that together with big increases in valuation of ETH and WBTC we might observe actual decrease of WBTC and ETH, supplied to protocol, COMP distributions could help here too.
So on topic of COMP speed, i’d suggest consider something like that:
DAI         0.067        decrease  to      0.062
USDC     0.067        decrease  to      0.062
WBTC     0.01075    increase   to      0.01575
ETH        0.01075    increase    to      0.01575
While incentives on stable coins are likely could be cut more,  i don’t think incentives for WBTC and ETH should be increased in bigger steps. Predictable distributions is strong feature of Compound protocol. And i think making small incremental adjustments on the way would bring protocol much further in the end.
Decreasing total COMP emissions per day i believe is completely different topic. And should be discussed further. Recent surge in COMP price, while brought a lot of excitement not necessarily is here to stay and not nesessarily a call for fast action.
I’m not quite convinced that both increasing of collateral factors for stable coins and WBTC collateral factor increase are coming at good time, as markets look quite overheated. At the same time i’m not convinced that WBTC liquidations is that big of a problem. ETH/WBTC pair on Sushiswap alone is over 700m of liquidity and another 300m liquidity is at Uniswap. I wasn’t a supporter of WBTC Collateral factor increase, but i wasn’t against it either.",62,172.4,2021-02-08

 Sirokko:

agree, since ETH staking and very low interest rate on supply, the incentive to supply ETH needs to be strengthened. In addition to a more drastic increase in interest rates, higher COMP distribution on ETH supply is a good idea. Are there any other options?",57,11.4,2021-02-08

['Risk Parameter Update - February 2021'],"It is not really our intention to create a package deal, merely to change the protocol in a way that is more or less neutral to existing rewards .
Currently there is a lot of recursive borrowing in Compound that provides little value to the protocol. Recursive borrowers will for instance post DAI collateral, and then borrow USDC, having a position that is paying interest to Compound in return for liquidity mining rewards. With the current collateralFactor (cf) of .75, this means that farmers will earn COMP commensurate to 1.75x of their funds deposited. Farmers often leverage multiple times when doing this, in this case they would then borrow 75 DAI against every $100 of borrowed USDC, and so on.





Action
Current Reward




1
Deposit 1000 DAI as collateral
1000 * 0.067 COMP / Block


2
Borrow 750 USDC
750 * 0.067 COMP / Block


3
Deposit 750 USDC
750 * 0.067 COMP / Block


4
Borrow (.75 * 750 DAI =) 562.5 USDC
562.5 USDC * 0.067 COMP / Block


5
Deposit 562.5 USDC
562.5 USDC * 0.067 COMP / Block



…
…



You can quickly imagine that you can keep doing this over and over again to achieve farming rewards equal to L:
L = 1 + 2(cf) + 2(cf)^2 … (cf)^n
As
𝚺(cf^n), from n=0 to inf. =  1 + (cf) + (cf)^2 … (cf)^n
And when cf < 1:
𝚺(cf^n), from n=0 to inf. =  1 / (1-cf)
we have that L approaches the following as the number of recursive borrows increases:
L = 2 / (1-cf) - 1
Given cfs of .75 and .8, the maximum leverage is:
L(0.75) = 7
L(0.8)  = 9
This means that if the cf is increased, the maximum leverage (and therefore farming reward) is now ~29% higher than before. Now we want changes to risk to be neutral towards rewards. This would imply a reduction of COMP rewards commensurate to the maximum leverage the cf enables.
With current COMP speeds of .067 COMP / block for DAI and USDC, lowering rewards ~25% to .050 COMP / block should offset the increased farming rewards. Given that people are not recursively borrowing a literally infinite amount of times, we rounded up a bit.
Now, as you notice, just lowering the rewards in one market is not risk neutral. The problem is that we’ve seen these rewards greatly encourage borrowing across specific collateral types, and so we’re hesitant to further encourage something like WBTC collateral, which we believe poses a systemic risk. Then that leaves other markets like ZRX and BAT, but which are also receiving needed cf updates.
We’re happy to entertain any separate proposals for how to further distribute COMP, but right now, we’re making the changes we feel best balance the interests of the protocol users, COMP holders, and community members. The changes are made with the broad brush strokes provided to us by Compound governance. We try to make the proposal as targeted as possible, and try to avoid omnibus proposals that needlessly couple unrelated changes. However in Compound, risk is tightly coupled to reward, and we are doing our best to change one with minimal impact on the other.",53,95.6,2021-02-08
['Risk Parameter Update - February 2021'],"It’s good argument, that intention is merely to change protocol in a way, which is neutral to existing rewards. I’l take it for now. But keeping that in mind, let’s look at what you propose from broader perspective.
First of all, we all agree that there is quite a position of recursive borrowing, which debatefully not that much valuable to protocol. I believe that is a bit more complex, but i think we could agree that it’s surely not THAT valuable, considering share of COMP distribution that strategy recieves. Currently stable coin markets recieve over 70% of COMP distribution, while all others combined get less than 30%. And that is while stable coins are less than half of supply, but majority of borrow side. Additionaly good share of stable coin markets is represented by recursive borrowing.
I don’t see recursive borrowing as plain evil though. Yes, it wasn’t intended, but it’s still legit usage of protocol. It drives adoption and brings liquidity at the very least.
I’ve read Gauntlet research paper and i understand your position that Compound protocol can handle increasing collateral factor for USDC and DAI market. But while it doesn’t create sistematic risk for protocol, it allows users to take more risk.
And that is coming not at exactly calmest period for cryptocurrency markets. That is what i mean when saying that it’s potentially not the best time to allow users to take more risk.
But then who is main beneficiary of increased collateral for stable coins? COMP farmers, utilising stable coin strategies. We can pretty much safely assume that, as we do not see that stable coins are used for collateral to borrow volatile assets like ETH, or WBTC or others. Stable coin borrowing absolutely dwarfs everything else. Increasing CF for USDC and DAI is basically adding more initiative to recursive farming, like it wasn’t big enough already.
So point one: While Compound protocol could safely handle bigger CF for DAI and USDC markets should collateral factor be increased at that markets conditions, while main benefeciary of such move indeed would be recursive COMP farmers?
If we agree, that recursive farming isn’t that valuable, why push initiative basically promoting to use it more? USDC-USDC and DAI-DAI are most safe strategies who can easily take more risk from increased CF. USDC-DAI and DAI-USDC are less so due to
potential DAI volatility, but still it’s nowhere near comparable to volatile assets.
Now lets come back to your suggested solution for that.
It’s hard to estimate exact share of recursive borrowing in stable coins, as users can easily use multiply addresses, but just for a sake of simplicity let’s take it’s 60%. Like 60% of stable coin markets consists from recursive borrowing. That number doesn’t need to be accurate for purpose of that discussion, just for pure simplicity.
Then you say if we increase CF, than those participants, can safely increase their leverage and potentially could get up to 29% more in COMP rewards for their capital invested. That if all of them do that, which might or might not happen. But then
where do that bigger rewards coming from? Is protocol paying more? Nope, protocol distribute exactly same amounts. Ok, so bigger rewards for recursive farmers coming because they increase their share in stable coins markets. So basically, having
same capital invested, they will potentially be able to increase their share in USDC and DAI markets and thus dilute share of other 40% participants which utilise other strategies. So they will get more per capital, than pure non-recursive usage like
Supply ETH - borrow USDC for example. But that is worst-case a potential outcome. So, potentially, 40% of non-recursive part of stable coin markets would get less of COMP distribution than before, which at maximum might be up to 29% less.
And then your suggested solution is to cut COMP distribution to USDC and DAI markets, which guarantee decrease of 25% in rewards for every participant of USDC and DAI markets, unless you are specifically a recursive farmer, in which case you can make it up for yourself by doing more leverage and then your rewards per capital invested will stay same.
So the only loosers here are users, who are not recursive-farmers. Also such change imply that we actually decreasing total COMP distribution per day. As we decrease distribution speed for USDC and DAI markets and not putting that distribution anywhere else. This is certanly not neutral change to existing rewards.
I’d say in that case the treatment is worse than desease. Not only we introduce CF change wich directly benefit specific strategy, but we go further, and then cut rewards for everybody else, who isn’t using that strategy. I wonder how that go well with statement that recursive farming isn’t that much valuable for protocol. Why then we introduce initiatives stimulating that activity.
I would say if we go with increasing CF fo USDC and DAI we should let market decide about decreasing/increasing rewards proportions between recursive/pure borrowing. And not instead execute literally the worst possible outcome for other non-recursive users.
I have no comments on your proposed CF on ZRX and BAT markets, these are relatively small markets and proposed change is rather conservative as well. I don’t see problems with that change for now.
And on topic of decreasing recursive borrowing my position is same. I believe we should allocate bigger portion to other markets. In current conditions Collateral markets (WBTC, ETH) at the expense of USDC, DAI markets. Decreasing distribution on stable coins always should have decreasing effect on recursive borrowing as you only can leverage till it’s profitable enough, lower rewards lead to less sustainable leverage. Increasing rewards to Collateral markets at same time lead to bigger utilisation and make other patterns of usage of Compound more rewarding as well, even if slightly.
In the end, i would like to mention that i absolutely like job, Gauntlet is doing for Compound protocol, as well as involvment with community. But i believe this particular changes as they just were drafted certanly need considerations.",50,80.0,2021-02-09

That’s not true. Raising collateral factor for USDC and DAI benefits exclusevly specific portion of users who use USDC and/or DAI as collateral. And since 80% of borrowing side consists of stable coins, we can safely assume that primary beneficiaries are recursive farmers. (since if you using stable coin collateral most likely you still borrow stable coins with it, and that have no economic sense aside of COMP farming) How raising collateral for USDC and DAI should help a user, who isn’t using DAI or USDC as collateral? For example, users, who supply ETH or WBTC and borrow USDC or DAI? Maybe i’m missing something here?
Decreasing distribution speeds of COMP for DAI and USDC markets, decrease rewards for ALL users of stable coins markets on the other hand.
And that was the main thing i wanted to highlight in my previous post.",40,48.0,2021-02-09
['Risk Parameter Update - February 2021'],"I want to preface my comments that I wish I had more time to do a thoughtful, independent analysis of each asset.
TLDR: I would vote no on this proposal if it were made as is.
Why:


I don’t like package deals. If you want to adjust multiple collateral factors at once, I think it is possible (unlikely) to do that. If you want to change multiple comp speed variables at once, I think it is possible (likely) to do that. Adjust multiple collateral factors and comp speeds in the same proposal is setting a bad precedent. If you had ample evidence for these changes, perhaps I would change my mind.


I don’t see a reason detailed in this proposal to decrease the comp speed for Dai and USDC.





 jmo:

We’ll also be making some changes to COMP speed, as these collateralFactor changes could encourage more circular borrowing in the protocol:


Perhaps you meant to say discourage? Either way, I disagree.


I read through your February Market Risk Assessment. While the document is very well written and the first  14 pages do a great job outlining the protocol, I do not think the paper’s evidence is sufficient for justifying these collateral changes. While I am generally a proponent for increasing the collateral factors, I also believe sufficient evidence needs to be provided. My main concern for the review is what volume numbers you are using for each asset. Throughout the paper, $100m is used as the ether volume, but I believe that wildly underestimates today’s liquidity. The paper also cites volume stats from 2019 & 2020, which is well out dated by now. The only significant historical stat worth looking at is volatility. Estimated volume numbers should be as current as possible.


I think the analysis also significantly discounts the state of liquidators and their sophistication. Liquidators are no longer just users. Whole protocols/dapps are being built to be liquidators.


With the limited research I have done per-asset, I think the CF can be increased for DAI, USDC, and ETH. If I had to include a fourth, it would be UNI.",39,137.8,2021-02-10

I agree with @Sirokko and @getty that packaging multiple sets of changes together makes it more difficult to:

Analyze the impact of changes / experiments
Exclude changes that have public opposition

As the community gets into the groove of governance, it makes more sense to start slow; a proposal with specific risk changes, then a proposal with specific incentive changes (or vice versa). If they can be separated, they should be, in my opinion. This goes for a category of changes, too: if we’re modifying risk parameters, why not start with one, and measure the impact of it, before changing many?
Risk
Over the past few days, the risk of the protocol has increased significantly; there is now $7.9B of assets supplied, and $3.50B borrowed from Compound. One month ago, we had $4.5B supplied. Take a step back – these are staggering numbers and velocity.
Prior to increasing risk (by increasing CFs), I believe as a community we should evaluated every additional safeguard possible, to decrease the risk of the protocol. This morning I laid out one strategy for improving the liquidation system, and there are many other ideas/approaches. Optimizing CFs (and capital efficiency) is a tool for growth; now is not a time to put the petal to the metal, in my opinion–we already have extreme velocity. We should add better navigation systems, cameras, and tires to this vehicle, first.
Incentives
In Proposal 35, your team laid out a great framework to think about, and model incentives. Prior to changing incentives, let’s revisit your framework and scientific method; deliberately experiment with incentives, and measure the results.
The idea of modifying the COMP distribution is sound; we could modify one stablecoin, and one collateral market (taking @Sirokko’s idea of re-allocating it to collateral), and measure the results. Decrease DAI, increase WBTC, for instance (or, USDC / ETH, etc). How will this change ETH vs WBTC, or DAI vs USDC? This is great data to arm ourselves and the community with.
Conclusion
This is a great direction to set the protocol on–by getting the methodology correct up front, we’ll have a recurring system that works well to calibrate the protocol.",39,127.8,2021-02-10
['Risk Parameter Update - February 2021'],"We’re happy to start slow, so we’ll break these parameters changes up into a couple of proposals as you mention. Given gas costs and also the long lead time for protocol changes, I hope that we can build confidence to bundle changes in the future.
Tenatively, we’ll suggest the following schedule:


Tomorrow - Update the ZRX and BAT collateral factors. I know it feels like the “pedal [is] to the metal” but for these markets, the pedal very much is not.

Next Week - Update the rewards for the USDC and another market

Later Next Week - Update the WBTC collateralFactor as this is a case where the pedal may in fact be through the metal

['Risk Parameter Update - February 2021'],"Hey @jmo , thanks for the analysis plot, a few questions:


How is volatility parameterised. Are you taking it as Gaussian or Power Law or something else?


Have you done a simple convexity analysis? One example:
a. Calculate collateral levels with a 20% drop in WBTC/ETH prices within a time gap delta_t.
b. Calculate collateral levels with a 40% drop in WBTC/ETH prices within a time period delta_t
c. Check whether collateral is convex up or down comparing a. with b. (you can also check convexity with time). If it is convex down, the platform is under-collateralised. If it is convex up, it is buffering and may be sufficiently collateralised.


Have you included second order effects of continuously falling WBTC/ETH prices as liquidations occur?


Have you looked at second order effects of DAI (which itself will face collateralisation challenges in a downmarket)?


Generally, it strikes me that - at current collateralisation levels - a lot of trust in the liquidation mechanisms is required. I’ve laid out some high level ideas and suggestions here:

We’ve used jump diffusion in the past but it’s not super useful. Collateral factor of 80%?  Add in some 25% jumps, yeah liquidators come and force insolvency immediately. Highly volatile GBM price paths cover a wide variety of scenarios. Jumps just don’t clearly make the model more accurate, though is a fun corner case to look into. It’s my understanding that power law price movement is used to approximate the exact sort of liquidation spiral we explicitly simulate, why did you want to look into it?

Right now, we want to use these models to make Compound better, and our focus is on pushing parameters changes that do so.

That interest than distributed between all suppliers in pool proportionate by their share in the pool.
Thus, your APY will fluctuate and change depending how many USDT is borrowed from the pool, as well as depending how many USDT is supplied to the pool as well.

"[""Let's start using Borrow Caps""]","What is the current timeline for introducing borrow caps for the remaining assets? Currently, only $COMP has a borrow cap even though the real threat is an infinite mint from USDC or WBTC draining the protocol.
Borrow caps were introduced a while back and are key for keeping lenders secure but we’ve not seen their  adoption which has the effect of increasing how lenders need to price blow-up risk in the protocol. Without borrow caps, COMP is only as strong as its weakest link",33,116.6,2021-02-16

"[""Let's start using Borrow Caps""]","While i’m not necesserily against borrow caps, i want to point that so far nothing good arrived from it.
Existance of borrow cap at COMP market for example creates nothing more than distorted market, potentially creating risks of bringing it to court for market manipulation.
After readjusting COMP distribution speed for COMP market, that created negative interest rates for borrowing side of COMP market, where users are paid to borrow COMP. However, unlike ETH and WBTC markets, existance of market CAP, creates a priveledged group of users, who borrowed before CAP was reached, and excluding everybody else who want to take advantage of that market situation later, when CAP was reached. And that could potentially be called a market manipulation.
I see market CAP doing more harm really than any good and market would rather be better without it than with it existing in place.
And if infinite mint due some sort of exploit is the only reasoning for existence of market CAP, than i’d rather see algorithm, adjusting market CAP based on hourly average, which would prevent borrowing more than certain percent of total borrowed within one hour. That would pretty much fix your potential attack concern, as for attack, transactions usually  need to happen fast, as often is used in conjuction with flash loans.

"[""Let's start using Borrow Caps""]","Yeah, I was under the impression borrow caps would cap the debt a single collateral could borrow. But it seems to simply cap the amount of debt that can be borrowed of a certain type. This does little to plug the core issue because an infinite mint can still steal number_of_cTokens * remaining_borrow_cap, so the attack scales linearly with number of cTokens and this is a major flaw.
I think it should be a high priority of the community’s to introduce MCD style debt ceilings. This would limit how much a single collateral type could borrow.",23,4.6,2021-02-17
['Adding Price Feeds'],"In conjunction with the building of the medianizer, I want to begin the discussion on what price feeds the community is interested in adding to the medianizer. Currently, Coinbase Pro is the only allowed reporter. Okex is already reporting their price feed, but it hasn’t been enabled in the protocol for use.
A few things to think about:


Once the medianizer goes live, I think we should include Okex.


Jared Flatow mentioned on yesterday’s governance call that the medianizer might want to build in Uniswap, so it doesn’t require more gas to post the price separately. I agree that gas usage is important and that it is worth exploring.


In line with the prior point, the community could consider building Keep3r/uniquote into the medianizer so it could call their contracts for prices. Keep3r currently has support for Uniswap and Sushiswap (added recently). This might be a good low gas method for getting data. Generally, the most popular pools right now are against ETH and not USD, so we would need to convert the ether value of everything to dollars for our purposes. Additionally, the community could consider creating a “job” on the Keep3r protocol that is more specific to Compound’s needs.


Chainlink is worth considering. They have oracles for every market we need and they currently freely display the prices. We would build their oracles into medianizer so that no posting would be required. My rough understanding is that while the prices are currently available for free most projects that utilize them have some kind of agreement with the Chainlink team. I will work on gaining some more clarity on this.


Band oracles are also available for free use (getting clarification might be similar to the chainlink setup) and could be built into the medianizer contract.


The community should lobby for other exchanges to join the Open Oracle Price program. (If you work at an exchange and you’re reading this, please reach out if you are at all curious how this would work).


Personally, trying to optimize for gas, I think, is really important. I think the community should strongly consider building in Band and Chainlink (pending costs). Keep3r is still somewhat new but also a strong consideration. If we can go from using one source (Coinbase) to four (Coinbase, Okex, Chainlink, Band), I think that is a huge improvement for protocol safety and growth. That being said, I don’t want to stop at four, but I think this would be an amazing improvement.

['Insight into risk on Compound'],"As we mentioned in our recent post, we’re going to be making more proposals on Compound to improve risk and capital efficiency. Our platform runs daily stress tests on the protocol that allow us to quantify potential risks and continuously monitor them. Today, we’re releasing the beta version of a risk dashboard for Compound, as we’re hoping to get feedback from the community as we work towards a v1 release.
Gauntlet Dashboard
The dashboard provides statistics on the overall health of the protocol:
1183×260 18.3 KB
The safety grade here is the same one we provide to DeFi Pulse and you can find out how we calculate it here, along with more info on what factors contribute to risk. We also provide statistics for each collateral type which align with those factors:
1141×428 19.3 KB


Collateral Safety - This is a result of our daily simulation runs on the protocol. We currently bucket each collateral type (High / Medium / Low) based on the expected contribution to protocol insolvency risk.

Volatility - Simply, this is 7-day average volatility, annualized.

Liquidity Ratio - This measures the amount of liquidity for each market. This compares the real daily trading volume to the maximum amount of collateral that could be liquidated. A liquidity ratio of 349% means that the daily volume of ZRX is 3.49 times the maximum amount of ZRX collateral liquidators would have to sell given a precipitous drop in ZRX price.

Collateralization Ratio - This is the ratio of the amount of collateral posted to the amount of assets borrowed against it. A CR of 372% means that there are $3.72 of ZRX for every $1 of assets borrowed against it.

Using an analytical methodology to manage risk drastically increases both the capital efficiency and safety of DeFi protocols.

['Insight into risk on Compound'],"That’s certanly very interesting. Maybe you can describe a bit more how your platform accounts for on-chain liquidity via AMM, when calculating Liquidity Ratio?
Since the most concerning simulation is about WBTC, so let’s take it for example. The biggest on-chain liquidity pool for WBTC is currently WBTC-ETH pair on sushiswap, which holds over 1 billion liquidity. Certanly, the daily trading volume on that pair recently is about 50 m daily, but since it’s AMM, obviously there is no issue in increasing trading volume 5 times of that. It’s just there’s no daily demand for that volume, but liquidity certanly could accomodate it with low slippage.
Does your simulations account for that? WBTC-DAI or WBTC-USDC pools at AMM might be small, but there’s little trouble in executing WBTC-ETH-DAI or WBTC-ETH-USDC swaps.
I can understand usage of trading volume for centralized exchanges, as it’s hard to evaluate potential liquidity. But for on-chain liquidity daily trading volume might be not the only indicator, as onchain liquidity is proven and available onchain, even if daily volume doesn’t fully utilize it.

Julia Wu shared DeFi Terminal, a new app that she has been working on. The project is a web app that is built on Compound.js and the Compound API. It fetches data from the API and creates data visualizations like charts and graphs. The community had very positive feedback on the project as well as suggestions of what could be added to improve the app. In addition to Compound, the app also supports Yearn data visualizations.


The Gauntlet team gave a quick update of their progress. They are currently awaiting results of a professional audit. John from Gauntlet thanked the community for its continued analysis and detailed feedback on the proposed changes.


Sorawit, CTO of Band Protocol gave a presentation on his progress on the Open Price Feed changes. The repository of his work is here: GitHub - sorawit/open-oracle-medianizer. There was discussion on how to approach gas price issues and posting prices on chain.

['Proposal: Increase USDT maximum interest rate'],"Summary
The USDT Pool is in danger of running out of liquidity in the near future due to an interest rate curve that does not reflect the unique high borrow demand, high supply risk, and low pool liquidity currently associated with the USDT pool. We should raise the maximum interest rate on the pool’s interest curve to avoid this.
USDT is a unique pool
Let’s compare the amount of supply in the USDT pool vs other pools:
image1790×168 24.1 KB
USDT has a much smaller total supply.
But that’s not even the full picture of the size differences. Let’s look at the proportions of actual liquidity available in these pools yesterday:
image1792×170 23.6 KB
Only 8-9 million of available liquity in USDT yesterday, vs 171 million for USDC.
USDT utilization was over 95% for parts of yesterday.
Why the difference?
USDT is the only pool that does not provide collateral when funds are placed into it. This disadvantages lending USDT vs lending some other stablecoin, and has historically meant that USDT supply has been much lower than USDT and USDC. Along with a lower supply has come higher rates, as the limited supply is allocated by market pricing to those willing to pay the most for it.
It’s a reasonable decision to not have USDT provide collateral. This isolates the damage from USDT loosing its peg down from all pools to only those lending USDT being at risk. This does mean though that this risk is concentrated on the lenders, and the Compound USDT pool becomes a betting market against the future of USDT. Suppose a whale believes that USDT might loose value on Feb 1st. The Whale can deposit 10 million into the USDC pool, take out a 7.5 million dollar loan from the USDT pool, and swap it into USDC (and maybe loop this a few times if desired). If USDT goes to $0.90, the whale can use USDC to repurchase this cheap USDT and pay off the loans, making a profit. If the peg falls to near zero, then the whale could almost 2.0x their initial money, all of this profit at the expense of lenders in the USDT pool.
The risk of this happening drives up the price at which lenders are willing to lend into the pool.
Additionally, there is a lot of demand for USDT for farming purposes right now. USDT only makes up 23.60% of Curve’s 3Pool, and is the most “expensive” coin there. It’s in high demand for borrowing.
The low liquidly in the USDT pool increases the risk getting stuck in the pool when lending, raising rates more.
Finally, the low liquidly increases the size of “shocks” to the APR from liquidity moving in or out. Two million dollars moving out would not be noticeable on the DAI pool, but would make a big swing on the USDT pool.
All together, it is not surprising that USDT pool rates are the highest rates on Compound. It’s fundamentally different pool than the others.
So what?
Even though the USDT pool is very different from other pools, and consistently runs higher interest rates, the interest rate curve for USDT is the same as the other stablecoins.
Most importantly, the maximum interest rate for USDT is the same as other stablecoins. Why does this matter?
What happens when a pool reaches 100% utilization?
The key to Compound’s design is the dynamic interest rates that constantly adjust prices to match supply and demand. If this interest rate were not dynamic, but fixed to a particular rate that did not match real world supply and demand, then a pool would no longer function. If the fixed rate was too high, then no one would borrow and there would not be money to pay the lenders. If the fixed rate was lower than reality, then things are even worse.
Without dynamic pricing a pool is dead. If a pool’s utilization reaches 100%, then the interest rate would be fixed at the highest rate set for that asset - which would be lower than the real world interest rate for that asset.
As long as the the real world interest rate for the asset was higher than the Compound interest rate, the liquidity would be gone and the pool would be stuck in a situation where:

No new borrowers can borrow
No old lenders can withdraw their funds
No sane new lenders would want to lend at below market rates as well as be unable to withdraw their funds afterwards.

These are all very bad things.
There is a self-reinforcing cycle here in that the more that running out of liquidity looks likely to happen in the near future, the higher interest rates lenders will require, reducing the size of liquidity on the pool and increasing the likelihood of it happening.
Proposal
To ensure that prices stay dynamic, the 100% utilization interest rate for USDT needs to be higher it is currently set at.
I propose that we raise the 100% utilization USDT borrow rates to 39.9% APY. In dynamic sitatuions, this allows the price to go up further, continuing the range where supply and demand can interact with each other.
This should have the effect of reducing the risk of lending into the USDT pool, and with reduced risk, potentially increase the totally supply of the pool.
Next Steps.
I’ll leave this up over the weekend for comments, and will calculate the parameters needed and test on a fork next week.",42,478.4,2021-01-30
['Proposal: Increase USDT maximum interest rate'],"It is quite clear that having a max interest rate below market would be very bad for the reasons you described.
Let’s take a step back and acknowledge what the IRMs are trying to do. We want to be generating as much interest as possible while maintaining sufficient market liquidity for normal usage. The new IRMs are kink based models, meaning the rate of change of interest rate increases after a kink. We set this kink to a utilization which allows for the ideal liquidity (currently 20% on cUSDT). The interest rate at the kink point is estimated to be a higher end normal market value for optimal efficiency. Beyond the kink, rates go up dramatically.
With the current environment in DeFi, we are seeing abnormal market activities and consistently high utilization across all the stable coin markets. I would be in favor of raising the rate at kink (across all stablecoins) due to this possibly new norm to encourage greater market liquidity.
While we have seen times with high rates on cUSDT, I don’t believe that raising the max value on the IRM will independently fix this. The high rates are usually temporarily above market, resulting for a large withdrawal or borrow. The withdrawer does not care about the manipulation of rates, and it it takes some time for the market to fix the inefficiencies. What could fix this the liquidity issue, although I would argue against it, is lowering the kink utilization dramatically so that when large moves occur, there is still plenty of liquidity. The issue with this is that it would lower the generated interest a significant amount. If you believe that it is likely for the market USDT supply rate to be over 40% then we definitely should raise the IRM max, but I find this unlikely.",31,41.2,2021-02-01
['Proposal: Increase USDT maximum interest rate'],"Greetings!
I agree with you that there are more options than just raising the max rate.
However, I do strongly see from the data that cUSDT is a very different beast than the other stablecoin pools, and as a result it does need a separate interest rate curve.
cDAI and cUSDC are behaving how we hope to seem them act. In past months they’ve hung out around the kink interest rate. In the last month, with high demand, they have matched expectations well. Demand is indeed up on them, but liquidity is fine. At the moment cDAI has seen a couple days of sustained higher demand, but is steady at 85% utilization and 200 million in liquidity. Even in the last month of higher demand both cDai and cUSDC have spent at least a day down at their targeted kink utilization. Most spikes in cDAI/cUSD rates last only minutes long, as the active pool of borrowers and lenders move money to take advantage of, or to avoid the higher yield.
In contrast cUSDT reached near max utilization on January 19th stayed there for three hours before money moved to correct this. Then cUSDT ran around 90% - 95% utilization for two days at the end of last week, prompting this proposal. This morning rates on cUSDT went up 3x and stayed there for five hours with almost no changes, before correcting back down. These are just a couple examples from the last two weeks of both the high rates that cUSDT is reaching, and the delays in returning to normal. CUSDT has spent 40x more time in the last two weeks at over 90% utilization than the other two coins have averaged.
Taleb says, “never cross a river that averages 4 ft deep”. The problem isn’t so much the average case (even though that’s a 40% higher relative APY’s than the other stablecoins last month), nor is the problem the average true market rate, it’s that cUSDT is spending hours or days in regions of the utilization curve that are unsafe to hang out in. It’s routinely getting near the limits of its emergency maneuvering room in normal usage. In case of a real crunch it has hardly anything extra it can do to return to a balance.
cUSDT fundamentally is different than the other pools, and should have its own curves.
To answer your final question, the last few weeks have already shown that borrowers will spend hours at 25-29% interest as a “market rate”. Regardless of if this is the long term average market rate, it has been shown to be a defacto rate that market players will support for some length of time. It’s hard to know what the max one hour true market rate is because cUSDT can’t go high enough to test it.
It would be poor planning on my part to build a house a foot above the high tide line, because one day we might have a high tide plus a storm. Similarly although this is a high tide time, we haven’t had a storm, and yet the water is already lapping at the front steps some days.
Now it’s true that if we hit 100% utilization and the market eventually corrected itself, that the pool would return to life. But it’s likely that those lenders ,who wanted to withdraw but could not do so during that time, would be burnt and might permanently leave the pool. Others would pull their liquidity faster in the face of future crunches, increasing the likelihood of future crunches.
I think the most important parameter to adjust is the cUSDT max rate. By raising the maximum rate, we increase the incentives on both borrowers and lenders to return things to a more normal rates more quickly. This gives us more headroom for how much out of normal we can handle, and it also should make us spend less time in the danger zone.
As important as it is to be resilient to these unusual times and  not break during them, it is indeed likely that in the next year we’ll be back down to normal operation and hanging out near the kink utilization and interest rates. The current kink position and rate have seemed good for “normal times”, so I’d hate to mess with them. If we wanted to adjust them, we should plan on changing them back during quieter times. While raising the kink APY could indeed make for less of an effect on rates as liquidity moves in and out, that seems like it might be actually be counter-productive if we want to incentivize the pool to act faster. The gains in spare liquity would be small if we moved the kink rate to six percent, and yet doing more would incentivize a lot of borrowers to leave the pool when the rates go below that.",30,11.0,2021-02-01
['Proposal: Increase USDT maximum interest rate'],"I was not aware of the actual durations of high utilization. Thank you for clarifying it in your most recent post. In this case, increasing the max rate would definitely be a valid place to start. Currently cUSDC, cUSDT, and cDAI point to the same IRM so we will need to deploy a new one and point cUSDT to the new IRM.

Compound has reserves for this exact reason, and USDT has a lot, meaning that at 100% UTIL, funds can still be withdrawn

Of course I could be wrong about the effects of this change, but in two months we’ll be able to look at the data and see. Importantly though, I don’t think this interest parameter change is likely to break anything.
I think you are asking about raising the borrowing rate while keeping the lending rate the same? I guess this could somewhat be done by raising the borrowing rate while also increasing the reserve ratio?
There are a few reasons I don’t like that that option.


Reserves themselves, in the current quantity, only provide a tiny buffer to a situation where the market rate is higher than the max rate. Although it stops borrowers from borrowing, it doesn’t stop lenders from pulling their money. Right now the cash reserves on USDT are a sixth of a percent of the total amount lent into the pool.


Reserves are an inefficiency. They make lenders get less money than they otherwise would, thus incetivizing some percentage of lenders to take their money elsewhere where they can get higher rates for their money. For DAI and USDC, lending is wrapped up in providing collateral for borrowing, but for USDT, it’s considerably more about reward and risk on Compound vs risk and reward elsewhere. It’s much nicer for lenders, borrowers, and COMP holders if Compound has more supply in the USDT pool, rather than having less. (Some reserves are necessary, but increasing the  reserve ratio can be a good thing.)


Adjusting both the borrow rates and the reserve amount is more complicated than just adjusting one parameter.


Unless we write a new interest rate algorithm, adjusting the reserve ratio affects the entire curve, not part of it. Most of the curve seems to work okay. It’s just the 90-100% area that I think needs some tweaking.

If USDT lose value, reason for that can only be underlying collateral problems (problem with depositing dollars for minting USDT).

However the added risk of a possible peg loss makes lending USDT less attractive (you could loose the value of what you have lent out) and the same risk makes borrowing USDT more attractive (you might get to pay back your debt with something cheaper). These two result in a decrease in supply and an increase in demand, which pushes the interest rate upwards to find a balance.

['Formal Analysis Period for Larger Proposals'],"[Copied over from Comadery]
Background
As Compound Governance evolves, it is becoming more obvious that certain proposals need a longer time for pre-vote analysis. For instance: The COMP issuance rebalancing proposal (CP011) effects not only Compound, but caused externalities that impact borrowing/supply demand such as Dai issuance and the Dai peg. These externalities affect both systems and deserve a more thorough analysis than proposals that are more straightforward. Compare CP011 to CP014 (née CP013), which aims to change the collateral factor for WBTC to be non-zero. This is a much more straightforward vote as the main economic risk factors deal with answering the following questions:

Should WBTC be used as collateral in spite of the centralization/liquidity issues?
Is 65% the right collateral factor? If not, why is it too low/high?

In order to accommodate the differences in analysis complexity (especially with regards to economics), we propose adding a  formal analysis period  to each vote.
On-Chain Formal Analysis Periods
A formal analysis period is defined as a non-voting period where a proposal is active (e.g. submitted on-chain). Right now, a proposal is defined such that voting starts at block height  startBlock  (defined as the predecessor block of the block height where  propose  is called) and ends at block height  endBlock = startBlock + 17820  (roughly 3 days). With this format, all votes get the same time. We instead propose that another block height  beginVotingBlock  is added such that:

The block height interval  [startBlock, beginVotingBlock)  represents a time where no votes are allowed to be cast but the proposal is on-chain (for provenance) and interested parties can inspect the proposal
The block height interval  [beginVotingBlock, endBlock]  is exactly the same as the current voting interval
We hold the invariant  beginVotingBlock >= startBlock  with  startBlocks == beginVotingBlock  equivalent to the current situation (e.g no formal analysis period)

Using the extra parameter  beginVotingBlock  allows for the proposer to signal and declare the following on-chain:

The proposal  requires  at least  analysis_time(proposal) = [startBlock, beginVotingBlock)  blocks of analysis.
If  analysisTime(proposal) > analysisTime(proposal') , where  proposal'  is another proposal, then the proposer signals to all voters that  proposal  is worth more careful analysis (in terms of time) than  proposal'

By adding this as a parameter to  GovernorAlpha.propose()  each of these analysis periods is documented on-chain for provenance so that the community can later analyze which types of proposals need more/less analysis

The extra work of doing this on-chain will allow for the community to look back upon how different changes require different levels of analysis. This change requires a simple, two-line mutation to  contracts/governance/GovernanceAlpha.sol  :
function propose(address[] memory targets, uint[] memory values, string[] memory signatures, bytes[] memory calldatas, string memory description, uint memory analysisTime) public returns (uint) { … uint startBlock = add256(block.number, votingDelay()); uint beginVotingBlock = add256(startBlock, analysisTime); uint endBlock = add256(beginVotingBlock, votingPeriod()); … }
It is our belief that by documenting on-chain the relative amount of difficulty for each proposal, we can provide better analysis and guide informed decisions as Compound Governance manages an ever expanding set of digital assets.",56,496.2,2020-07-17
['Formal Analysis Period for Larger Proposals'],"I wanted to copy over @hayesgm’s comment too, which is important:
@Tarun, that makes sense, but why add a new variable when we could  just  adjust the  votingDelay ? The intent of vote delay was to allow time to 1) analyze the proposal and 2) allow users to move tokens prior in anticipation of a vote (e.g. set-up delegation).
Also, changing the Timelock is a significantly more difficult task than changing the Governor. The Timelock has a fixed minimum of 2-days and swapping the Timelock requires changing the admin on each cToken.",50,55.0,2020-07-17
['Formal Analysis Period for Larger Proposals'],"I’d like to push this proposal up the forum again for visibility. We are still having rather short voting periods for rather large adjustments, which makes it clear that voting is intended for persons that are checking the protocol daily, despite their actual stake in the protocol.
I would want to highlight the need to increase the amount of time it takes to properly evaluate a large change in the Compound protocol, and then the time it takes the individual to make an informed decision on said proposal.
2 days seems like an awfully short time considering the repercussions of the result.
Has there been a detailed analysis on voter participation in a 2-day timeframe vs let’s say a 5-day timeframe?
We are mature enough to consider such a move, especially since we’re the protocol that values safety over rash decision making. Only granting 2 days for big changes seems like a rushed effort, and I’d like to see this extended to multiple days, on top of the proposed formal analysis period.
Either way, there should be more option to discuss votes before they come on-chain, to simply avoid frustration, align expectation, and deliver the results that everyone wants to see manifest.",29,65.8,2021-02-04
['Formal Analysis Period for Larger Proposals'],"I’d like to second this opinion and thanks for bringing this up! I agree that the timeframe for voting is too short.
I’m a community contributor to the Index Coop and at the Coop we provide $INDEX holders the opportunity to vote on Compound proposals (through the tokens locked in the $DPI, which currently has ~$10.5M or 21’615 COMP in AuM). At the moment, the $DPI (and hence the Coop) is among the top 50 COMP holders.
We recently published our view on meta-governance, and stated our intention to take this responsibility seriously, and to act as informed and trusted token holder. However, we as community members can only inform INDEX tokens holders, we cannot vote for them. Hence, we want to do our best to keep INDEX holders updated, so that they can make an informed decision when voting.
Long story short, it would definitely be easier to achieve this, if we had more than 2-3 days. Currently we use Twitter and Discord to inform on new proposals. Ideally, we would have at least 5-7 days. This would give the community more time to prepare a summary (or potentially recommendations), and more time for Index holders to review the proposals.",25,40.0,2021-02-09

['Brief History of Error Handling in the Protocol'],"I’ve mentioned before that there’s some history to the way we do error handling in the protocol (On Interest Rate Models). Since this question comes up from time to time, I wanted to give a brief summary.
The first batch of Compound v2 contracts were compiled and deployed using Solidity 0.5.8. Most of these contracts were immutable and are still in use today. Besides still being used, the first cTokens established conventions inherited by later contracts.
Error handling was always a big topic of discussion, even when developing the first v2 contracts. The original reason for using error codes, was that the EVM did not have revert with reason at the time. Thus if you wanted to know what went wrong, you needed to emit a log, and in order to do that the transaction needed to succeed. So in general, the contracts were written in a “Check Effects Interactions” style.
Another benefit of using logs was that anyone could look at the tx on chain and see what went wrong. This meant that as developers, if users were having issues, we could help diagnose issues after the fact. Over time, Etherscan and others added more support for being able inspect the call stack for reverts.
By the time we had become fully comfortable with the idea of using revert with reason everywhere, our contracts weren’t changing much. At some point, we finally decided that all new code would be written using reverts, and that old code could be rewritten using reverts, if and when the appropriate time ever came.
Slowly, we are moving to reverts everywhere. Eventually, it is possible all contracts using the ‘old-style’ errors will have been deprecated by the protocol.",24,119.8,2021-02-09
['COMP Distribution Incentives'],"We (Gauntlet) wanted to provide an update on our work to add better incentives for COMP distribution. First, we wanted to go into more detail on the reasoning behind our current proposal. Next, we describe our plan going forward to get this proposal out to Mainnet.
Why vesting?
COMP Rewards have driven usage of Compound (and honestly, of DeFi in general) since their inception last year.
However, we could categorize this usage into two buckets:

Organic Demand

People who already wanted to use the protocol, who now receive COMP rewards


COMP Farming

People using the protocol just for the COMP rewards

These people often use circular borrows and immediately sell the COMP.





From Robert’s announcement, the goals of COMP distribution are for users to “automatically receive governance rights, for free— in order to shape the future of the protocol”
In the case of farming, this goal is not met because these users clearly have no intention of shaping the future of the protocol, as they immediately surrender those rights to their exit liquidity. It can be hard to differentiate the nature of usage between the two categories above but from some simple analysis, it’s clear that farming is a considerable percentage of current usage. A second problem arises as well with farming - it creates a huge stream of COMP that is consistently dumped on exchanges, punishing protocol supporters who hold COMP.
So how can we distribute COMP to people who care about the future of the protocol? The vesting and cooldown proposals that Gauntlet has put together use a simple heuristic to determine if users have interest in the success and future of Compound - they are long COMP.
Now, on a short timeframe (e.g. a cooldown or vesting period of < 30 days), the effects of any vesting/cooldown proposal would merely mitigate the second issue of COMP being dumped on exchanges. But as that timeframe increases, you force farmers to take on more and more COMP exposure.

Why wouldn’t this just delay when farmers dump all of the COMP?

With the simplest assumptions, it would, but it would also force the farmers to care about COMP price (as a proxy for Compound in general) for the length of the vesting/cooldown period
One thing to note that the cost incurred is commensurate to the user’s desire to be long COMP. If you want to hold all of your farming rewards as COMP, the cost is negligible.

This would ideally make farming more attractive to users who cared about the future of Compound, and should shift the user base in this direction. If/when these changes go through, we’ll see if this is the case.




There is clearly a balance here, because you also start to deteriorate the experience for organic demand users who now have to manage the cooldown period

Even some organic users want to reduce exposure, which is reasonable to a limited extent even for the most ardent of Compound supporters



Now, this is not the only way to reward people who care about the protocol with COMP, you could create a staking pool (as SNX, AAVE, and others have) or pay users in COMP to vote. However, neither of these would fix the current issues with distribution, though it would reward users who bought COMP from farmers and then participated, which would have its own benefits. Also just a reminder - COMP can now be paid directly to community contributors (after proposal CP030). Participants who drive value to COMP, who might rely on COMP rewards, can just get them directly via Governance.
Next steps
We got great feedback on Discord as well as during the dev call, and we’ve put together a plan for addressing the most salient points here. Most notably, this new version will preserve the existing API much better. Going forward, our plan is to:

Incorporate final dev feedback
Audit the code with Quantstamp
Testing on Kovan
Propose adding the cooldown logic (ETA first week of February, though timelines are not finalized). Starting with a 0-length cooldown, the community can decide on what works over time.

If the proposal passes, we’ll then reach out to wallets and other partner applications as we work to turn on the functionality by setting a cooldown > 0.
If it doesn’t, we’re happy to respect the community’s decision here.

['COMP Distribution Incentives'],"@jmo, the work that you @tarun and the Gauntlet team have done in exploring / proving a number of vesting/cooldown approaches is fantastic and deserves recognition.
Last week’s community call walked through the cooldown codebase, and gathered lots of new feedback from the community. Everyone seems fully aligned with the goal of getting more COMP in the hands of loyal users - while dissuading purely exploitative farming.
In Discord, @lay2000lbs raised the issue that a cooldown will degrade / complicate the user experience (for normal users, farmers, and integrated products), which I agree with. Additional steps, delays, and flows is a “stick”, that hits farmers harder than organic users. While this will likely tilt usage towards organic users, it might still sting.
Extending @johndoh 's idea a bit, I wanted to take a moment to explore the “carrot” path, to make the COMP Distribution as uplifting as possible.

Upgrade: Distribute cCOMP
Instead of distributing COMP, the claim() and grantCompInternal() functions can be upgraded to distribute cCOMP to users. This would convert the uncollected COMP, into COMP supplied to the protocol, earning interest and increasing borrowing capacity (if collateral is enabled). At any time, users can withdraw COMP from the protocol. If users are looking for liquidity, they can borrow any asset (like a stablecoin) instead.
To a user, the status quo (post-claim) switches from a decision on “what to do” with COMP (supply it, or sell it), to a decision on “whether to withdraw it”.
This can be paired with significantly reducing the gas costs of the claim() function (by moving compAccrued to the end of the function to run/distribute once, instead of looping over a transfer function multiple times).
Note: this wasn’t possible when the Distribution first launched (cCOMP didn’t exist yet).
Upgrade: Enable cCOMP voting
The Governor Bravo (a modernized Governance framework) in development could be upgraded to allow cCOMP voting alongisde (or eventually, instead of) COMP voting.
All COMP earned by users would be able to immediately vote, further reducing the incentive to withdraw COMP from the protocol, and increasing participating in governance.
Note: this might require modifying the cCOMP implementation with a balance checkpoint first.

After releasing these upgrades, the community could monitor whether participation in the governance process has increased. If it hasn’t, the cCOMP contract could be updated with the Cooldown logic – locking users into a longer (but more useful) commitment.
Ideas / thoughts / counterarguments are very welcomed.",64,87.8,2021-01-18
['COMP Distribution Incentives'],"I like this idea.
I will say, after reading @jmo explanation I’m less opposed to the original implementation. I’m more neutral on it. It would be an interesting experiment that I personally don’t think would meaningful change behavior but I’m still curious to see the outcome.
Going back to Rob’s proposal I like the idea of transitioning the question from “what to do with COMP” to “Whether to withdraw it”. I also like reducing gas costs and enabling cCOMP to natively vote. The only thing I don’t like is that again, we may be overloading the function of the COMP market. If at the end of the day we’re trying to incentives holding COMP let’s create something that does exactly that, rather than hacking an interest rate market to sort of do it.
I believe a key learning here is that current COMP distribution is an amazing way to incentives capital allocation and a very poor way to distribute governance to long term stakeholders. So perhaps we should re-frame COMP distribution as the capital incentive for the protocol and start fresh on how we want to distribute governance to long term stakeholders… I’ve heard rumors of @blck and @arr00 working on something that may be relevant here.
Anyway, I’m starting to feel like a perpetual critic and I do appreciate the concrete nature of Rob’s suggestion. I think it meets two critical criteria in that 1) it’s an improvement on existing user experience and 2) it plausibly will reduce COMP farm and dumping somewhat. So it’s likely the best next step forward.",55,41.0,2021-01-19

I’m getting slightly off topic, but maybe instead of incentivizing deposits to cCOMP (which has some possible negative externalities like more votes available to rent), we could create a staking insurance mechanism similar to stkAAVE and funnel liquidity incentives into this.
User would deposit COMP to staking module/market and receive stkCOMP. If there was a loss event to the protocol, a certain percentage of the value would be seized and sold on the market to recapitalize the system. And the cooldown logic could be applied here to disincentivize immediate dumping, along with incentives in the form of COMP issuance or redirecting some of the reserves earned by other markets to stakers.",51,30.2,2021-01-19

We’ll finish the audit of the cool down and post the final version to the Compound github for the community to consider after landing these other initiatives.

['COMP Distribution Incentives'],"I’ve been developing a new method for COMP distribution for a while now and think we should come to some sort of consensus before I continue moving forward.
What I have been developing is essentially a way for users to stake their COMP for a determined period of time with linear decaying weighting (like CRV staking). Dividends are then distributed to stakers based on their weighting. Initially, this would only distribute COMP, but it supports the addition of new assets, such as funneled reserve factors. Users maintain full delegation rights on their COMP, but are unable to remove it until their stake period ends. Dividends are continually claimable, but only if the account delegated to participates in governance (votes).
I decided to go this route because I don’t believe that incentivizing cCOMP or restricting users’ ability to claim is the way to go. Giving cCOMP voting power essentially allows for an unbounded amount of votes only limited by the borrow cap. Cooldowns are a nice idea, but the fact that it would break contracts interacting with compound is a dealbreaker for me.",47,44.4,2021-01-20

I hope this one is not too much off topic:
Being an “ordinary user” who likes and supports the idea behind Comound/COMP but without in depth technical knowledge on the topic, I am just wondering why the fees to claim accrued COMP are so extremely high.

Or is there now a threshold amount in place beyond which the cost to claim becomes resonable?
Since there were some thoughts mentioned above on the motivation of the different types of users, let me quickly tell you about mine. Maybe others share the same.
It’s not my intention to sell the COMP immediately, but instead I would just like to see the COMP that have accrued end up in my wallet and made available again to the community; by that granting me voting rights (that I would delegate to one of the “professionals” around) and adding to generating more COMP interest.",37,7.4,2021-02-07

['Grants Committee Draft and Rationale'],"A few months ago, @rleshner started asking some fundamental questions about the compound protocol and its underlying economic models.
DAI Market Risk
Distribution Speeds
Reserve Factor Standardization
Many found these issues very perplexing and exciting, but few could come to the drafting board and bring forward a research report on the subject. I believe this is because of the most significant underlying issue. There is no efficient way to reward contributors.
In the past, when a contributor wanted to claim a bounty, they would have to put the grant within the governance proposition itself. Some examples are,
“The last two calls withdraw from the cSAI reserves about $5000 worth of SAI and sends it to Arr00 as a bounty for organizing and implementing this proposal.”, source
“The last two actions take 622 Sai (currently valued at $1200) from reserves and transfer them to Arr00 as a bounty for his work on this proposal.” source
“1. Award ourselves a COMP grant (1000 COMP) to offset development and audit costs.” _grantcomp in Action
See, two of these three self-granting instances came from @arr00, a community member who took time out of his days to develop some smart contracts and better our protocol.
This is amazing! An internet friend of ours could take such a risk, to work on something that has no history of financial reward; that is until he started that precedence. But was it that risky? Not to minimize his contribution, arr00 didn’t have to act like Compound was a full-time job. He is a freelancer of sorts, one who has received grants and has written smart contracts.
Then why is Arr00 the only individual to grant himself Comp in a proposal? It wasn’t always like that.
Publicly speaking, the biggest proposers of governance props were founders and team other entities like Dharma, Gauntlet, Almeda, and BLCK (I will return to that soon). These entities are not financially constrained, similar to students or new potential contributors, with some exceptions. These are VC backed entities with payroll, resources, experience, and knowledge. Besides “testing” out _grantcomp, these entities have not publicly granted themselves a “development fee.”
The larger entities are substantial holders of Comp, it’s no secret. I believe that they deserve it; without these companies and individuals, their support and hard work, DEFI, Compound, and innovation in finance would not be here today.
But at the end of the day, the smaller contributors have not flourished as they should have in DECENTRALIZED finance. In fact, as of September (old data), this paper
has measured COMP token distribution and has computed its GINI, or wealth inequality of COMP, our governance token to being worse than Afghanistan. Wealth Gini
GINI695×162 27 KB
As I stated before, this data is ancient and does not reflect the current efforts to democratize distribution, including delegation, ie. BLCK, CAP’s, or our future grants. It is not like many crypto projects are much better in terms of “equality,” and Compound has been very competent at shifting the balance. Again, this figure is simply the starting point. The founders had to slowly distribute power towards the community, which is precisely part of that process.
So how does BLCK play into this?
Well, he/she has enough Comp delegated to start a proposal, and in the past, a few contributors have “gone through” the account to launch a proposal, including ones with self grants. I do not know where blck gets his or her votes, but one thing for sure is that this account significantly speeds up the process for small contributors and benefits all.
Now, this situation, while very innovative, is not ideal … to get a grant or start a project, a contributor must…


Create project/code proposition


if not enough Comp to start a CAP or no one with 100k COMP will support you…


Reach out to blck / get the COMP to start a CAP


“Lobby” for votes


Passed, get your compensation


This process does not cover the difficulty and time of actually working on a proposal, which should be where one spends the majority of their time, not lobbying.
But what does blck think? (or how will I project it?)
“i can only think about scales in my country people here working 1 month for 3-4 COMP value”
“in my country regular people work for 8-9 month for that money so it’s just point of view how much is it”
Not to speak for others, but there seems to be unused (cheaper) labor in other countries, where people need jobs, want to contribute and live with wealth inequality, not ERC-20 inequality. (laugh here).
Now according to the Call to action, the Comptroller is growing at over 500 COMP a day (old number) that,
and I quote from @rleshner
“that can be used to expand & improve the Compound protocol”
So two questions
1 How much should be allocated?
2 How do we implement it?
So when it comes to how much, we need to remember where the funds come from. Well, in this passed proposal, (forum) Gauntlet added two functions to the comptroller, _grantcomp and _setContributorCompSpeed. These allow governance to grant COMP and stream COMP to any address. The grant or stream would come from the comptroller address.
Maybe a few months ago, it would have been more evident how much there is to allocate, because recently, with Comptroller Optimizations, and new COMP speeds, the comptroller COMP balance has been “kind of weird.” The Wchanges in COMP balance is calculable, but since the COMP is now manual and distribution speeds are changed, the COMP’s equation at time ‘t’ is now more difficult to calculate.
New conservative COMP distribution speeds have allowed the rate at which comptroller COMP grows to grow (i.e. (dy/dt) >1). The Comptroller is gaining more Comp than it is losing, consistently.
Below is a Time Series of the COMP balance for the Comptroller, where grant funds come from.
compt1186×638 60.3 KB
To err on the side of caution, a stream of 1/comp a day (to utilize the new stream function) and a 15k COMP one-time grant (can be renewed annually) would be considered reasonable.
In contrast, this (15,365.24) COMP for the year will leave a snapshot buffer of around 150k COMP for the Comptroller, and the grant stream grows at approximately 0.2% the speed of which the Comptroller does.
So what would this “grants” system look like? Let’s look at some other defi Projects for Comparison.
We have… (along with my sarcastic commentary)
SNX

Synthetix has a very well documented application process, but at the moment, SNX is still highly centralized and does not have an on-chain or formal voting process.

UNI


So UNI has historically been unable to reach quorum except for the grants system. The grants program has clear responsibilities laid out for committee members and a great purpose and methodology system.


Problem I find with their program is the members of the committee. They include @rleshner and other excellent defi CEO’s, and members get paid around $400 an hour, but they have yet to meet or sit through grants (as per last time I asked @rleshner


Team members are too busy to deal with this stuff, especially stuff that’s not their platform. I am not sure if they were asked about it before, but this seems like a ceremonial position, which is inefficient.


No offense to these CEO’s, but if the grants program is meant for small international contributors, then the UNI committee is not demographically and socioeconomically diverse compared to those applying. Grant committee work is work. It’s tedious, complicated, time-consuming, and mentally draining, and most importantly @rleshner is not our Compound Czar.


Curve


Similar Problem, heavy hitters, grant committee, with Charlie, Andre, and some others. They have yet to get through with feedback or fill grants.


Again, these individuals already have a crazy amount of voting power on Curve, and they are in charge of the grants committee, yet the harvest has not been made, and little progress has come from the little guy.


Balancer
Balancer 2

So balancer took a different path; these grants are for DAOs and companies. AAVE, PIEDAO, ZAPPERFI all got hundreds of thousands of dollars to develop and integrate into balancer.

1.This approach is very business-focused, and while it does make sense, balancer is far from decentralized, and its grants do not directly help the contributor we are trying to reach.
AAVE


Very similar to balancer, but a little closer to the DAO side, Flashboys, aavewatch, collateral swap have all been recipients of grants…


They bring quality integration similar to Comp.Vote and are closer to helping the average contributor

UTILIZE SNAPSHOT VOTING


Seriously, Having every step of the way on Snapshot is the best thing for democracy.


For example, look how cUNI Snapshot is handled; it is beautiful.
We also tried out a Snapshot.voting test to see what compensation for Comp.vote should look like. Just imagine what the community would be like if everyone got compensated for the work we did.
For example, take a look at these uncompensated mini projects the community has done, like DAI Liquidation Report, Oracle Solution, WBTC CFactor, and COMP distribution speeds research.
While these projects should be compensated retroactively, we can vote on that later if someone proposes it as a project.
I suggest you take a look at what I have created on GitHub regarding how Snapshot will be integrated with this multisig grants committee.

['Grants Committee Draft and Rationale'],"There are great points. Makes me think that there should be a ‘Grant Master’ role in the community to spearhead these efforts (with COMP compensation for his efforts). Budgeting COMPS wisely can generate lots of future growth for the platform and create a much better-engaged community. Few things that come to my mind (just some early thoughts):


Growth capital allocation from treasury - like @massnomis suggested I think there should a periodic budget of COMPS which is considered as ‘growth budget’ taken from the treasury (similar to any organization budgeting for growth). I would suggest it will be divided into R&D (actual development work), Marketing (Research, PR), and Other. I would propose the budget should be ~15-30% of periodic treasury earning due to the early days and growth potential of Compound, but obviously this number should be thought on carefully.


Call for projects - there could be an open list of projects waiting to be fullfiled with a specific grant for each one. I think each community member should be able to vote on adding a project to this list, with the Grant Master managing the whole operation. A selected committee can once in 1-2 months pick ‘winners’ for anyone who will nominate himself to fulfill a grant project.

['Grants Committee Draft and Rationale'],"Thank you, @massnomis, for writing up this idea.
Although I have been somewhat against building a committee in the past, I think I was coming at it from the wrong side. My original stance was that good ideas will get funding with the current state of development in Compound. While I think that is still true, I wasn’t thinking about how the downside versus upside in building a committee that can execute a little faster than full governance. In the grand scheme of the protocol and the COMP that the community has to work with, I think allocating some portion to a committee is worth a shot. I think the downside is significantly smaller than the upside, and I think the worst-case scenario is not bad.
I also believed that Snapshot governance isn’t necessary for this to work, but I’ve changed my mind on that as well. Using the current governance system isn’t inexpensive and can be somewhat cumbersome, and using polling on the forum doesn’t take into account the user’s COMP holding. Using Snapshot as a signal for what COMP holders want to support is a good middle ground. Snapshot is completely gasless, so users shouldn’t be deterred from voting due to fees. I would also like to experiment with giving COMP holders in liquidity pools a say in the protocol. Other protocols have adopted this; for example, Sushi gives 1 vote per SUSHI held and 2 votes to SUSHI in ETH-SUSHI LP.
I have many projects/improvements (small and large) that I would be interested in allocating COMP rewards to. I do think if we could more easily allocate COMP to builders that more improvements would occur.
While I would be happy to be on the committee, I think allocating some rewards to committee members for their involvement and time would be needed. I think this could be done with the _setContributorCompSpeed and a rate of 0.00004. The committee would need to do a lot of work to make this a successful program, but I think it is possible.
One immediate problem that comes to mind is how the committee would deal with rewards/grants to committee members. All of the likely committee members are users who do their own development. I think the simple answer, for now, is that if a committee member wants a reward or grant for work they have done that they need to recuse themself from the process or ideally use a full goverance proposal to be rewarded.

Thats not true, protocol need data price oracle that reflects the price of asset closest to the global price of that asset. I understand that task is very hard because exist trade-off between flexibility, trust and cost for set-up reliable oracle. For example existing Compound solution isnt reliable because relies on centralized system.

['Change my mind: Compound protocol is moving too slowly'],"I am follow simply logic.

Market price is equillibrium of buyer and seller preferences and their perspective of value
In “DAI liquidation” event, price of DAI reaches 1.3$ on Coinbase open price feed but global market price was still 1$
I am very interesting who will pay 1.3$ for DAI when he can pay 1$ everywhere or mint DAI on Oasis (1$). Is this normal and rational behaviour?
Some people here say that was a structural DAI problem but didnt - because if this is true global price will also spike to 1.3$. In scenario where global price spike to 1.3$ we can talk about bad users risk management.
In this case that is clear maniplation with front running elements and of course we cant get transparent information from Coinbase because they are centralized platform.
For Chainlink or Maker oracle solution data are available ( deep dive in Oracle and Medianizer threads )

In my opinion Chainlink is best solution in short-medium terms but in long term best option is that Compound build own oracle. Everything is better then present solution. But we also know close cooperation between Compound and Coinbase because Coinbase Venture is early investor in project. Because of that I dont expect quality solution for that problem.

['CToken sweepToken function'],"Following up on the idea of returning accidental funds sent to cTokens when possible, I wrote a quick code change which enables us to do this. The new function sweepToken(address) is a very simple addition which allows anyone to sweep the entire balance of any ERC20 (except for the underlying) to the admin (timelock).
The new function is as follows for CErc20:
/**
  * @notice A public function to sweep accidental ERC-20 transfers to this contract. Tokens are sent to admin (timelock)
  * @param token The address of the ERC-20 token to sweep
  */
function sweepToken(EIP20Interface token) external {
  require(address(token) != underlying, ""CErc20::sweepToken: can not sweep underlying token"");
  uint256 balance = token.balanceOf(address(this));
  token.transfer(admin, balance);
}

And as follows for CEther:
/**
  * @notice A public function to sweep accidental ERC-20 transfers to this contract. Tokens are sent to admin (timelock)
  * @param token The address of the ERC-20 token to sweep
  */
function sweepToken(EIP20Interface token) external {
  uint256 balance = token.balanceOf(address(this));
  token.transfer(admin, balance);

['YFI Listing Proposal'],"yEarn Overview
Yearn.finance (“yEarn”) is a DeFi yield aggregator and optimizer.
yEarn uses a suite of DeFi protocols and primitives including yTokens and delegated vaults to maximize yield.
YFI is yEarn’s governance token. YFI is an ERC-20 token used to vote on yEarn improvement plans (“YIPs”) and new yield strategies for liquidity providers. Token holders can stake their YFI through the governance portal to earn a percentage of fees generated by the protocol.
Background
yEarn was launched in early 2020 and initially optimized yield across Compound, dydx, Aave, and Fulcrum. yEarn has continued to add new DeFi products including yleverage.finance and ypool.finance.
In mid-July 2020, yEarn announced the release of the YFI token. Given the number of configurable parameters in yEarn, the YFI token is used by the community to govern the protocol. There was no pre-mine, sale, or allocation for investors/team. YFI was only earned by providing liquidity.
30,000 YFI tokens were minted and have been fully earned/distributed among the community. The community is currently working with firms such as Delphi Digital and Gauntlet to construct an optimal token model and inflation schedule.
A 6/9 Gnosis Safe multisig has been granted full rights over the YFI governance contract. YIP 40 proposes replacing inactive multisig signers with four new signers.
Since the launch of YFI, yEarn has grown from $8M to over $1 billion in total value locked (“TVL”).
YFI Liquidity Venues
YFI trades on decentralized exchanges including Uniswap and Balancer, as well as centralized exchanges including Binance and FTX.
YFI’s 24-hour volume on Binance currently stands at $17MM across USDT and BTC pairs. On Uniswap, YFI’s 24-hour volume stands at $5.4MM.
YFI Holder Base
1600×679 170 KB
Source: Etherscan
Rationale

yEarn has one of the most engaged and active communities. This has translated into a YFI holder base looking for liquidity/leverage on their YFI. Compound could become the first DeFi platform to offer liquidity on YFI, further increasing borrow demand and utilization of assets on Compound.
Initially, the community may see value in having a collateral factor of 0% to reduce risk to lenders. Additionally, if passed, the borrow limits proposal may help mitigate risk to lenders.

Risks

YFI is a relatively new token with a limited track record of volatility and trading history.
yEarn multisig and its potential exposure to lenders.

On October 1st, Proposal 24 was passed to raise WBTC’s Collateral Factor from 40% to 60%. According to Defi Pulse, on October 1st, there were ~$1B of WBTC in circulation. Today there are $4.38B of WBTC in circulation. In addition to having a much larger supply today, WBTC liquidity has significantly grown since Proposal 24 was passed.

I don’t see how other protocols success/utility has a factor in Compound Finance’s decision making. What matters is if the liquidators can safely handle WBTC being used as collateral. We have more than enough evidence to support this.
While your report shows your processes, it does not mention WBTC once.",29,125.8,2021-02-03
['Set WBTC Collateral Factor to 75%'],"I’d be happy to explain anything that is unclear:

In general, we try to vote quickly so other people can read our analysis before voting. After we realized we set the wrong bool value, we were hoping there was some way for us to change our vote (we even tried to call castVote again, but as you might know, that will fail), but we were unable to find a way, so posted here to clarify.
""I don’t see how other protocols success/utility has a factor in Compound Finance’s decision making. "" - The risk to Compound’s solvency is mostly due to liquidation failures. The quantity of an asset on Compound increases both the likelihood of a liquidation spiral as well the size potential loss in the case a spiral occurs. Maker, which has a limit of just over $200mm for WBTC, just has to sell less WBTC in the case the price drops, and carries less risk*.
Our report focuses ETH but the methodology can be applied to any asset, and we pull live market data for each asset that we stress test to ensure our model is as accurate as possible.

Sadly, WBTC != BTC, especially not over short timescales. It has less than 1% of the BTC market cap and ~5% of the trading volume. WBTC is different than other assets in that people can create/redeem it from BTC (I think we talked about this on Discord a little while back). This might help create more liquidity for the asset, but we haven’t incorporated this functionality into our models yet. We hope to do this soon, however because BTC block confirmations are pretty slow, and liquidation spirals happen quickly, it’s unclear the impact this would have on recommended collateralFactors.
*All other things being equal, which they are not since Maker uses auctions for liquidations. This is why in our stress tests, we run the actually Compound contracts in a modified version of geth to ensure these nuances are handled correctly.",31,61.2,2021-02-03

The top 10 cWBTC users are over 69% of the total cWBTC use. These users are well collateralized, intelligent, and fast-acting. These are NOT the people we need to worry about. The primary reason to increase the collateral factor is for when the market does go down, it gives a little extra breathing room, and it is great for people interacting with the protocol programmatically and can run close to the CF limit while constantly adjusting to avoid liquidation. An 8% liquidation penalty and another 17% of cushion are more than enough wiggle run.",31,166.2,2021-02-03

['Creating natural demand for COMP'],"Lots of discussions lately have been around the supply side of COMP - emission speed and distribution between markets. These are major factors but they affect only the supply-side in the COMP capital market.
End of the day, even if someone is a pure yield farmer and immediately drops his farmed COMPs on the market, there is someone on the other side that buys it for a certain price.
Good assets on capital markets maintain a healthy equilibrium between natural demand and speculators’ demand. Speculators have an important role in the price discovery mechanism while natural demand is usually derived from a long-term approach that sees the economic value in the asset and believes some kind of value accrues. This value accrual will provide a chance to sell at a higher price in the future (to other natural demand buyers or speculators).
But for natural demand to occur, data and thorough analysis about the economic potential of an asset must be publicly available and discussed in the idea market (via social media, blogging, etc.)
In traditional capital markets, analysts, investor relations, individual investors, investment banks, and other financial participants play the role of creating a long term natural demand. In Crypto, I believe this role should be taken by the community.
I feel this part of the Compound ecosystem is still highly undeveloped. I did not find even one good document to analyze the COMP tokens’ potential from an economic perspective. This also plays a role in the upcoming Compound chain adoption, as no analysis currently shows the effect on COMP.
Creating strong natural demand for COMP will increase long term holding, improve the decentralization of Compound, and increase value for loyal community members who Hodl COMP.
I suggest that a certain amount of COMP should be allocated to individuals and community members that will generate a high-quality analysis of the comp token attributes, the potential of Compound to serve an integral role in the future DeFi rails, the impact of the upcoming Compound chain rollup, and the potential of the protocol to be worth tens of $B in the future as an infrastructure layer in DeFi.

['Rewarding Contributors'],"I’d like to kick off a discussion on building some community norms on how to award people who contribute to the protocol. My opinion is that we should err towards being overly generous to contributors to help create and sustain interest in developing the protocol.
Baseline community standard:

I’d propose a baseline of 10 COMP to any address that submits a proposal that goes to vote
An additional 10 COMP to any address that submits a proposal that is approved

I think this should be the floor of what someone receives even if the proposal is just for a simple parameter change.
Proposal specific bonuses
On top of this baseline there should be proposal specific bonuses for proposals that required unique work. This could be requested by the proposer or recommended by independent members of the community
Bonuses for work not in proposals
Much work on the protocol does not result proposals and should be recognized and rewarded through periodic true ups. Examples of this would be things like Comp.vote, Blck’s transaction bot, Warios help with the DAI compensation proposal, etc.
Backdated rewards
To kick things off I’d like to submit a proposal to disburse rewards for work up until now. Doing that for the proposals is easy but to reward work that did not result in a proposal we will need to come up with a list. Here is my start, what else?

Comp.vote

I like the idea for rewards of that not included in the vote, but for proposals, COMP/SAI can be granted in the post itself.


As I have stated before, I don’t think rewarding sai is a good idea. First, sai is basically useless; you would need to use it as plain money rather than voting. Two, sai reserves are needed! Sai is still a money market, just has no supplying interest rate. Yes these reserves are growing since people are repaying their debt, but I don’t think that this should be used over comp, especially as one of the big “brandings” for lowering comp speeds in guantlet’s proposal was so it could be used for grants.
Also just for the record I wish that the community multisig not be used for granting comp.",40,63.0,2021-01-20

Much work on the protocol does not result proposals and should be recognized and rewarded through periodic true ups.

I agree with this, and have experienced first hand why this may be valuable.
Back in March last year, when governance had just been launched and didn’t yet have an interface, I quickly scrambled together a (very) basic implementation in a couple days. I figured this might serve as a good starting block in implementing a more legitimate interface, but quickly lost interest as there didn’t seem to be any incentive to continue working on it. Had it been standardized back then that community work may be rewarded, I could have seen myself continuing to iterate over it, eventually creating something with much more significant value.
To be clear, I’m not asking to be compensated for this project, but simply wanted to share why standardizing community work outside of proposals may be valuable in incentivizing community contributions.",34,56.8,2021-01-21

We think there should be incentives for activities that contribute to the Compound!",32,21.4,2021-01-21
['Rewarding Contributors'],"The most expensive aspect of making a complex proposal as a dev is probably paying for audits. Even if the dev is fully reimbursed for the cost of the audit if their proposal passes, they are taking on an uncompensated risk in the case their proposal doesn’t pass. It might be help if there was a way for the protocol to pay a trusted auditor for changes which, e.g. reach the 100,000 COMP proposal threshold, without being contingent on it passing and being accepted by the protocol.
Re: “community improvements” such as comp.vote, I don’t think the proposal system necessarily fits developments that are not direct changes to the protocol. It is expensive and slow-moving, which is fine for changes to code securing user assets, but raises the barrier for other developments. I think a system that drips COMP from a separate stream (separate from the yield farming one) based on community preference (possibly some kind of separate COMP delegation system) would be good at rewarding community developments.",33,36.6,2021-01-21
['Rewarding Contributors'],"While I believe that the SAI should be used to burn/buy comp or at least be changed in some respect.
Lets say that another community multisig with a grants committee shall receive at LEAST 0.05 COMP  a block to be distributed to contributors. I have looked around and seen many impressive projects that never made into reality because of the inadequate economic incentives.",32,21.4,2021-01-21
['Rewarding Contributors'],"Firstly, I think that the sole compensation for protocol efforts should now be COMP. SAI was used prior to the grantComp function, but should no longer be used. I’ll just share my point of view here as I have received multiple “bounties” from the protocol.
We should definitely have some sort of multisig that can distribute grants to non-protocol development efforts. This multisig should also have a part in spurring protocol development, maybe providing help with audits, gas deployment, and minimal compensation along the development process. I think that the major development bounty for protocol changes should still be part of the on chain proposals for the time being.
If anyone has experience running grants committees, maybe we could set one up (think like Uni grant committee). If not, maybe we can go more towards a democratic snapshot voting method? Didn’t put too much thought into this yet, but it is definitely important.",31,76.2,2021-01-25

['Adding Numeraire (NMR) to Compound'],"Proposal to add NMR to Compound:
Motivation:
Participants in the Numerai tournament stake NMR on their predictions to earn more NMR. Participants often want to increase their stake to reflect their confidence that their models will continue to have good performance. However, participants might not be comfortable sacrificing their exposure to other crypto assets to increase their investment in NMR. Alternatively, long-term NMR holders do not receive any interest or return on their holdings. Adding NMR to Compound would match these potential lenders who expect to continue to hold NMR with tournament participants who expect to earn NMR. This would provide holders with a stable return and allow participants to increase their stakes without the opportunity cost associated with selling their other cryptocurrencies for additional NMR.
Background:
Numerai is a new kind of hedge fund built by a network of data scientists. It uses NMR to incentivize anonymous data scientists around the world to collaborate to create predictive models for global equities. It was founded in 2015 by Richard Craib and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. NMR is paid out to participants each week as a percentage of their staked NMR, based on how accurate their predictions were over 1 month of evaluation on live stock market data. NMR is not paid out based on actual hedge fund performance and NMR holders do not otherwise receive any dividend or return based on hedge fund performance.
Comments:
There is high interests from Numerai participants in enabling borrowing NMR. Borrowing/lending is regularly discussed in the Numerai RocketChat: Numerai Community. There are also regular visitors to the RocketChat that express interest in staking on participants’ models because they otherwise have no way to get a return on their NMR holdings.

With the passage of Proposal 033, COMP Speeds are now set through governance (by calling setCOMPSpeed for a given market), and are no longer automatically/dynamically adjusted based on borrowing demand. This is an important change – the community now has the power and responsibility to allocate COMP by market.
The current allocation is a relic of the moment that the proposal went into effect; the COMP Speeds will stay at the current rates, until they are set through governance.
COMP Distribution Speeds1088×1544 67.4 KB
The prospect of governance proposals to modify the allocation is exciting–before the community acts, here are a few guiding questions to shape how this tool is used:

Should the sum of COMP Speeds match the current total,  0.1760? If markets are adjusted individually, should an increase in one market be offset by a decrease in another?
How should important collateral markets like ETH and WBTC, that historically have little borrowing demand, be allocated ? How would this change user behavior?
Should assets that behave similarly be given similar COMP Speeds? Can assets like BAT, ZRX, and UNI, or stablecoins like DAI, USDC, USDT be grouped?
How can the COMP Speeds be used to increase the distribution to more users, and increase decentralization?
Should the community set COMP Speeds infrequently, or actively calibrate them?

At this time, the COMP Speed applies equally to suppliers and borrowers–modifying that relationship would require a significant protocol change.",90,1003.0,2020-12-29
['COMP Distribution Speeds'],"Would it be possible to dynamically adjust comp speeds? For example: borrow rate on USDC is 20% and no new supply is coming in, maybe increase comp rewards for a set # of blocks, possibly scaling every few blocks to sweeten the pot to incentivize people to supply more USDC. This would work for all the markets and would incentivize people to keep reserve ratios at healthy levels.",83,71.6,2020-12-29
['COMP Distribution Speeds'],"My starting point on this would be “if it isn’t broken don’t fix it”. To me the current distribution speed and market allocation seems pretty good. Intuitively it makes sense – markets with higher interest rates receive larger amounts of COMP. I would like to see how the vesting effort plays out before making major changes.
I don’t really want COMP to distort normal market behaviors. So that would mean you always would want the distribution APY to be lower than the market APY The one exception might be the COMP market itself. Distributing more COMP there could be a nice way to reward holders… or it may just get abused by farmers.

Optimizing COMP Rewards
Why?
As Compound pioneered liquidity mining, it is only natural to ask if the distribution of rewards can be optimized. Why might the community decide that this makes sense? Firstly, it is likely — as often happens with market maker and liquidity incentive programs at centralized venues — that an issuer ‘overshoots’ and overincentivizes the either the supply or demand side of a two-sided market. This problem isn’t unique to financial asset incentives, either — even ride-sharing markets like Uber and Lyft are notorious for losing money due to excess payments to both the demand side (riders) or supply side (drivers). In Compound’s case, COMP emissions are used for a multitude of reasons, including but not limited to:

Liquidity Incentives
Paying for development work for the protocol (e.g. Proposal 031)
Paying for risk management and insurance for the protocol (e.g. Proposal 032)
Staking/bonding mechanism for Compound Chain

Given the fixed cap, finite supply of COMP, overspending on one of these components reduces the protocol’s ability to spend on other components. As such, it is prudent for the protocol to optimize how much it spends on liquidity to ensure that other uses of COMP are not drowned out. Moreover, liquidity providers already earn yield from borrowing activities and it is not clear how much of that liquidity would leave without active experiments. However, it is clear that liquidity incentives are one of the best ways to decentralize a protocol and maximize the number of active token holders — which should be taken into account when adjusting rewards.
Let’s do some back of the envelope math to compute how much the protocol is currently spending on liquidity





7 day moving average of the number of blocks produced by Ethereum per day: ~6514.29








Price of COMP:  ~$150 (USD)








Total COMP emitted per block (both supply and borrow sides): 0.352 COMP





This means that the protocol is spending ~$343,954.29 per day or $125,543,314.28 per year on liquidity incentives. Spending ~$125M to attract users is quite expensive! If we approximate the number of users of Compound by the an optimistic estimate for number of active addresses (~300K) that means that the protocol is spending $416.67 per user per year on customer acquisition costs (CaC). These are numbers that would scare any investor outside of cryptocurrency!
How can we optimize incentives?
Numerous other industries that manage two-sided marketplaces, such as ride-sharing, centralized trading exchanges, and gaming, deal with incentive optimization using data science. Given historical data and models for how users behave, market designers can effectively construct A/B tests. These tests could operate in the following manner (stylized and simplified for readability):

At time t, on-chain data and centralized market data is used to make a prediction of how much liquidity will change as a function of incentive (= USD price of COMP * COMP emitted)
This leads to a hypothesis test:

Null Hypothesis: Reducing the COMP emitted to the Dai market by 10% will reduce liquidity by 15%
Hypothesis: Reducing the COMP emitted to the Dai market by 10% will reduce liquidity by much less than 15%


A governance proposal is proposed (akin to Proposal 021) to reduce emissions by 10% to the Dai market
If passed, the data aggregated from monitoring emissions for some time interval T (say, 30 days) will provide us a way to estimate whether the null hypothesis can be refuted or not
New data from the test will be reincorporated into the model (first step) and used to construct another hypothesis test

The literature on designing such trials for online, two-sided marketplaces is vast, but none of this has ever been done using markets with full data transparency, like a DeFi protocol.
How to answer @rleshner’s questions
Part of what we are working on at Gauntlet is something called Automated Governance. This is system that continuously runs simulations (improved versions of those used in the Compound market risk report and in our DeFi Pulse score for Compound) and estimates ‘safe’ and ‘unsafe’ parameter values. These parameter values can be for per collateral protocol parameters (e.g. collateral factors, reserve factors) as well as for COMP incentives.
We propose that all of @rleshner’s questions can be analyzed in a scientific and experimental manner using a system like this for proposing hypotheses. In my opinion, it is impossible to answer these questions for a novel, unique market like Compound without performing some experiments via adjusting COMP speeds. These experiments will naturally be able to tell the community if spending $125M per year is expensive or if it is necessary in the competitive DeFi environment. Moreover, experiments can easily tell us whether these speeds need to be adjusted infrequently or not. For instance, if an experiment to reduce emissions by 10% leads to the null hypothesis staying true, then we have accrued information that suggests that user behavior is insensitive to changes and speeds should not be adjusted too frequently.
Conclusion
The beauty of cryptocurrencies is that their data is completely transparent and public. This means that anyone who has a clever model can test it out without having to spend money on data (like in traditional finance) or harvest user data and make it nonpublic (like a tech company). However, someone has to actually produce this data and analyze it. The only way to do that is via carefully designed experiments whose results can be clearly interpreted, much like a clinical trial or A/B tests in centralized online platforms. Compound led the way by showing that yield farming was a viable methodology for protocol decentralization and it can lead the way in providing scientific rationale for parameter choices in the years to come.

['COMP Distribution Speeds'],"Strongly agree with this. It’s not wise to anchor on the status quo, especially since this distribution was initiated without any foreknowledge of COMP’s price or its effects on lending/borrowing rates. Compound needs a more rigorous way of determining: what is the best COMP emission rate that maximizes the long-term value of Compound. If it’s higher than the current rate, increase it; if it’s lower than the current rate, decrease it.
Sticking with the status quo makes no sense if it was arrived at basically randomly.",62,77.4,2020-12-31
['COMP Distribution Speeds'],"I like Tarun’s idea of experiments to optimize the rate.
And as Tarun also points out, we could reallocate some/much of this COMP to other (perhaps more productive) uses- the forefront for me being development work on the protocol.  For example, using COMP to fund initiatives into new lending products could expand the user base and assets on platform in way that’s more effective and enduring than a COMP distribution to protocol users.  At the very least, it seems like an attractive area to explore.
Personally, I could do without such a large COMP subsidy- it distorts the natural market that forms between borrowers and lenders (ie this protocol is already very useful without the subsidy) and also leads to a lot of unproductive actions within the protocol, such as yield farming.  The distribution is quite expensive and has unclear utility to protocol growth.  Running A/B tests and other such experiments will help quantify that utility to some extent, but I already have a strong hunch that some of that ~$125mm a year in COMP distributions could be better spent on funding/studying new initiatives/products.
At the very least, I’d like to see the COMP distributed adjusted such that Net Borrow Rate > Net Supply Rate for each token (by Net, I mean the rate net of COMP distribution and reserve).  It seems crazy to have positive carry in the same token on the same protocol.",61,67.2,2020-12-31
['COMP Distribution Speeds'],"Very well written, by @tarun but completely based on Hypothesis that COMP is about 150$ and that protocol is spending $ on liquidity incentives.
Reality is that COMP is about 150$ with current market free float. Do you really believe if we, for example, double market free float of COMP right now, price will hold? I sincerely doubt it. In future it might though, if market grows. However from observing current conditions we can also suggest that current release of COMP to market doesn’t move price much, and demand keeps up with selling pressure, which is likely less than daily emission, as some are probably accumulating.
Protocol isn’t really spending any  on liquidity incentives, as it's merely distributing tokens, created from thin air and not really backed with any sort of value and which are 150 only as long as there is a demand at that price.
However, even if we look at COMP from perspective of zero-value token, and merely an utility token for governance, do we think that all tokens, reserved for distribution, should be given out to liquidity miners? I believe not. And that is reason why i believe current structure should be adjusted. And that is also a reason why i believe airdrop to early users should be done as well. Not because i see it as giving out money, but because it’s by far better idea, than just give everything to liquidity miners. They are going to get major share anyway.
So from that perspective i think it’s very reasonable suggestion to decrease emission for dai market by 10% and observe results.
What i would Suggest personally?


decrease daily emission by 10%-20% (That could be taken either exclusevly from dai market, or dai and usdc market)


Use that 10-20% of emission for continious market sell for stable coin/eth/wbtc. Use the proceeds to create treasury. Hypothesis here is: Liquidity farmers are selling good part of daily emission to market and that doesn’t collapse the price. Protocol could as well sell that tokens personally, rather than giving them out to farmers so they could sell and have profits. What protocol should do with treasury? First it should direct that money to reserves of the biggest utilised markets on borrow side until reserves reach at least 1% of supply for every market. It would take quite a time, what to do later after goal is achieved could be decided at a later time. That will greatly derisk markets by seeding a reserves to be used in case of unexpected events, like Coinbase DAI price event. As natural reserves creation is going take forever with current reserve factors. And COMP reserves, are not really reserves as it’s not money until it’s sold, and you don’t now how much you could possibly get for it untill you actually sell. It’s like paper profits. And there’s no difference if supply is limited or not, as certanly it’s very much possible to create COMPV2 with different supply, some conversion rate COMP to COMPV2 and transition governance to new token. So it’s limited only as long as governance agree and want it to be limited supply token. Doesn’t mean it’s set in stone forever and impossible to change. Always nice pitch though, of course 


Redistribute remaining emission, rerouting part of emission for stable coin markets towards ETH and WBTC markets.


Minor markets could be adressed later, but in general i think good approach would be take some percentage of total daily emission, let’s say 10%, and distribute it in equal portions to minor markets and observing the results. (Interesting here is would it boost utilisation or not) I believe there should be minimum portion of total daily emission every market should recieve regardless of utilisation.",67,148.4,2020-12-31
['COMP Distribution Speeds'],"A main reason of having large COMP rewards was to decentralize ownership of the protocol amongst protocol users. This is a major difference for DeFi protocols vs. the traditional comparisons above: customer acquisition cost is not necessarily what should be optimized. The $125m/year is about spreading ownership, not just attracting users. Decreasing the rate of rewards (w/o increasing it elsewhere) slows that down. There may be good reasons to slow down the decentralization, but I’m not really seeing that discussed.
To me, the larger question is: how decentralized is the protocol becoming through the distribution (and how can that be optimized)? There are many ideas floating around about this (like vesting). Ideally, this would also happen to go hand-in-hand with attracting many new users from the distribution and fixing some of the market distortions arising from the current distribution pattern.",60,142.0,2021-01-02

Perhaps we could then just at minimum adjust the velocity of COMP distributed in each market such that Net Borrow Rate > Net Supply Rate for each token (by Net, I mean the rate net of COMP distribution and reserve). By righting these incentives you would be more likely to distribute COMP to folks actually using the protocol for its intended function vs sending it to folks who are yield farming or trying to get free carry.  Note that the COMP distribution economics in this adjusted case would still help decentralize the protocol, make the yield for lending better, and also  subsidize the cost of borrowing- just not so much it borders on a handout for those who lever up on both borrowing & lending simultaneously.",64,37.8,2021-01-05
['COMP Distribution Speeds'],"Great set of comments & opinions–
@johndoh this is how the distribution originally functioned; it scaled the COMP allocation as a function of the interest rate in each market. It was very easily gamed, as users/farmers attempted to use whichever market already had the highest interest rate; first, USDT, then BAT, then DAI. It’s possible that this model combined with vesting/cooldown (Gauntlet is doing fantastic work there) could be viable.
@Sirokko and @aklamun bring up an extremely important point, which is that the distribution was originally (and still is?) intended to distribute COMP to users that want to be long-term stakeholders in the protocol; to participate in governance; not to “farm”. Changes to the protocol or market allocations that decrease the distribution to “farmers” and increase them to “users” (also to @lay2000lbs point) fit this goal.
Increasing the allocation to the large collateral assets (ETH, WBTC) and COMP (and in part, away from stablecoins that could lead to recursive leverage) could begin to achieve this.
And to @tarun and @haseebq’s point–the community should prepare to experiment, improve, and adjust the COMP distribution to best achieve it’s goals.
Taking all of this together, and speaking with a number of you in Discord, I’ve tried to synthesize a “baseline” set of allocations by market, which we can then run experiments against.

This baseline:

Maintains the current total distribution (0.1760)
Creates a modest allocation to the primary collateral assets (which didn’t exist previously due to a lack of borrowing demand)
Standardizes (but doesn’t materially increase) the allocation to secondary collateral assets
Maintains large allocations to stablecoins, while setting DAI and USDC to be equal to eachother as a point of reference for future experiments
Increases the allocation to COMP

['COMP Distribution Speeds'],"@rleshner I do not quite understand how you got the numbers in Supply and borrow, can’t be COMP per day, as if speed is same than it couldn’t be more than current about 2300 total  COMP. But regardless, i’m a huge proponent of simplicity, predictability and ease for understanding, so take a look at my suggestion and below i’ll explain how i arrived to that numbers and some reasoning behind.
I group all existing markets into 3 Categories:

Important Collateral Markets
Important Stablecoin markets
Minor markets

First i took 10% of distribution (0.0176) and distribute it in equal portions to each active market. Which makes 0.00195 per market. That portion just goes there regardless of current utilization of that market.
Next 10% of distribution goes to ETH market
Another 10% goes to WBTC market.
Both of theese markets are important Collateral markets.
Remaining portion is split equally between 2 stable coin markets. USDC and DAI. USDT market is positioned in Minor market because it’s not usable as collateral and thus can’t possibly compete with USDC and DAI at Compound. It’s not going to be big regardless of demand for that token as long as it’s in that state.
There might be arguments that Collateral markets might need bigger share, but we should keep in mind that we already taking away some distribution from stablecoins, we should observe impact and don’t introduce fast radical changes.
As for 50/50 and 75/25 distribution reasoning is. I believe it makes no sense to micromanage exact numbers, as liquidity will always be faster than governance, 50/50 split existed for quite a time, people used to it, liquidity will be easy to adopt and adjust. Could be changed later if needed, but i think it’s a good basis point. At introduction there might be some earning opportunities in minor markets, but i expect money quickly to adjust and profitability will balance itself.
I believe we should start with 75/25 for collateral markets, as borrow side of that markets was always on the low side. There might be some arguments that 25% might be too big for borrow side, but that’s for a reason. Here we not just follow market, we creating some initiative to bring more utilisation to that side. Not too much, that’s why it’s not 50/50, but big enough that we could see some interest there. I believe in long run, it beneficial to have somewhat more on borrow side of ETH and WBTC markets.
I believe it’s good simple starting point. Can be easily adjusted from there if need arise.

I would like to throw out an idea on the point “allocations that decrease the distribution to “farmers” and increase them to “users” (also to @lay2000lbs point) fit this goal.”
If we define “farmer” as a user that frequently claims and sells COMP to compound farming returns, cash out, etc., would some sort of distribution model that “punishes” frequent claiming (rather than conventional vesting, more opt-in), be worth considering? Has this been brought up?
I certainly lack the sophistication to model it formally myself, but intuitively, it seems that allowing some level of farming activity to subsidize liquidity (to some degree), while at the same time rewarding users who accumulate COMP (and perhaps especially those who vote with it) fits the goal of shifting distribution from farmers -> users.
The “punishment” (/pentalty) for the “farmers” (however that makes sense to codify, certainly lots of ways to do that… e.g. carry traders, frequent claimers, etc.) could even be distributed to treasury.",53,30.6,2021-01-05

['COMP Distribution Speeds'],"@mrhen It’s indeed important to properly define things, so we could clearly understand each other. In case of COMP farmers, as i define it it’s an activity of supply/borrow  assets to Compound in that way, that it generates positive net flow achieved by selling distributed COMP tokens, measured in USD while minimising the volatility risks at same time.
Good example of that strategy will be, for example supplying DAI and borrowing DAI at same time. Normally that operation makes no economical sense, as borrow rate you will be paying will be higher than supply rate that you recieve. However, if you account for COMP distribution, you have positive cash flow. For small users it makes not much sense, as returns aren’t that huge, but if you throw bunch of millions, you arrive to quite a steady profits.
Of course, farmers are indeed users of Compound too, problem is that they not really bringing much value to protocol aside of high numbers, which could be called a sort of expensive advertisement. As if i bring for example 10 millions and borrow back 6-7 millions from that, i’ll draw high numbers on both sides, but actual liquidity i provide doing that is much smaller.
So, it’s not really about selling COMP or holding COMP, it’s about using Compound specifically for the purpose of capturing that distribution by activity, which isn’t profitable without that distribution.
Sold COMP to market isn’t really a problem for protocol. For every seller there is a buyer. COMP is just being redistributed from those who don’t want it, to those who want. There’s nothing wrong with that process. It doesn’t look like being huge impact on price valuation either.
I don’t see the need to “fight” or penalise farming, as well as i believe vesting, isn’t really that much needed aside of vesting for initial venture capital… And that’s not to discourage development of vesting. Any development is great, as others might see utility where i don’t see one. And certanly the more instruments protocol could utilise, the better.
I personally see vesting (and by that i mean basically delaying a COMP distribution by a certain period) as a proved inferior solution. I think it’s quite observable from other projects in DeFi, that “staking” works much better. In quotes is because while term is widely used in DeFi, it’s nothing to have with “proof of stake”. Basically usually it’s simple timelock of token in smart contract to collect more rewards.
That could be done in similar manner for COMP and it could recieve some portion of new distributed COMP if there is a need to provide incentive for holding COMP. That’s quite common workable solution in DeFi. Question here is what sort of benefits it can bring to protocol?
Frankly, i’m much more concerned by lack of reserves in pools in comparison with TVL. Preparations for rainy days are usually done far before rainy days actually arrive. But that’s another topic of discussion.  Here we talk about Comp distribution adjustment, which is quite a priority since auto-adjustment is removed already.",51,15.2,2021-01-05

I agree with this reasoning generally.  However, in the context of yield farming COMP to sell on exchange, Compound is punting on letting the protocol benefit economically from this sort of decentralization.  For example, if the yield farmer is just going to flip the farmed COMP, why not instead have the protocol just sell COMP directly via DEXes or something of the like?  That way the protocol could diversify its COMP to other tokens (through the COMP sale for another asset/token) while also decentralizing COMP governance to whoever purchases the sold COMP on DEX.
And so, if there was a policy we could enact to reduce COMP distributions to yield farmers while keeping reasonable COMP incentives for actual “real” users of the protocol, we could then route the saved COMP to exchange to still diversify ownership but also diversify the Compound protocol treasury.",41,28.2,2021-01-06
['COMP Distribution Speeds'],"I’m with you on that also. I indeed think that it would be more beneficial for protocol to reduce emission of COMP by 10-20% and use it for direct market selling of COMP instead to seed a reserves for pools.

I already suggested that on several occasions, but to have discussion more focused i’d suggest deciding on one thing at a time. Yes, reserves are important, treasury is important. Yet, shaping initial frame for new COMP distribution is important too. It’s not very productive and more difficult for everybody to understand if we will try to fit everything in one single proposal.
I presented my suggestion about new distribution. Robert also suggested one. They are quite similar in numbers, but i believe mine is more clear about how numbers are delivered. Maybe you have some comments on suggestions on that? Might be you see a better model? Better distribution?

I’m sure if people would give more participation and supply their reasoning, something better can be shaped, rather than just waiting untill somebody create a proposal with what they think is the best, just because there is literally no other suggestions.


I hear you on that and apologize for not translating how ideas would percolate down to a distribution speed or a proposal that closely ties to the topic thread.  That is good feedback. I’ll try to run some calculations in the coming days/weeks on how this overlay policy of Net Borrow Rate > Net Supply Rate would affect yours & other speed suggestions.  I have multiple kids in diapers and no childcare right now, so haven’t had much free time to do the level of work I’d like to do on this.  May take a bit longer  to get back with firm numbers.
I should also re-note, I’m coming around to the idea that it would be fine for current Net Borrow Rate < Net Supply Rate, provided COMP vesting will happen in such a way that the user has to take a non-trivial price drift risk in the COMP component of the yield.  It is likely a superior way to reduce farming because it avoids adding another rule to the COMP speed system that may require relatively frequent adjustments/votes (since COMP price and other protocol variables would likely affect the Rates too often).",41,63.2,2021-01-09
['COMP Distribution Speeds'],"


 lay2000lbs:

Intuitively it makes sense – markets with higher interest rates receive larger amounts of COMP.


Correct me if I am wrong, but here exists opportunity cost for Ethereum (example). Eth has a low-interest rate and that can disincentivize Ethereum holdings on the protocol (because of staking yield). I think a high LTV ratio is not enough incentivizing for holding because of volatility and aggressive liquidation mechanism.
It would be more logical to reduce the incentive to stablecoins on the deposit and lending side because they have a high-interest rate on holding and borrowing anyway. Perhaps this would partially solve the problem with - “stablecoin leverage farming” in which I see no point other than fictitious TVL pumping.



 rleshner:

Should assets that behave similarly be given similar COMP Speeds? Can assets like BAT, ZRX, and UNI, or stablecoins like DAI, USDC, USDT be grouped?

This means that the protocol is spending ~$343,954.29 per day or $125,543,314.28 per year on liquidity incentives. Spending ~$125M to attract users is quite expensive! If we approximate the number of users of Compound by the an optimistic estimate for number of active addresses  (~300K) that means that the protocol is spending $416.67 per user per year on customer acquisition costs (CaC). These are numbers that would scare any investor outside of cryptocurrency!

['Temperature Check🌡 Meta-Proposal to add PcUNI to cUNI Snapshot'],"The PoolTogether team and @arr00  would like to propose to add the PcUNI token to the cUNI Snapshot.  PcUNI holders are supplying UNI to Compound through PoolTogether.
PoolTogether is a no-loss lottery built on Compound.  Several weeks ago a UNI prize pool was launched, and now PoolTogether supplies ~1.14% of UNI in the Compound Market.  If PcUNI was added as a voting token, it would be easier to reach the 10% quorum on Snapshot as required by the Community Multisig. Users of PoolTogether would be able to participate in Uniswap Proposals thanks to Snapshot and the multisig.
Users of PoolTogether deposit UNI in exchange for PcUNI tokens.  They are exchanged at a rate of 1:1.  They would need to be weighted to match cUNI, but @arr00 says it’s straightforward to do.
COMP holders voted in proposal 29 to delegate market UNI to a multisig that votes according to a cUNI Snapshot vote.  We believe the spirit of this proposal is preserved, as PcUNI holders are cUNI holders by close proxy.
We think it makes the most sense to create a Snapshot meta-proposal for the cUNI token holders, so they can decide whether to approve of PcUNI voting.

Furthermore, practically speaking it would be quite hard to reach quorom on a cUNI vote because all PcUNI holders would be disqualified!

"['COMP Contributors, Grants, Bounties, DAO']","Hello, in light of the recent posts by Leshner, probing into economic research of the compound protocol does not have an efficient process in which to produce or procure quality non-CS/Blockchain research. While Gauntlet and Dharma labs and a few other firms have been able to provide significant development and blockchain research, I feel like compound has not significantly delved into developing a single, cohesive economic model in where comp farmers/ contributors and users can all agree and rely upon.
It has become incredibly apparent that the protocol is now need of better process of rewarding its contributors and those who help develop the protocol.
In the past, when a contributor wanted to claim a bounty, they would have to put the grant within the governance proposition itself. Some examples are,
“The last two calls withdraw from the cSAI reserves about $5000 worth of SAI and sends it to Arr00 as a bounty for organizing and implementing this proposal.”,
“The last two actions take 622 Sai (currently valued at $1200) from reserves and transfer them to Arr00 as a bounty for his work on this proposal.”
Now I do not see an inherent issue with asking for a grant within a governance proposal, I feel like it may be incredibly inefficient to do so.
In the past month or so, several governance proposals have passed in attempt to allow for a better framework in which to reward contributors, including,
_grantComp: An ability for Governance to pay a particular amount of COMP to a specific address.
_setContributorCompSpeed: An ability for Governance to stream a grant to a participant.
Compound Autonomous Proposal, a way for an address with over 100 COMP to deploy and slowly gain votes to pass a governance proposition.
(This can be used to regulate the “rules” and members of the team)
These contributions now allow us to create a committee, or a new DAO, like Uniswap grants, or some other as well. (Cited)
For the time being the governance should pass a resolution to stream and grant COMP towards a multisig wallet, filled with a small handful of pre-selected individuals who will oversee the grants process.
Right now, the comptroller contract has over 100,000 comp and grows at 0.148 COMP / block. How much, if not all should be transferred to the multisig for community distribution?
What kind of rules and bylaws should the team be held by?
Who should the members be on the council? Should they be elected by the CAP, or set up from the beginning proposal?
What should their budget be?
While I personally have some answers to these questions, I would love to hear some community feedback for this.

DAI Market Risk Ideas


    This is a dedicated thread for the community to discuss potential changes to the Compound DAI market. See the main thread  for information and analysis of the liquidation event. 
Background 
The DAI market on Compound has been growing for months as a result of the COMP Distribution; it currently accounts for 309,178 of 427,880 COMP distributed to users. 
With 1.56 billion DAI supplied to the protocol, and 1.20 billion DAI borrowed, the Compound Dai market eclipses both the underlying DAI market,…
  





COMP Distribution Speeds Governance Process

With the passage of Proposal 033, COMP Speeds are now set through governance (by calling setCOMPSpeed for a given market), and are no longer automatically/dynamically adjusted based on borrowing demand. This is an important change – the community now has the power and responsibil…
  





Reserve Factor Standardization Ideas

Reserves are taken out of interest paid by borrowers, and reduce the corresponding supply interest rate in the market. Reserves accumulate in each cToken contract, and can be deployed by the Governance process for any variety of use-cases.

first of all let me say that I find it great that a forum like this exists as it really helped me understands details that were totally unclear for me only a few weeks back.
I would be even more grateful if you could explain to me what happend to my (compound) DAI yesterday. I few days ago I had put DAI worth roughly 14.500 USD as collateral on compound. Along with some COMP. At the same time I borrowed some ETH. See screenshot. Then on January 3rd this happend:



Ethereum (ETH) Blockchain Explorer

I have two questions:

Why did that happen? Was that kind of a margin call?
Why was that sale so very expensive? Transaction fee of almost one ETH, which ist roughly 10% of the sales value)?

PXL_20210103_192943079~23676×1594 1.64 MB
SORRY for my total beginner questions! I am fascinated by Compound but I want to understand what went “wrong” or what I had differently. Thanks in advance!!",30,51.0,2021-01-04
['Margin call? And why was the transaction fee so high?'],"That was liquidation. (Yes, kind of margin call)  Why it happened? Because at the time of liquidation your borrowing position reached your borrow limit due to very fast rise in price of Ether. You should not allow your borrow side to reach 100% of your limit as at that very moment you will be marked for liquidation and WILL be liquidated, even if it in reality will be just very short spike and price will go back shortly after. ETH and BTC are in bull market recently and able to have very big price movements in extremelly short timeframes. For that reason if you borrow ETH against stablecoin, 80% is very dangerous position, it’s nowhere near safe. It’s quite risky to have it above 50% actually. Luckily for you, Compound allows only 50% of a position to be liquidated and liquidation fee is less than 10% also, so you end up in better position than those leveraged traders on bitmex and similar services, but you will still lose some money on liquidation, so in your best interest is to not let it happen.

As for gas fee, it’s not that much depends on liquidator. High volatility of ETH price commonly happens together with spike of transaction fees. You have to pay a lot of fee to make transaction pass through during that period. There are also some risks for liquidators, technically transaction might be frontrunned by somebody else, and liquidator ends up paying gas fee and having transaction not executed, so they commonly overshoot by big margin in terms of gas fee, to make sure they execute fast and first. In your case he could probably get it done for half the price, but liquidation it’s not a situation when you want to be cheap and someone do it before you.

Generally nothing went wrong, you kind of put yourself in risky position by not letting enough room for ETH price to go up. When borrowing high volatility asset against a stable asset, try to leave very big margin, certanly not going to 80% of borrow limit, unless you doing it for a very short time. For any type of long term borrowing you should keep utilisation much lower. Hope it explains.",25,25.0,2021-01-05

–>Idea: the Compound Community should accept $BAT from the BRAVE network to offset our cost
Observation: My payment from BRAVE in $BAT to Compound.Finance based on my web-use was not successful because, “This creator has not yet signed up to receive contributions from Brave users. Any tips you send will remain in your wallet until they verify.”
Question: Any reason why we do not have a connection with BRAVE and we do not collect $BAT?
Proposed Action: The $BAT we earn could fund things Ive read about in other posts:
A) Being Carbon Neutral
B) Giving back to Early Investors
C) Code bounties
Final Statements: BRAVE users generate $BAT for watching advertisements. I estimated I would have contributed one tenth of one $BAT. Its not much on my own but its a new source of revenue for our overall goal, which is community development.
Currently, all the $BAT that I allocated/tipped to Compound has been returned to my wallet. (The one tenth from Compound + other websites).
Overall, I have collected and been returned 3 $BAT from all of the websites I use. The gas prices are not currently worth reinvesting 3 $BAT but if any portion of that amount were Compounded from myself and others, that could offset our GAS charges towards other investments.

Dont we ultimately have the same goals? De-Fi? Decentralization?
But more importantly, we could earn $BAT from BRAVE users that do not use COMPOUND.
Someone just passing through, perhaps reading about us before deciding to start, would earn us $BAT.
I dont necessarily see a down side to that; the community would receive monthly money from at least my traffic. (It currently returns to my account, which is “fine” but I am also okay with giving back)
In the BRAVE user side, why would the BRAVE users tip anyone?
The idea is BRAVE users “opt to pay” for things BRAVE users like. I would tip if we opted for carbon-neutrality or periods of lower gas fees. Nobody would feel their “tip” towards extracurricular events is unfair–because nobody is forced to “tip”.
People sometimes give more when they have the option to/not. Even if nobody donates…we are in the same position we are in now. You all know youll have at least me; my controbution compounded at .01% + cost adjustment for the price of the coin in 50 years. 
I would love to return the favor to to our community by “tipping” if this community helps me become financially independent.
Offsetting the GAS fees for the next-generation with decades of $Compounded-BAT is possible.
Websites such as BlockFi and NEXO do essentially the same thing COMPOUND does, but COMPOUND is much more expensive to use. I understand how COMPOUND is different in our community establishment–but somebody new to Crypto isnt yet looking for what we offer. Someone new to Crypto is looking for cheap and easy.

I wouldnt know how to send/receive directly to COMPOUND either however, there seems to be a body that is “in charge” of Compound.

Together, we’ll develop standards for introducing complex changes—but until you’re completely satisfied that a proposal introduces little technical risk, fight against it.” Who would pay that?",38,7.6,2020-11-07
['Contributions from Brave Users'],"Hey, Chris, look you really have your mind preoccupied with your idea, which is good thing, but it’s really look like very long explanation to answer you, judging from your question.
Compound website and Compound protocol is very different things to begin with. Website is just a user interface really, it’s not really necessary for it to even exist for people to be able to interact with Compound, you also can use a lot of other interfaces, build and provided by other people or teams to interact with Compound.
Brave rewards is there to reward creators and owners of websites. So technically you can reward owner of compound website and they might use it to like pay for hosting or whatever, but it’s up to them really. Accepting donations might complicate tax management, and might very well be not worth it. Like it could create more work than provide benefit and thus not being efficient.
In any case though, you can reward owner of website, but you can’t reward Compound protocol. It’s different things. website owner is entity, either person, or a company. Protocol is a code on Ethereum. It’s not a entity.
I’m not sure what you mean by “offseting a cost”, as Compound doesn’t charge you anything to interact with it. If you speak about Ethereum network fees, that are not payed to Compound, that is payed to ethereum miners, to actually process your transaction. To make it simple to understand, like for example, you want to deposit some money, like let’s say 1 eth to Compound. That’s how it works basically: You need to send a message to Compound contract that you (your address) want to deposit 1 eth. So you go to a website and press some buttons, and basically website just generate that message for you and present it to your wallet, so you can put your signature on it. Than after you sign it, than wallet send that message to miners so they can process it. That’s when your fee is charged, when miner let Compound contract to process your message, get results and include that in block on blockchain. This fees have nothing to do with Compound itself and have nothing to do with Compound webside either. Both of them don’t charge you anything.
I’d suggest you use bat to reward creators who might actually need and greatly benefit even from small contributions they could get from brave users. Like independent news sites, other content-producing sites out there etc…
Compound is a finacial protocol. It have reserves, growing every day to fund whatever governance find appropriate, as well as really big stash of governance tokens, which do have the value themselfes and can be also used to fund anything. It probably could fund pretty much everything for itself just from own funds. But it also was funded by venture capital to bring it where it is now.
I hope you grasped main idea: it’s not a viable idea to collect rewards from brave. Thing is though, that Compound is decentralised protocol. It’s envisioned to be developed by community, at least i believe that was the idea of founding team. So if you believe it’s very much beneficial, than you can learn how to do it, write necessary code for it, got the approval of governance and see it implemented. I already mentioned where to start:
Website is an interface,  the owner is an entity who can collect rewards from brave and use it however he pleased. You can try to convince owner of compound website to collect that, if they find it interesting. Or you can build your own website to interact with compound, and collect rewards yourself. In both cases it would be nothing to do with Compound protocol itself. In second case, it would benefit you and indirectly protocol, as the more UI (user interfaces) are there to interact with Compound protocol, the better it is for decentralisation.",29,70.8,2020-11-07

['Contributions from Brave Users'],"+1 to @Sirokko’s clarification.
Even though the “passive income” generated from verifying Compound community websites such as https://compound.finance and https://www.comp.xyz/ can’t be contributed directly to the protocol treasury, it’s a no-brainer free money for websites owners (I guess Compound Labs,Inc) to subsidize their operation cost, which in the end, will be paid out from the company’s VC money or Compound protocol’s treasury. So I think one can argue this is beneficial for the protocol and the community as well.

Proposal Part 1:
Around V2 launch:
    - Prohibit new supply and borrow of rep v1

Proposal Part 2:
10 weeks prior to earliest fork date:
    - Set REPv1 collateral factor to 0% (going down 10% every 2 weeks until it’s at 0, e.g. 40-30-20-10-0). Encourage people with v1 to convert to v2.
    - If any REPv1 loans are left, use a high rate to liquidate the position, e.g. 10% interest a day or something
    - Assuming some exchanges have listed it and/or dexes have v2 with sufficient liquidity, add v2 to compound with same collateral rules as v1 with a new cREP contract

2 weeks prior to potential fork date:
    - Upgrade any REPv1 in the reserve to REPv2

The thinking behind this is we can keep it fairly simple (to just two proposals). When v2 comes out it no longer makes sense to be able to do new supplies or borrowing of rep, everyone else should be given time to migrate. There are four months until a fork can potentially happen after REPv2 launches (July 28), so there’s time. After the first proposal is enacted and it’s been a few weeks to see how v2 plays out, I then propose a part 2 which reduces how much people can borrow against rep over time (so as to not cause a bunch of cascading liquidations). Assuming there’s oracles with price feeds for v2 at this point and some of the major exchanges have migrated over, I think it then makes sense to in parallel add v2 with the same rules as v1 to encourage people to easily migrate over from v1 to v2 rep and then resupply or borrow from compound.
Since REP has the ability to fork or split into two assets (rare, has never happened and should never happen but is good to prepare), we should go ahead and address that too. The cREPv2 contract could allow compound governance to vote to migrate REP in the event of a fork. But I don’t think it should for a couple reasons: when a fork happens there’s different REP tokens (different contract addresses too) for each universe of the fork, so to migrate, COMP governance would need to choose the winning fork (before it is known what the winning one is), migrate the cREP contract to it, and hope that exchanges list it immediately post fork (otherwise there’s no price feed to go off of for Compound).
Instead what makes more sense is if a fork did happen in v2, there’s always at least 60 days of warning, so we could follow a similar process to the one above: prohibit new supply and borrow, gradually lower the collateral factor, liquidate existing positions if no one pays them back by the end of the 60 days, and upgrade any remaining REP in the reserve (or just convert it to dai or something to be even easier).
Note: continuing the convo from the prior forum here, borrowed a couple ideas from there re collateral factor etc!
Edit: forgot to add fork date info! After launch it takes 8 weeks for a market to potentially trigger a fork at the earliest, and then 60 days for a fork to actually occur.",75,2070.0,2020-07-17
['Augur Migration Proposal'],my concern is that maybe we should do this faster cause when v2 launches the liquidity of REP(v1) will decreases significantly as users start to migrate and liquidating or repaying a position might become difficult.,57,56.4,2020-07-16

['Augur Migration Proposal'],"++ on the proposal and comments, adding some dates:
Two relevant periods here, the slow dispute process (8 weeks) and the forking period (60 days). They work out to roughly equal timeframes, however the slow dispute process runs in weekly fee window intervals and the forking period is defined by a fixed number of days. Augur v2 introduces fast disputing where someone can post a bond to accelerate the dispute process up to 8 weeks before a fork, then Augur turns on the slow weekly dispute process for the remainder of the time until the forking period begins.
Assuming a successful deployment of Augur v2 on July 28th, 2020, in theory someone could create a market with a near immediate resolution date, post a sufficient REP bond meeting the requirements of the slow dispute process and trigger it to begin in the upcoming weekly fee window.
The cadence of the weekly fee window is inherited from Augur v1, so the earliest date in which the slow 8-week dispute process can begin is July 30th, 2020 at 00:00 UTC. This would then result in the earliest possible forking period beginning on September 24th, 2020 (+8 weeks), concluding on November 23rd, 2020 (+60 days).
Earliest possible event dates:


Slow Dispute Start Date: July 30th, 2020

Fork Start Date: September 24th, 2020

Fork Conclusion Date: November 23rd, 2020

So to Joeys proposal:


10 weeks prior to earliest fork date: September 14th, 2020

2 weeks prior to earliest fork date: November 9th, 2020

['Proposal to Integrate Chainlink Price Feeds'],"This post is response to the recent DAI Liquidation Event and was originally intended to be a response to that thread, but is still awaiting moderator approval so I am posting my comment here on the proposal board.
Compound needs to integrate Chainlink Price Feeds. I am writing this as a daily DeFi user and as someone who only wants the best for the DeFi ecosystem as a whole, especially as the value secured rises. The false liquidation of ~$90M in user funds recently was a serious issue that was directly caused by Compound’s centralized oracle solution which pulls market data from only a single exchange, Coinbase, with Uniswap TWAP used as a backstop. Compound’s price feeds provide data that only reflects a small subset of the total crypto trading market and fundamentally cannot provide sufficient market coverage. This in turn lowers the cost of market manipulation and exposes the protocol to inaccurate pricing from large trades.
Specifically, Coinbase has an extensive history of downtime and flash crashes, so I am surprised this was not immediately seen during development as being a huge single point of failure. Using Uniswap TWAP as a backstop is better than no backstop in this situation, but it introduces a false sense of security as it too can trivially be manipulated (as we saw during this event). This lack of market coverage allowed a malicious actor to manipulate just two exchanges to skew the price data delivered to the Compound protocol and falsely liquidate users and yield farmers using DAI as debt or collateral. The core issues of price feeds without market coverage are covered extensively in this blog post here which provides context about the importance of data quality for oracles.
1533×900 108 KB
Coinbase was the only major exchange that experienced such a drastic price deviation, other major exchanges were unaffected.
However, none of this information I mention above is new, as I have previously pointed out the numerous and specific vulnerabilities in the design of Compound’s oracle that were not and still have yet to be fixed. Here is a tweet thread I wrote on July 21st 2020 on my concerns regarding the Compound oracle and the likelihood of Coinbase experiencing market manipulation/flash crashes, the ability to manipulate Uniswap TWAP, and why taking a simple median across pre-selected exchanges does not solve the issue adequately either. Compound’s price oracles are still highly vulnerable to these issues as we speak, leaving over $3B in user deposited funds at risk of further catastrophic losses, and needs to be fixed immediately. Compound’s price oracle simply does not provide adequate market coverage as it exists today. Moreover, because it requires exchanges to change their API infrastructure to provide signed data that is compatible with Ethereum, the Compound oracle will continue to be inherently limited in the amount of market coverage it can ever achieve.
Chainlink Price Feeds provide an immediate solution to this problem, allowing the Compound protocol to fully mitigate these oracle related issues going forward. Aave, another decentralized money market on Ethereum experienced no price oracle issues during this event or any false liquidations. There is a very simple reason for this; instead of rolling their own oracle, exposing them to wide range of nuanced attack vectors, they simply integrated Chainlink oracles, which has successfully provided Aave users with the true market wide price of both DAI and every other asset on the platform since launch, as well as during this Coinbase/Uniswap outlier flash crash. I implore you to consider the following sections as I describe how Chainlink is resilient to these attack vectors.
Chainlink’s Decentralized Price Feeds are highly accurate and resistant to exchange distortions because they provide full market coverage by using multiple layers of aggregation that smooth outliers and prevent manipulated data from being delivered to smart contracts. This ensures market manipulation on a select few exchanges have no effect on the final data point generated and delivered to contracts. Specifically, Chainlink has three levels of aggregation to prevent the exact issues Compound’s price oracles experienced today.
image1600×457 148 KB

Firstly, Chainlink uses professional data providers (CoinGecko, BraveNewCoin, Amberdata, Kaiko, CryptoCompare, Alpha Vantage, CoinApi, CoinPaprika, CryptoAPIs, and more) who whose entire business model revolves around generating high quality data using refined aggregation methodologies. These data providers produce reference prices for cryptocurrencies that reflect the market-wide price by tracking hundreds of exchanges (both on-chain DEXs and off-chain CEXs), taking into account volume, liquidity, time, and other shifting differences across exchanges, preventing any single source of truth.
Secondly, there are the security reviewed Chainlink node operators (T-Systems, LinkPool, Certus.One, Stake.fish, Chainlayer, Chorus,one, SNZ, Huobi, and dozens more) operated by professional DevOps and blockchain infrastructure teams who aggregate price data from multiple data aggregators and take the median off-chain before delivering the data point on-chain, preventing any single source of truth. These Chainlink nodes are paid for their services in LINK, not only covering their gas costs, ensuring timely and incentivized updates, but providing a source of profit. This creates crypto-economic security by creating a large opportunity cost for malicious activity. Additionally, multiple data providers already operate their own Chainlink oracle node and provide cryptographically signed data.
Thirdly, there are the Chainlink oracle networks (feeds.chain.link) which are on-chain reference contracts that aggregate data from multiple node operators, again preventing any single source of truth. Each Price Feed is updated based on a threshold deviation and a heartbeat frequency, ensuring fresh data that follows market volatility is always available to contracts. These Price Feeds are a shared public good funded by many DeFi projects and already secure over $4B in user funds.

What I am proposing here is quite simple. By integrating Chainlink Price Feeds as the primary oracle solution for the Compound protocol, these market coverage issues simply disappear and users can be assured they will not be falsely liquidated (just as Aave can today). Chainlink already supports all of the price feeds the Compound protocol needs on mainnet and integration would be straight-forward, only requiring a few lines of code (docs.chain.link). Additionally, Chainlink Price Feeds can also be used in replacement of Uniswap as the backstop, providing a much more tamper-resistant solution, though being the primary oracle is ideal as it would completely stop these exploits from occurring and ensure there is no period without accurate data. I am writing this as a concerned DeFi user who does not want to see more user funds falsely liquidated due to entirely preventable oracle issues. We are all in this together and I believe that the DeFi community can come together to ensure all protocols are using oracle solutions that are sufficiently secure for the value they secure.
Please take what I say with consideration as the value locked in DeFi continues to grow in orders of magnitude. By fixing the issue at its source now, Compound development and governance can focus on and innovate around what assets should be listed and the risk parameters, rather than worrying about how to refund users in the wake of another price oracle exploit.",98,724.6,2020-11-28
['Proposal to Integrate Chainlink Price Feeds'],"I think using Chainlink for price feeds is a very good idea. I would also like to add two additional benefits, which would come with the integration:

When adding new coins to Compound you are not limited to the coins which are offered by the Coinbase API. Chainlink offers prices for a much large range of coins.
You are no longer dependent on volunteers to post the current prices to the blockchain, which leads to outdated prices. With Chainlink prices are updated regularly automatically.

I’m not sure we should keep kicking this can down the road.",68,83.6,2020-12-02
['Proposal to Integrate Chainlink Price Feeds'],I whole heartedly agree that the liquidation event was caused by a fundamental lack of market coverage from the Compound oracle.

['Proposal to Integrate Chainlink Price Feeds'],This is simply the highest quality solution for the long-term. I wonder why it has not already been taken into consideration? Are there any negative implications for Chainlink integration?,62,82.4,2020-12-02
['Proposal to Integrate Chainlink Price Feeds'],"As already stated by ChainlinkGod above, Chainlink’s multiple forms of data aggregation at the data source, individual node response, and oracle network level will provide Compound with the strong levels of market coverage needed to mitigate price oracle attacks as experienced by the DAI liquidation event. Outside of the technical considerations around better market coverage, I think there are a few other benefits from integrating Chainlink that the Compound community should consider, which can help Compound scale to support larger lending markets across a wider array of assets, both at a cheaper price and with broader community support.


Chainlink provides an oracle solution that is already live on mainnet and proven to secure major protocols like Aave and Synthetix over an extensive period of time. As such, Chainlink can be quickly integrated across all of Compound’s existing markets to swiftly fix this price oracle vulnerability, saving the community considerable time, money, and mental energy that would otherwise be spent thinking about, debating, building, and testing an in-house solution that isn’t guaranteed to be successful.


Compound will undoubtedly look to scale to support more assets in the future and potentially even go beyond traditional cryptocurrencies/tokens, such as digital commodities, NFTs, and more. Being able to quickly innovate and launch new markets will be important to all DeFi protocols as a means of retaining and growing market share in an increasingly competitive environment for yield. By offloading oracles to Chainlink, which specializes solely on oracles and has both a strong academic research team to continually innovate better oracle solutions and a full-time engineering team to ensure all projects have round the clock internal and external monitoring, Compound can focus on its core business model of lending/borrowing and launch more markets across a variety of different asset classes at an accelerated rate. This will help Compound retain its position as the leading lending protocol in an increasingly competitive DeFi market, which is only going to continue as traditional players enter and vie for market share.


With Chainlink Price Feeds already being widely used by the DeFi ecosystem, they offer a shared cost model where a variety of independent protocols/projects collectively support and fund commonly used price feeds. For example, the Chainlink ETH/USD Price Feed already has 26 projects collectively using and supporting it. This financing model lowers the per-user costs as more users join the network, which is likely to rapidly increase as Chainlink continues to be adopted across a variety of use case verticals and blockchain networks. This extends the shared cost model beyond just Ethereum projects, but to projects operating across all blockchains. Also, the Chainlink team has expressed their intention of employing a decentralized governance model in the future, in which Compound could and should clearly have a voice in should they integrate Chainlink.


Integrating Chainlink doesn’t mean that Compound has to remove its circuit breaker mechanism either. Compound can integrate Chainlink as its primary oracle solution, with its own oracle mechanism and/or the Uniswap oracle serving as its circuit breaker protection against the outside chance that Chainlink experiences any issues. This way Compound benefits from the market coverage that Chainlink provides, while still retaining the circuit breaker safety net should the community feel it’s important to keep in place. As such, Compound gets all the benefits of Chainlink, with the added guarantee that at the very least it won’t be any less reliable than your circuit breaker.


While I know there has been some competitive energy between the Chainlink and Compound communities that may at times rub some people the wrong way on both sides, I think ultimately we are all in this together and have a lot of shared interests in seeing DeFi succeed as a whole as well as the success of each other’s protocols. Having been a part of the LINK community for a while, one thing I do know is that they are quick to put the past behind and support teams entering the Chainlink ecosystem, even if there was bad blood or mixed feelings beforehand. While the LINK Marines may be a little eccentric at times, I think the Compound protocol could benefit from the LINK community’s passionate energy as a means of furthering Compound’s brand and awareness as a leading on-chain money market. This clearly benefited Aave, as upon its Chainlink integration they were able to innovate quickly and grow in market share/awareness, with LINK becoming the largest market by value locked. Not only do I believe that Compound could benefit from this Link Marine effect, but I think it’s a perfect way to launch a LINK market on Compound that has a chance of being immediately adopted by a community with deep knowledge in the DeFi space and the funds to engage in these protocols. LINK is increasingly being seen as a reliable form of collateral, but the LINK community tends to only trust protocols that use Chainlink to secure their oracles.


In short, I think such a collaboration between the two would benefit both ecosystems. Compound could innovate / launch new markets faster, obtain more price oracle security, and utilize social support from the LINK marine community to help it reach wider audiences. At the same time, Chainlink could clearly benefit from supporting Compound, as Compound is undoubtedly an OG in DeFi, secures a large amount of value, and has a community of many smart and innovative thinkers that could contribute to the continued development of Chainlink to the benefit of both projects. While competition may be intense at times, it’s drawn from the passion and drive both communities have around winning, and I think combining those two forces would lead to an accelerated amount of winning for both ecosystems than what would otherwise occur as separate entities.",60,52.0,2020-12-03

This is something I am seriously worried about, because as  Compound grows in TVL alongside the rapid growth of DeFi, the incentives to manipulate the oracle mechanism grows as well.
Chainlink provides an immediate solution today and there is really no downside because the Compound community can always revert back if it doesn’t end up working for whatever reason, but the status quo of doing nothing does not fix the issue at hand. Even if every exchange begins cryptographically signing their APIs (an idealistic but monumental and time consuming task), it still wouldn’t provide proper market coverage because taking a simple median across exchanges doesn’t take into account volume and liquidity differences like the data aggregators Chainlink uses do, which is required for actual market coverage.
The autonomous proposal can even keep Uniswap as the circuit breaker to protect against black swan events as it does today, providing the best of both worlds (Chainlink for full market coverage and Uniswap as an always-on circuit breaker).

Fix the Compound oracle problem Ideas


    The so called “DAI liquidation event” has shown, that the open oracle, which is used by Compound, has weaknesses. The root cause is, that the oracle uses only one price source, which is Coinbase. The effect is, that the Coinbase prices are used in Compound, even if they deviate largely from the rest of the market. The Uniswap price is used to define a +/- 20% bounding, but as seen, this doesn’t solve the problem.

As I already explained to you here, none of these claims about Chainlink is true. I will repost my comment here to provide context to everyone.
This is simply not true and a bit disingenuous. Chainlink simply wants to provide the DeFi ecosystem with the most secure price oracle solution with the highest quality data and this involves pulling from data aggregators who have full time monitoring teams to ensure manipulation is prevented 24/7. Taking a simple median from a select few exchanges is simply not an adequate oracle solution as it will always be vulnerable to market coverage issues and manipulation attacks around volume shifts and consolidations. As I described in the post linked above, the three layers of aggregation (data level, node level, network level) prevents any single source of truth. Relying on a single source of true is what played a significant factor in the $100M false liquidations of Compound users, and at the very least made the attack much easier and cheaper to pull off.
These are not “unnecessary layers” but layers of redundancy to ensure smart contracts always receive price data that reflects the true market wide price and not that of a single or a few exchanges. As I described in my proposal, Chainlink is directly secured by cryptoeconomics through an opportunity cost of losing future income if a node is malicious, as well as losing their reputation as an DevOps infrastructure provider. This is why we have never seen a successful attack against the Chainlink network, because the incentives work and ensure correct data is always posted on-chain.

With regards to improving the Open Oracle, the path forward is to add more high-liquidity exchange reporters to the current oracle view. This should not be the highest priority action, as it does not address the security issue at hand which can only be resolved by reducing the amount DAI outstanding debt in the system.


As I also described, taking a simple median across a select few exchanges who change their infrastructure to support signed data compatible with Ethereum still does not provide adequate market coverage because it doesn’t take into account volume and liquidity differences across exchanges like data aggregators do. Here is a repost of my comment for more context.
I think you’re missing the key point of market coverage. The issue with Compound’s oracle during this DAI manipulation attack was that it did not report the true market wide price. If an attacker manipulates the entire market (across every single exchange), then yes all oracles would be affected at that point, but that’s only because the true market wide price was changed, but that’s not what happened during this event, only a single exchange (Coinbase) was manipulated. That’s the nuance here, market coverage raises the cost of attack to highest degree possible, and while it doesn’t prevent market manipulation altogether, but does make it as expensive as possible and ensures protocols always receive the true market wide price.
Like we discussed at length in the governance discord channel, the DAI liquidation event was a mixture of two factors. Too much DAI debt taken out AND a lack of price oracle market coverage. Coinbase is not the only liquid market for DAI and the DAI/USD Coinbase trading pair only tracks 4.75% of DAI’s daily volume according to CoinGecko. The vast majority of the volume is from Uniswap, which Chainlink adequately tracks today through its usage of data aggregators. Both of these factors (debt and market coverage) need to be solved, but we shouldn’t be ignoring the latter whatsoever. We can solve both issues at the same time, because market coverage played a significant factor in the false liquidation of $100M in user funds. The longer the Compound protocol goes without ensuring market coverage, the more exposed user funds are to further oracle manipulation.",54,45.8,2020-12-04

 wario:

With regards to improving the Open Oracle, the path forward is to add more high-liquidity exchange reporters to the current oracle view.


If only alot more high-liquidity exchanges had/adopted the open oracle reporting api. Seems your solutions is to make this high liquidity exchanges provide tooling for us, what incentive is there for them to spend resources for this?? I know coinbase has, because they’re an early investor to compound.



 wario:

his should not be the highest priority action, as it does not address the security issue at hand which can only be resolved by reducing the amount DAI outstanding debt in the system.

Adding layers of obfuscation to what should be a simple and transparent oracle design is detrimental to security. I’ll restate what I’ve said numerous times before “Full market coverage” is a silly idea, in reality most markets are low volume/liquidity and a lot of CEXs have fake volume and liquidity. You want to be very careful in selecting what markets to include in a price feed, and medianizing the set of carefully selected high-liquidity exchanges is the best possible way to do this.
A bit off-topic, but It’s qiute lamentable, and time-consuming, that this industry has to deal now with a clear and obvious campaign of aggressive astroturfing by a company to promote a subpar technical solution constantly and everywhere. The arguments on this topic have become repetitive and tiresome, so I’ll just leave it at that.",49,69.8,2020-12-04

The Chainlink network doesn’t obfuscate anything, but is incredibly transparent into its operation (feeds.chain.link, market.link, reputation.link). The usage of data aggregators ensures price data tracks all trading environments, preventing market coverage issues and this includes tracking fake volume and market manipulation. You want multiple layers of redundancy to ensure there is no single point of failure.

I’m not going to repeat myself on the importance of market coverage because Chainlink has already proven its ability to properly secure a wide range of dApps like Aave and Synthetix for long periods of time, which have never experienced market coverage or data quality issues like Compound did. This isn’t a Chainlink shill, this is “please fix your oracle before it breaks again and users lose more money” plea that’s coming from someone who has seen these oracle manipulation issues time and time again. Taking a median across exchanges where volume can shift overnight to exchanges not being tracked doesn’t solve the problem.",53,70.6,2020-12-04

As a user, I want to make sure that I’m protected from this from happening in the future and that my positions aren’t liquidated when they should not have been.
Chainlink had better market coverage, which is obvious because it did not report this crazy DAI price. The bottom line is Compound’s current infrastructure got us here, and something needs to change.

All nodes are run by known, established entities and you can see each price update they post on-chain. It’s not like they can post prices then hide from everyone, as they would be immediately identifiable. Full market coverage also doesn’t mean you are just taking an average of all exchanges. It means you are taking in data from all exchanges and then weighting it by volume, while also removing outliers, fake exchange volume, etc. By having such a setup, you can account for volume shifts between exchanges or if it starts flowing to a new exchange. This is much more scalable and doesn’t require constant shifts in the underlying price calculation to account for changes in the trading market.
Also, Compound can still keep a circuit breaker in place should they want a fallback mechanism, similar to what they have today in Uniswap.",53,105.6,2020-12-05

Tarun Chitra - Update on Gauntlet’s COMP vesting proposal (starts at 1:30)

Tarun provided an update on the COMP vesting proposal, which is currently in the final stages of development. The current implementation has a high level of complexity, so the Gauntlet team is working on a second, simpler implementation that will also need an audit. There will likely be a UX change on claiming COMP with this new implementation, so the Gauntlet team is looking for feedback on how the UX for COMP vesting should look on various platforms and applications. Feedback can be shared in the #development channel of the Compound Discord (be sure to @Tarun). The Gauntlet team will also be holding a code review session in early January once both implementations are done, so stay tuned for details on joining. Resources: Presentation, PR #71


Jared Flatow - Compound Chain Whitepaper Walkthrough (starts at 12:12)

Jared Flatow of Compound Labs provided an overview of Compound Chain, a stand-alone distributed ledger capable of transferring value & liquidity between peer ledgers. At a high level, each validator on Compound Chain is reading events from starports (smart contracts on integrated blockchains), and signing notices that go out to the various chains. The native unit of account, CASH, can be borrowed from the protocol after posting the required collateral. Right now the Compound Labs team is in the feedback phase, gathering ideas from the community on how to improve the core protocol. The team expects the first version of the testnet to be live in January, which will allow users to borrow and download CASH. On the next version of the testnet, users will be able to borrow other assets on Ethereum. The team is planning on getting security audits in February, at which point the community can decide if the protocol is safe enough to launch on mainnet. Resources: Whitepaper

Hash: SHA256
In order to make way for the vesting changes (which can be found in PR #71), we have pushed PR #83 that adds a few Comptroller optimizations. The biggest changes are:

Removal of automatic claiming of COMP
Removal of automatic changes of COMP speed, replaced by a new _setCompSpeed function that allows governance to directly set the comp speed for a given market

Both of these are followed by other related changes and cleanups that are listed in detail in the pull request (for example: functions to add and drop a Compound market are elided and are instead controlled by setting the COMP speed).
Note that this patch further reduces comptroller size and will save gas for operations that users perform and does not include any code that has to do with vesting.

['Migrate cDai implementation from CDaiDelegate to CErc20Delegate'],"When the DSR (Dai Savings Rate) was introduced by MakerDAO, the Compound team developed a CDaiDelegate to take advantage of DSR (pre governance). With DSR remaining at 0% for such an extended period of time, it would be advantageous for the sake of gas fees to change back to a system which doesn’t enter DSR.
I propose setting the cDai implementation to a CErc20Delegate which is already the implementation for cUSDT which can be found here.
The following are rough gas estimates for a CDaiDelegate vs CErc20Delegate transactions. They are a very naive at just a few of the most recent transactions–a goes on behind the scene, but there is a definite and significant downwards trend.

['DAI Liquidation - Compensation'],"This is a dedicated thread for the community to discuss compensation for users borrowing DAI that were liquidated on 11/25. See the main thread for information and analysis of the liquidation event.
Data

List of addresses liquidated during event

Background

The protocol and documentation (Prices, Docs) clearly describe that the protocol uses the price of DAI on Coinbase Pro, and the protocol contracts all performed as written.
The market price of DAI on Coinbase Pro reached $1.30, triggering liquidations in the protocol for users borrowing DAI.
Impacted users have requested compensation.

Initial Questions

Was the market price of DAI on Coinbase Pro fair? Was it intentional manipulation, or a market dislocation?
Were impacted users aware of the risk?
Do impacted users deserve compensation? Why?
If so, how should compensation be calculated?
If so, should compensation come from reserves, or by distributing COMP?
Does compensating users create a social contract that doesn’t already exist? Does a social contract already exist? How would compensation change the future activity of users?

Other Considerations

All COMP (which there is a fixed supply of) were previously distributed; the protocol has a sizable inventory controlled by Governance, but doesn’t yet have a function to send COMP to an address outside of the use-based distribution; this would require a protocol upgrade. Gauntlet has an in-development branch which includes this feature.

['DAI Liquidation - Compensation'],"I will add another question for everybody to consider:
Here’s an example:
User had 1 Million USDC in his wallet initially.
He Supplied 1 Million USDC to Compound and borrowed 700 000 DAI, using Supplied USDC as Collateral.
Now user has 700 000 Dai in his wallet.
He was liquidated in the event.
Should he be compensated considering amount of liquidation, or considering amount of actual funds he had in Compound, since only 300 000$ of his funds were actually in protocol when liquidation occured?",83,26.6,2020-11-29
['DAI Liquidation - Compensation'],"I think we need analysis on this question: “Was the market price of DAI on Coinbase Pro fair? Was it intentional manipulation, or a market dislocation?”
If the market price was fair, I see no reason for compensation. If it was not fair, then we should start a secondary discussion around if / how compensation could work.
My assumption at this point is that it was not fair but also not completely wrong. One way of saying it may be that the price was accurate to the letter of the law but not the spirit of the law.
If this is the case, I think some limited pro-rata compensation based on asset reserves (not COMP) could be in order. I don’t think treating COMP as cash makes sense I think it makes more sense to use protocol reserves for this (starting with deprecated assets like Sai).
Also could we get a number for what the total cost would be if we wanted to compensate all borrowers 100% of their liquidation penalty?",81,106.2,2020-11-29
['DAI Liquidation - Compensation'],"I think that you should back to the begininng - purpose of compound.finance?
Obviously, I did not expect high interest income from my deposit because the interest in Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies is embarrassingly small.
So I decided to choose compound.finance because of the relatively decent LVT ratio of 75% I have on Ethereum. I was borrowed “stablecoin” DAI for the reason that I at least reduced the risk to the volatility of the borrowed funds and I was still at risk of the volatility of Ethereum.
I used Compound.finance to keep my crypto-business liquid and not to create leverage with two stablecoins - which makes no sense to me.
I did not lose USDC in this obvious manipulation but Ethereum.
By your question you have actually admitted that compound.finance has no purpose other than yield farming. Here we lose all the advantages of blockchain and return to the traditional FinTech where you using only dollars - “stablecoins”.",76,35.2,2020-11-29
['DAI Liquidation - Compensation'],"I don’t think it’s hard to conclude that this is a manipulation. Stablecoins are meant to protect you from volatility. DAI jumped 30% on one exchange (accidentally Compounds oracle) in just one hour and returned to normal.

['DAI Liquidation - Compensation'],This was an exploit plain and simple- no different than a synthetic short squeeze. For example if you were short Facebook at $250 and your banker was Morgan Stanley - they tell you if it goes to 350 you have to cover your short. Then one day in Hong Kong there’s a price spike bc of an error or whatever and the stock trades at 350 in HK but never in the USA but ms stops you out and makes you cover and take the loss.  This is even worse bc the person/people responsible knew exactly what they were doing and it was nefarious. People will run from this exchange if there’s no compensation for losses,69,58.8,2020-11-29
['DAI Liquidation - Compensation'],"I am user 0x0be0ecc301a1c0175f07a66243cff628c24db852 , I was liquidated twice, in the first liquidation 76,547,382,213.00 cETH was liquidated from me, and in the second, 48,501,406,899.00.
The liquidator paid back somewhere around 10,000 DAI to seize my $15,000-$20,000~ worth of Ethereum.
1: * Was the market price of DAI on Coinbase Pro fair? Was it intentional manipulation, or a market dislocation? - This, in my opinion, was intentional manipulation. There was no other reason DAI would spike to $1.30 and someone would be instantaneously ready to liquidate.
2: * Were impacted users aware of the risk? - Of course, impacted users were aware that they could be liquidated, but the liquidation rules specify far lower liquidation penalties than we paid, and I was personally absolutely unaware we were using a singular price feed or I would not have been in this market as a singular price feed is well known to be exploitable in this way.
3: * Do impacted users deserve compensation? Why? - YES, but it is not a question of “deserve” compensation, and the fact that anyone has to frame it that way is beyond insulting. Impacted users were severely affected by an exploit in the protocol - and the protocol SHOULD have funds set aside for dealing with these kind of emergencies, outside of just this case or just these users.
In my opinion, a COMP distribution should be offered to these users, acceptance of which is predicated on them giving up all claim to damage. Otherwise, it seems very likely many of them will sue.
4: If so, how should compensation be calculated? - This is an interesting question. In my opinion, it seems pertinent to offer less than the damage. We should look at the percentage of assets that were unfairly seized [IE: 38%], and offer that much as COMP to the affected users. As much as I or the rest of the liquidated users would probably like more, that seems more doable and agreeable to the users who were not liquidated. Therefore we still take a hit in damage, but we are able to walk away with something instead of nothing.
5: * If so, should compensation come from reserves, or by distributing COMP? - Distributing COMP seems more sensible in my opinion than compensating from the reserves. I would honestly prefer to get back ETH because I was saving for a staking node, but that seems less possible than COMP.
Can we get a report that specifies what sort of reserves are available for a liquidation event compensation?
6: * Does compensating users create a social contract that doesn’t already exist? Does a social contract already exist? How would compensation change the future activity of users?
No, it doesn’t create a social contract, but it is demonstrative that we are capable of solving our own problems through governance, and empowers the user base to see the value of governance as not only a mechanism to specify risk parameters, but as a mechanism to truly govern and deal with emergency situations such as this that may threaten the solvency of Compound as an American company.
7: * All COMP (which there is a fixed supply of) were previously distributed; the protocol has a sizable inventory controlled by Governance, but doesn’t yet have a function to send COMP to an address outside of the use-based distribution; this would require a protocol upgrade. Gauntlet has an in-development branch  which includes this feature.

Were impacted users aware of the risk – If we decide to upgrade/improve the oracle system does that mean we acknowledge the current system is inadequate?  It seems our own engineers at compound were not fully aware of the oracle vulnerability, which means many users were similarly unaware.
Do impacted users deserve compensation – there is no explicit requirement for compensation, but the social contract question is pertinent here.  Why do so many other crypto projects reimburse users after an exploit?  Do the affected users have a legitimate shot at class action success if a lawsuit follows?  The cost of reimbursement is a low single digit % of compound market cap.  The cost sounds low in exchange for putting this liability behind the community.

Whether or not the community decides in favor of compensation, I believe the oracle solution must be changed. Yes, CBPRO:DAI-USD was at ~1.30 momentarily, but this was not the price of DAI globally and should not have been treated as such in any price feed.
I was not liquidated, but I know people who were; they should not have been, in my view.

Was the market price of DAI on Coinbase Pro fair? Was it intentional manipulation, or a market dislocation?

I can speak to these questions but lack the knowledge to answer the others.
Here is my address, I was liquidated in the event.
0x196d7a2f4f78a15fc52c35d9d4456db1e0e628d8
First Question: Was the market price of DAI on Coinbase Pro fair? Was it intentional manipulation, or a market dislocation?
As mentioned by @mrhen It seems to me that there was an undeniable and massive market dislocation between the coinbase price (or synonymously the Compound oracle price) and all other exchanges/ oracle services. From this, we can conclude that the price supplied to the compound protocol was erroneous.
Second Question: Were impacted users aware of the risk?
As an impacted user, I would like to describe my experience with compound:
I learned of the protocol about a week ago and did not just dive right in without educating myself. I sought out any and all available educational resources, including the ones provided by coinbase that explain the lending and borrowing protocol and some third party ones as well. Once I felt comfortable with the protocol and knew it inside out, I supplied my eth as collateral and borrowed dai. The compound app provided a suggested “safe limit,” which I made the decision to trust. Had this suggested borrow ratio not been there, I would likely have chosen to borrow less.
Here is the nuance of this question: I was completely aware of the risk associated with borrowing. I was not, however, aware that the oracle used by compound was vulnerable to exploitation. Nor was I aware that the “safe limit” was evidently not safe in the slightest.
Third Question: Do impacted users deserve compensation? Why?
Imo the impacted users deserve compensation. We deserve compensation because we did nothing wrong. I don’t know what ratio the other users chose to use, but I know that many of the liquidated users were being smart with their money. This liquidation affected routine users who were operating within the “safe limit” of the protocol. I did my due diligence and educated myself on the risks involved with using the compound protocol. I am a beginner to the DeFi space and the protocol and app made me feel safe, as it should! It is not a punishable offense to use this protocol within safe operating limits. It is not a punishable offense for new users like me to acknowledge our limits and seek out a protocol like compound that makes things (appear) straight forward.
Users that were using the safe limit feature on compound should undeniably be compensated in full. My (uneducated) opinion is that users that were using more risky borrow-supply ratios should be fully compensated as well in a gesture of good faith and goodwill.",64,117.8,2020-11-29

Was the market price of DAI on Coinbase Pro fair? Was it intentional manipulation, or a market dislocation?
Were impacted users aware of the risk?
Do impacted users deserve compensation? Why?
If so, how should compensation be calculated?
If so, should compensation come from reserves, or by distributing COMP?
Does compensating users create a social contract that doesn’t already exist? Does a social contract already exist? How would compensation change the future activity of users?



I was one of the affected users ,i will try to answer the question you mentioned above .
*Obviously the market price of Dai on coinbase was not fair ,you can look at the price globally and you can easily come to that conclusion , it will be hard to prove if it was an intentional manipulation but i believe it was , and it was a part of a wide attack on the protocol , this vulnerability was highlighted couple of times by the community but actions were not taken to mitigate it until the protocol got exploited . If the protocol need an upgrade to deal with this issue , that means that protocol didn’t behave as it should .
*I was aware of the liquidation risk and i took several steps to avoid been liquidated i never thought the price of DAI will be over 1.2 $ and obviously it wasn’t the case globally , relying on a single price oracle is what lead to my liquidation (aave and maker didn’t suffer any issues)
*Ideally for the compensation we should make the users whole , most of the user missed out on the price appreciation of their collateral .
*I think the compensation should come from the reserves that way COMP holders won’t feel the impact as much, if we were to distribute COMP most comp holders will vote against it since it will dilute their assets
*Compensating users for Protocol malfunctioning will cement Compound as a market leader in the space and it will lead to more trust in the protocol which will most likely increase the number of user and TVL .

I, being one of the impacted users, would like to answer Initial Questions, despite the fact that my answers will be biased. I hope that everybody understands that Compound is used by people with different education and knowledge and not everybody thoroughly studies the technical details of the protocol. That’s the way things are, you cannot be an expert in every field and people just trust, otherwise there would not be such a thing as a reputation. Most customers use the functionality of the protocol based on its reputation and many years of history. Since the protocol was working for many years without any issues and was entrusted with more than 1 billion USD, I have also entrusted it with my money. Of course, you can say that if you do not understand all details then you should not be here. But I would like to know who we build the DEFI infrastructure for. For software developers and technical specialists or for ordinary people after all? When you buy a car you usually look at the ease of operation and you choose a brand you Trust. You do not dive into technical details. And if a manufacturer finds a critical defect, the manufacturer recalls cars and pays compensation to owners. That’s why compensation is very important for the Trust. In the world of cryptocurrencies, where everything is anonymous, Trust is most probably the most important success indicator of any project.(edited)

1. Was the market price of DAI on Coinbase Pro fair? Was it intentional manipulation, or a market dislocation? I think the market price of DAI was not fair.
Being a user and not a technical specialist I would like to refer to the original source. Main page of https://makerdao.com/ The world’s first unbiased currency. Dai is a stable, decentralized currency that does not discriminate. Any individual or business can realize the advantages of digital money. Financial freedom with no volatility A price-stable currency that you control. Generate Dai on your terms, instantly. 1 Dai=1$ When during a short period of time a price of the token that should be equal to 1$, changes by 30% on one source (while at the same time other sources do not confirm such price change) and this leads to positions liquidation, which under normal circumstances should not have been liquidated, then there should be an issue with the Compound protocol. How can I consider the liquidation of positions at this price to be fair?(edited)
[ 3:47 PM ]
Was it intentional manipulation, or a market dislocation? I think that this question is not essential. It could be a hacker attack, Coinsbase failure or any other reason. The fact is that this happened and led to an incident. Other sources did not confirm such a sharp price deviation. If we accept that DAI price was not fair, then anything else is not that important and just helps us to understand what happened but should not be taken into consideration when deciding whether the compensation should be paid or not. Compound team shall focus on fixing the issue and quickly find the solution that will protect people from similar situations. Solving this problem will increase the trust. If nothing will be changed, a competitor, who will fix this problem, will appear and customers will go there since it is safer.
Were impacted users aware of the risk? I think impacted users were aware of the risk according to the knowledge about the token and Compound protocol, but nobody could foresee the risk of 30% DAI price change.(edited)
[ 3:48 PM ]
Do impacted users deserve compensation? I think that impacted users do deserve the compensation. Why? Impacted users were severely affected by an exploit in the protocol, then the protocol MUST… However, I do not agree with this. No one can guarantee anything and we know it. Compound worked as it was programmed. Condition for liquidation appeared and liquidation took place. Some users lost money, liquidators made money, everything is according to the market rules. But Compound is not just an immutable set of code on a blockchain, it is a community: people who use and trust the protocol. The most important point is that people, who trusted Compound and were part of its community, suffered. They suffered by entrusting their money to Compound. Compound gave the opportunity to liquidate their positions at a non-market price. This is result of force majeure caused by an error at the quotes provider, hacker attack, or just a glitch. This happened and part of the community suffered. Users, who suffered, hope that the community will admit that the liquidation was a mistake. Positions should not have been liquidated.
[ 3:49 PM ]
And the community can evaluate this situation and take a decision based not only on commercial interests, but also on the ideas and spirit of DEFI. The global idea of DEFI is to create financial products for people, and Compound is one of the biggest players on this market that builds this infrastructure for the community and is a benchmark for many. I believe that the community should take a positive decision about the compensation because this happened to the part of Compound community. There is no need to look for somebody to blame or the reasons why Compound OWES to somebody, but simply help out. If Compound is not willing to help users, who it builds infrastructure for, then that is wrong. There will be less trust and confidence in such a project. Next time other users might suffer, but they will know that nobody will help them. If there is no trust and confidence in the project, users will start looking for an alternative and leave DEFI, since even market leaders cannot provide safety to its users. If Compound does not support its users, then other projects will adopt the same practice, thinking that why should they if top players do not. Eventually DEFI will become a pyramid where you cannot trust anybody, and everybody wants to grab somebody’s else. I believe that here we have to discuss whether the Compound community is ready to help users in difficult and force majeure situations. I will not give names, but one of the impacted users wrote that it was his last money and I see no reason not to believe him.
[ 3:49 PM ]
If so, how should compensation be calculated? That’s a technical question and calculation of losses for each user is a difficult task that requires a lot of time for analysis. Maybe some basic conditions for estimating losses, for example based on several major liquidations. And then approximate this estimate to other users, for example by linking to the column “DAI Repaid”. Maybe it will not be fair towards someone, but I think that many users do not even hope to get anything and will be happy to accept any positive decision. This will also take less time than to analyze every user out of 142 impacted users. Time in this case is very crucial. How fast the community will be able to mobilize and solve this issue? If so, should compensation come from reserves, or by distributing COMP? In my opinion by distributing COMP, but same has to be discussed with the Board.""",57,91.4,2020-11-30
['DAI Liquidation - Compensation'],"Users should be compensated. This doesn’t seem like it is working as intended, especially since Dai price was trading normally elsewhere. The users that are effected in this incident did not do anything wrong, but suffered. COMP as a leading DEFI platform should try hard to maintain the trust, or else people would just move their funds elsewhere. No one would want to risk their money at a place that is vulnerable to said attack.",54,70.8,2020-11-30
['DAI Liquidation - Compensation'],"I’m sorry but I feel obligated to take the unpopular position against compensation.  I have great sympathy as a fellow human for those who lost money to the incident but I think compensation is a mistake for reasons that I hope I articulate clearly below.

Was the market price of DAI on Coinbase Pro fair? Was it intentional manipulation, or a market dislocation?



Almost certainly manipulation by a liquidator who planned and scripted out the attack in advance.



 rleshner:


Were impacted users aware of the risk?



No, but the cold truth is that in finance, this is immaterial.  The impacted users should have and could have been aware of the risk, and Compound is a protocol that can be used in risky ways. Users have a responsibility to understand the protocol before they put large sums of money in it.  Compound could have done a better job of educating users about these risks but ultimately, any complex financial product, whether in the crypto space or the traditional finance space, has ways to use it dangerously and it is generally impossible to protect people from their own ignorance when using complex financial products.
I certainly think that the idea of a “safe max” to borrow is ridiculous and I do blame the Compound UI for using that term as being part of the problem.  There is no 100% safe amount to borrow of any product.  Some amounts might be 99.99% safe, or 99.9% safe, or 99% safe, or 95% safe, and users need to evaluate this on their own if they are going to short sell a product (I know that not all protocol users realize this, but when they supply USDC and borrow DAI, then keep selling the DAI and supplying more USDC to build up the “recursive” leverage for yield farming, they are short DAI).  DAI is a soft peg and short selling it has counterparty risk against MKR holders because if they mismanage DAI it could actually (as opposed to via an oracle exploit) globally reach prices well above 1 (e.g. if they fail to allow more USDC deposits into vaults once the USDC max supply is reached).  Similarly, being long USDC has tail risks associated with it, e.g. if Circle somehow turned out to be engaging in fraud or had US regulatory action against them (I think this is highly unlikely but I think people should consider and understand these tail risks when they use these products).
In the other thread people have proposed switching to Chainlink oracles, which is clearly an improvement that could have prevented this specific attack, but it still doesn’t prevent all tail risks to using Compound and the idea of there being a “safe” max borrow is still a dangerous and incorrect idea in my opinion.



 rleshner:


Do impacted users deserve compensation? Why?



Sadly, I believe not. I already touched on this in my response to the previous question, but users should understand how a protocol works before using it, including the oracle and the liquidation process.  I have used Compound with DAI but I am very careful about my ratios because even before this incident, if you look at the price history of DAI-USDC on Coinbase (for a long time Coinbase only had DAI-USDC but no DAI-USD, I guess because they wanted to promote USDC and force users to use it) you can see other times in the last year when the illiquid market has resulted in temporary ridiculous prices.  For example the 2019-07-14 candle shows a max price of 1.35 and the 2020-03-11 candle shows a max price of 1.126, so even just pulling up the Coinbase price history would show anybody that they ought to be planning their positions around the possibility of the Coinbase-based DAI oracle printing 1.3.
In fact, I would go so far as to posit that many people people who understand how the oracle works have been cautious with how they use the protocol out of fear of the exact thing that happened occurring, and that part of the reason for the apparently outsized returns offered by yield farming is that maybe you can get a 20% return with aggressive recursive yield farming, just like you can by buying junk bonds, but they also pose non-trivial chances of significant loss of your initial capital.  In reality, if you see something easy that offers 20% return and it seems safe, you are almost certainly wrong.  Either the return is not as high as you think or the risks are higher than you think.  If Compound was safer, more people would use it until the return was pushed down to a reasonable risk-adjusted return. The only reason the return is so high on using recursive leverage for yield farming is that it is actually risky.  For awhile the yield farmers were taking this high risk (and I admit many of them did not realize it) and they got what appeared to be a really high ROI, and then they got burned.  It makes no sense to reimburse them because these sorts of risks in a new protocol are the exact reason why more people aren’t using it yet (and once DeFi gets to the point of protecting against these risks better, more people will use it and they will push the returns down).



 rleshner:


Does compensating users create a social contract that doesn’t already exist? Does a social contract already exist? How would compensation change the future activity of users?



I think compensating the affected users sets a bad precedent because people need to understand the financial products they use and they need to take responsibility for evaluating the risks, and accept responsibility when the bad side of their risks manifests.  This was not a bug in the code, it was a combination of a bad design choice (Coinbase oracle vs Chainlink) and users who didn’t DYOR by understanding the existing oracle or pulling up the Coinbase DAI price history (or inspecting the liquidity of the Coinbase DAI markets, which could have revealed that the DAI liquidity on Coinbase was small enough that this attack could be profitable for the attacker).  If the affected users are compensated it will just encourage more risky behavior in the future and encourage people to use the protocol without understanding it.  What if Compound compensates the users, and switches to Chainlink, but somebody figures out an attack on the Chainlink oracle?  People would definitely expect compensation again but it starts to get impractical and create a slipper slope.  Sure it’s unlikely, but it is ultimately the responsibility of the users to consider and evaluate these risks.
I mentioned this above too, but I strongly believe Compound should remove any terminology around a “safe max” borrow from the UI.  “Safe Max” is a ridiculous and inherently flawed idea in this context because there are always multiple risks in the protocol code, the oracle code, counterparty risk from the managers of the stable coins, and many more.  Users need to be responsible for understanding and evaluating these risks on their own.  If you think that there is such a thing as a “safe max” borrow or a “safe” way to use Compound (Disclaimer: I am Compound user) I highly recommend that you do not use it.  There are relatively safe ways to use it, and I think many people have found ways to use it that are low risk and that most users understand these risks, but for the UI to bait people into thinking their position is “safe” because it displays as such is dangerous and will just lead to more tragedies in the future like this one.",59,116.8,2020-11-30
['DAI Liquidation - Compensation'],"Okay, let me get this straight. You correctly believe the protocol was attacked through oracle manipulation.



 TWS49:

Almost certainly manipulation by a liquidator who planned and scripted out the attack in advance.


You correctly point out that the UI misled users into believing using 80% of borrowing power was “safe.”



 TWS49:

I certainly think that the idea of a “safe max” to borrow is ridiculous and I do blame the Compound UI for using that term as being part of the problem.





 TWS49:

I mentioned this above too, but I strongly believe Compound should remove any terminology around a “safe max” borrow from the UI.


I’ll point out that the protocol has intentionally set aside funds as insurance:

Second, a portion of the interest paid by borrowers is set aside as  Reserves , which acts as insurance and is controlled by COMP token-holders.

And yet, you do not feel the facts and circumstances warrant a discussion of compensation for the victims. What exactly are those insurance funds for? Recapitalizing the protocol in the event of fund loss? Why not just write down everyone’s balance if users are not to be looked after and only protocol solvency is a priority.
I get the feeling that people are fine with screwing borrowers, because they “should have known better.” Well, without borrowers, there is no protocol and there is no reason for depositors too. I knew the market was volatile and paid down my debt to 80% per the protocol recommendation before going to sleep. Just hours later I was shocked to learn that I was liquidated improperly, and to add insult to injury my collateral was seized at an insulting and incredibly incorrect price thanks to the oracle attack.
Most if not all businesses as well as DeFi protocols have went out of their way to make it right for users who fell victim to protocol exploitation, which this clearly was. Yet you think Compound has no business doing so because users should have known better. If that’s the case, it will be hard to recommend Compound to anyone who doesn’t fancy themselves a smart contract researcher, and a hardcore one at that.
I have moved my funds and won’t be back unless there is at least an admission of fault on behalf of the the protocol, and partial if not full compensation.",57,86.4,2020-12-01
['Setup community cUNI Voting'],"Assuming the success of proposal 25 we will soon have a significant amount of UNI locked up un the cUNI contract. We have the ability as a community to delegate this UNI to any address.
This will be the best UNI governance experience for the average user:

Earn interest on UNI deposits
Borrow against your UNI
Vote for free
Help the community gather enough votes to propose

I propose delegating to the community multisig (0xbbf3f1421D886E9b2c5D716B5192aC998af2012c) and having off chain voting to decide how to vote as a community.
I have setup a snapshot space for cUNI at http://cuni.comp.vote. Shortly after every Uniswap proposal, we will setup voting where each address has votes according to their cUNI holdings at the time of the proposal. Before the Uniswap voting deadline, the community multisig will vote according to the cUNI holders’ decision.
Once cUNI accrues enough UNI to create proposals, we will allow for community member with at least x (maybe 100k?) UNI deposited in cUNI to start a vote on a new proposal. If the vote has 2/3 for yes, the community multisig will propose the requested proposal. For now, the multisig will not be proposing.",79,2650.8,2020-10-29

['Setup community cUNI Voting'],"I think this imposes some questions about the possible fee restructuring of Uniswap. With the V2 platform, the UNI governance might make the decision to redirect 0.05% to LPs. This means that the Compound contract might at some point start yielding fees from the sole ownership of UNI tokens. This would open new interesting ways to accrue funds for the Compound project. Nevertheless, it also opens some questions:
a) if I mint cUNI, would my ownership in proportion to non-used capital accrue the LP fees?
This is a relevant question since it might incentivize or disincentivize people to provide liquidity if they miss out on the 5.25% APY that would be produced by the following napkin math:Screen Shot 2020-10-14 at 2.57.27 PM1380×1286 291 KB
In other words, the yearly ROI on 400 UNI deposit would yield around 70 usd if kept within the account. Whether by depositing to Compound or not (and assuming the passive income on holding becomes true), you are essentially shorting UNI because you lose on the dividends in relation to what is the token utilization rate on Compound. If the whole APY from fees is lost, it would signal that only a very strongly opinionated shorters (and e.g., but not limited to, people who are very bullish on COMP) would be providing liquidity.
I currently don’t have much more to say, but hope this aspect would be taken into concern in further reiterations of the cUNI token.",55,176.0,2020-10-14
['Setup community cUNI Voting'],"This is a great point, and surprisingly, not the first time Compound has encountered a situation like this. A while back, MakerDAO introduced the DSR (DAI savings rate). Compound quickly updated cDAI to deposit market liquidity into DSR to make sure depositors don’t miss out on DSR.
If Uniswap starts disbursing fees to UNI holders, I’m sure that the community will update cUNI to distribute these fees to depositors if possible. A situation that could inhibit this would be requiring UNI to be locked in order to earn fees. I believe there is already a system setup for fee distribution, but I can’t look it up right now. Reading through that system would allow for a conclusive answer here.",52,55.4,2020-10-14
['Setup community cUNI Voting'],"Through further thought on the topic and speaking to others in the field, I’ve decided that weighting the votes simply by cUNI held at the time of the proposal is not ideal. This would allow for any large proposer to easily buy the cUNI vote by entering a leveraged position on for a few blocks.
The solution I am proposing is checking cUNI balance about a week prior to the vote and at the time of the vote. The user votes gets weighted with the min of the two. Another idea I have for weighting is setting it to 0 if the address is borrowing any UNI. This way we have slightly more control in avoiding purchasing the vote by large UNI holders. Any more input on the method for weighting votes would be greatly appreciated.",51,60.2,2020-10-21

['Setup community cUNI Voting'],"Hello @arr00
I want to express some concerns I have regarding Uniswap governance processes with the introduction of this proposal.
If I understand correctly, cUNI voting is a binary situation, which means that all the cUNI tokens vote one way.
If you lend on Compound and lose the vote, your UNI tokens do the opposite of your will. It is much worse than if they did nothing.
It magnifies the whale dominance in Uniswap governance.
This system allows big UNI holders to hijack the UNI locked on Compound and leverage their voting power.
My estimates are that a whale could gain 2.5x boost on his/her UNI voting power with virtually no cost.
Here’s how it’s calculated:
There are 15m UNI available to vote as cUNI. Bob adds 15m UNI to the fray and wins the vote, thus 2xing his voting power.
Additionally, Bob borrows DAI for 9m UNI (60% collateral) and lends it using another Lending protocol for 60% of UNI =  5.4m UNI. Bob repeats the process one more time and gets another 1.944m UNI.
This leaves us at 37.344m UNI gained from 15m UNI, i.e. ~2.5x boost.
==
I’ve pictured a scenario that is a little exaggerated, but it can easily be done on smaller, more subtle scale.
The important point here is that it can strongly feed into the whale power, or it can mildly feed into it.
But there’s no way it doesnt magnify the whale power, as the minority votes are turned against the minority with cUNI.",43,58.6,2020-10-31

Our strategy for calculating each score eliminates anyone borrowing UNI, which would mean they are attempting to get a leveraged voting position.

When voting as a block, there is no way to fully eliminate the issues presented by it, but I believe what I implemented does help. If we see any manipulation, the multisig may not vote. This is an experement, which may work out well: hopefully we will see.",35,42.0,2020-11-02

Previous discussion thread on migrating to the Open Price Feed.
Proposal Description
This proposal changes the price oracle in Compound to use the Open Price Feed deployed at 0x9b8eb8b3d6e2e0db36f41455185fef7049a35cae. The Open Price Feed is an open-source project where a set of reporters sign price data which is posted on-chain for use by DeFi protocols. There is no privilege required to post prices, and we encourage the community to build additional posters to keep prices up-to-date. The Compound Protocol will initially use price data from Coinbase (via the Coinbase Oracle) as well as a time-weighted average price from Uniswap’s on-chain markets to ensure price integrity.
The Open Price Feed has been audited by Open Zeppelin 1 2. The system initially supports prices for BAT, WBTC, COMP, DAI, ETH, KNC, LINK, REP, SAI, USDC, USDT and ZRX. The system is compatible with support for more tokens and different reporters, both of which would require a new Governance proposal.
The Open Price Feed system was announced almost a year ago. We envisioned the system as an easy way for different projects and exchanges to sign data without the burden of posting that data onto the Ethereum blockchain itself. Instead, the exchanges expose an HTTP endpoint with an Ethereum-signed message containing the price data. The goal is that every exchange can provide such data, which can be used by every DeFi project.
In the current incarnation of the Open Price Feed, it takes the prices from Coinbase’s Oracle (which was designed in coordination with the Open Price Feed) and it tests that price against a time-weighted average price (TWAP) from Uniswap v2. If the price for a given asset from Coinbase is within 20% of the Uniswap TWAP for that asset, it is posted and immediately is available for use in the Protocol (e.g. for collateral calculations). The TWAP calculation is based on the Uniswap Oracle concept.
The Open Price Feed has been running in production for several weeks and has been tested on the Ropsten and Kovan test-nets.

I’m going to tack on the screenshot of the Exodus desktop app’s explanation and instructions for using your cDAI, because it almost feels like this was intentionally worded in such a way, possibly to line the pockets of the COMP lending pool perhaps? All speculation of course, I’m just grasping at the void of where the straws should be, because there’s no way for me to get out of this chasm I’ve grown accustomed to.

The thing is exchanges are commonly known to designate specific ethereum address for specific token ONLY. And they specifically mention that any other token send to that address would be lost. Though technically, as this is still ethereum address it is able to recieve and hold any ERC20 token. And since exchange have key for that particular address only exchange can recover (send back) tokens from it. Would exchange do it or not or how much they want to charge for it is their choice, as per terms of service.
As for your complain about wallet, there is no way for wallet to know if destination ethereum address is somewhat “special”, and only want to recieve a particular token.

['Compound Contributor Grants'],"@jmo @tarun @peteris, and Rei Chiang
Our first proposal, Reduce COMP emissions by 20%, focused on providing a healthy amount of COMP for governance to utilize. Previously, the protocol was spending 0.5 COMP / block on liquidity incentives to borrowers and lenders. However, after our proposal (and proposal 10), the protocol’s Comptroller contract now holds a treasury that grows by 0.148 COMP / block and spends 0.352 COMP / block on liquidity incentives. But how exactly can governance spend this treasury? The answer to this question is a bit more complicated.
Currently, the Comptroller doesn’t have a particularly clean way for governance to grant COMP to a specific address. This means that the barrier to making payments is higher than it needs to be, especially for less technical proposal authors. Moreover, it would be convenient for Governance to be able to stream payments to participants, akin to a subscription. For instance, Governance may vote to pay for development of new features via quarterly payments.
Robert’s post a few months back describes a plethora of new ways the community can contribute to Compound. The post details how COMP grants will enable a number of improvements for both smart contract changes and risk management. Recent events, such as the Dai liquidations, have increased the urgency for a COMP grant feature, as the community has proposed a number of items that require such grants. These items that have come up since Robert’s post include:

Reimbursing those liquidated during the Thanksgiving liquidation event, as proposed by MrHen
Paying for the development of new features and risk monitoring tools (c.f. Robert’s post on Dai Market Risk)
Retrospective airdrop to early COMP users (akin to the Uniswap airdrop), proposed by Ali Yahya

As part of our work on adding vesting to the protocol, we added these features in a pull request. Given the recent increase in urgency for a simple mechanism for governance to make payments, we will split this pull request into three:

Proposal to add one-time and streaming grants (PR)
Proposal to add vesting within the protocol (PR)
Proposal to set the vesting parameter based on community feedback

We wrote a high-level specification that goes through the technical components added. Furthermore, we commissioned an audit of both the grant and vesting related changes by Quantstamp. There are no major issues with the changes, in spite of the relatively large surface area touched by the vesting changes. Given that the vesting changes affect economic behaviors within the protocol, especially for those building on top of the protocol, we are taking a more cautious approach and testing these changes on testnet over the coming weeks. We request that community members who integrate Compound within their products, such as wallets and exchanges, try out vesting and provide feedback, should this change cause any disruption to your product.
We are going to test out this feature by paying Gauntlet for the development costs associated with this change. This grant will cover:

Development costs for CP030
Audit costs
Development costs for the future vesting proposal (which we have already implemented and is linked above)

We hope this will be the first of many COMP grants to community contributors.

Overview:
Lines 1317-1320 of Comptroller.sol do not achieve their intended purpose, due to a missing else-statement that should surround the code on line 1321 of Comptroller.sol.
Intended Effect:
The comment states that if compSpeed is 0, the lastContributorBlock storage slot should be released so that gas can be saved.
Actual Effect:
Since line 1321 of Comptroller.sol sets lastContributorBlock to getBlockNumber() regardless of whether compSpeed is 0 or not, no gas savings are achieved. Deleting a storage slot and then immediately filling it again does not yield a net gas refund. As such, lines 1317-1320 currently do nothing useful even if compSpeed is 0; in fact, they slightly increase the gas cost of the function in all cases, due to the ‘compSpeed == 0’ comparison.
Solution:
Change this:
    if (compSpeed == 0) {
        // release storage
        delete lastContributorBlock[contributor];
    }
    lastContributorBlock[contributor] = getBlockNumber();

To this:
    if (compSpeed == 0) {
        // release storage
        delete lastContributorBlock[contributor];
    } else {
        lastContributorBlock[contributor] = getBlockNumber();

['Compound Contributor Grants'],"@jvaqa, great catch!
Indeed, if we were to set up and then release a contributor reward, this would leave an extra storage slot in play and waste gas.
For the benefit of governance, important to add that the recommended fix is preferrable but non-urgent:

Consequence is low (one off storage slot paid for executing a _setContributorCompSpeed proposal)
It would require at least 2 additional patches to come to a situation where a contributor would both be receiving and then stop receiving a streaming grant. In practice we probably won’t see this in a while.
Even if that happened, the above fix could still be used to retroactively reset the storage slot by calling _setContributorCompSpeed again for that contributor and releasing the storage slot.

Governance can decide to just leave this in for the moment to be fixed in the upcoming vesting patch (or the first accepted Comptroller change thereafter).
For reference, this is the line in question: https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/3244eed6beefd589f6e9ef640b822c6c615e2433/contracts/Comptroller.sol#L1320.",59,66.8,2020-12-07

grantComp (PR #79)
Vesting (PR #71)
Distribution improvements

We plan to see the remaining proposals through and do not plan to request any additional grant.
Also @arr00 - as far as communication processes go, I think this 1 week policy is a great rule of thumb for future proposals. The changes have been discussed on the recent developer calls and the code has been available for review on Github for a few weeks now, but posting on the forums more frequently in the future is an obvious improvement to community involvement. We had a strong bias towards pushing this one out because we wanted to enable the community to decide how to compensate users affected by the recent DAI liquidation incident.
Hopefully, the existence of the grant function will help spearhead the discussion about how grants should function and the procedure around them. From our perspective, we wanted to set the following precedents:

People who take on larger development projects, like those requiring audits, can be compensated for those changes
Not all work needs to be done speculatively. Currently, anyone contributing needs to make changes on the off-chance those are later accepted by the protocol. In this case, we’ve completed all of this work ahead of time. However, hopefully by requesting payment before all of the changes are deployed, we can take a small step in direction that is more appealing to contributors.

Wesley van Heije - Protocol development pipeline with Tokenlog (Starts at 7:45)

Wesley discussed his project Tokenlog, which allows tokenholders to actively signal which development topics are important to them, rather than just voting on individual proposals in the governance voting process. Tokenlog connects to Github and your Ethereum wallet, so you can use your COMP to directly vote on issues and pull requests. Wesley is looking for community feedback on Tokenlog, so check out the beta version of the project and the slide deck and let him know your thoughts.

Dennison Bertram - Tally’s DeFi governance portal (starts at 16:58)

Dennison shared a preview of Tally’s DeFi governance portal, which allows users to participate in Compound governance and view insightful data on past proposals and top advocates. The team’s overall goal is to add transparency to the governance process, and is exploring ways to verify community participants by their Ethereum address. Feel free to reach out to Dennison with any feedback on the governance portal or ideas for identity verification.

Zefram Lou - 88pmh’s EMA Oracle (Starts at 26:20)

Zefram Lou explained the inner workings of the EMA oracle that 88mph leverages for its fixed and floating rate interest calculations. The oracle uses the cToken exchange rate, rather than the supply rate per block, to estimate the interest rate since the exchange rate is less volatile than the supply rate and presents less of a risk of being manipulated. You can view the addresses of the EMA oracle in the 88mph documentation and use them in your project.

Open Discussion (Starts at 36:36)

During the open discussion section, Dennison Bertram asked how Compound governance verifies identity, Praneeth brought up the topic of cCOMP voting, Guillame Palayer provided additional information on 88mph’s EMA oracle, and Arr00 shared a screenshot of the new comp.vote page.

['Reserve Factor Standardization'],"Background
The Reserve Factors of supported markets are inconsistent, and have evolved through a variety of governance proposals and new market launches.
Reserves are taken out of interest paid by borrowers, and reduce the corresponding supply interest rate in the market. Reserves accumulate in each cToken contract, and can be deployed by the Governance process for any variety of use-cases.
Current Reserve Factors
USDC: 5%
USDT: 20%
DAI: 5%
ETH: 10%
WBTC: 10%
BAT: 50%
ZRX: 50%
UNI: 20%
COMP: 20%
Philosophy
Reserve Factors have been a long-standing discussion in Discord, and there are a variety of lenses through which to view them. Historically, discussion has centered around:

Reserve factors are the protocol’s fee to offset risk (which is incurred when there is borrowing outstanding)
Reserve factors incentivize behavior, by acting a component of interest rate models
When reserves are large relative to borrowing demand, reserves functionally add liquidity to a market

Changing Reserve Factors does not immediately change the risk of the protocol (compared to changing a Collateral Factor), which should make them flexible levers to consider adjusting.
Potential Approach for Discussion
Reserve Factors should be standardized in a consistent format–just as interest rate models have begun becoming standardized across markets. By using the risk associated with borrowing the asset as a parameter (e.g. volatility of the asset), we have a starting point to frame new reserve factors.
I would suggest (and love everyone’s feedback on), the following Reserve Factors:
USDC: 5% -> 7.5%
USDT: 20% -> 7.5%
DAI: 5% -> 10%
ETH: 10% -> 20%
WBTC: 10% -> 20%
BAT: 50% -> 25%
ZRX: 50% -> 25%
UNI: 20% -> 25%
COMP: 20% -> 25%
These create sequentially higher Reserves from borrowing stablecoins, to semi-volatile stablecoins, to large liquid collateral, to more volatile collateral assets. Going forward, as new assets are added to the protocol, they could follow this format as well.",68,2188.6,2020-11-23
['Reserve Factor Standardization'],"Numbers above look pretty good to me!
One potential modification, I think it would be interesting to add a surcharge onto the reserve factor when total reserve quantity for a market is below x% of total assets borrowed. If this is feasible on a technical level, it may be an effective way to discourage excessive leverage and help bootstrap reserves for new markets.",58,101.6,2020-11-23
['Reserve Factor Standardization'],"That’s a cool idea.
The cToken contracts accept Reserve Factor as a Governance function; DAI, USDT, UNI, and COMP (the “gen-2” upgradable cTokens) could evolve to use more complex logic, but the other markets (ETH, USDC, WBTC, BAT, ZRX) need to be set manually. For simplicity, all of these could apply a “layer” in the manual Governance process.
The other perspective could be that Reserves are somewhat fungible; there’s nothing to stop Governance from using the Reserves from an old market, to support a new market somehow (this was actually done a long time ago, to transfer the SAI reserves from v1 to DAI in v2).",58,21.6,2020-11-23
['Reserve Factor Standardization'],"I also suggest having 2-step approach to Seting Reserve factor. I believe we should determine target reserve pool for every market. For example, it could be something like 5% of supplied assets. So, when reserves for market are lower than target (5%) reserve factor is set into accumulation mode and set to higher rate, to stimulate reserves grow.
When reserves for market are at target level or above it, reserve factor is set to normal mode, which is lower.
USDC: 5% -> 10%
DAI: 5% -> 10%
Reserves for both this stable coins are very low in comparison with size of market, i personally would like to see even higher reserve factor than 10% in accumulation phase.
USDT: 20% -> 20%
I suggest to stay alert towards that particular stable coin. Despite of it being widely used, there is no evidence whatsoever that it’s backed 1to1 by USD, as there are no audits provided by issuer. It might be, it might be not, but risk is definitely elevated with that coin, and reserves for market are miserable (126 000)
ETH: 10% -> 20%
WBTC: 10% -> 20%
I’m not against accumulating reserves for that markets, as they are very small, but it’s worth mentioning that even such increase might be futile. There’s very low demand on borrowing side, and interest is very low also. Actually it’s so low accumulation, that might be it even worth consideration to subsidize these markets from reserves accrued from other markets (aka primary stablecoins)
BAT: 50% -> 25%
This one is special, as being the one heavily used in initial farming of COMP, which in combination with initial high reserve factor let this market to accrue considerable reserves. This pool i beleive doesn’t really need to grow reserves and can benefit from lower reserve factor indeed.
UNI: 20% -> 25%
COMP: 20% -> 25%
We might consider having higher reserve factor for these tokens, as these markets are new and reserves are still low.",51,55.2,2020-11-24
['Reserve Factor Standardization'],"To address USDT specifically; I (and the majority of the community) completely agree that there is considerable risk of USDT  declining in value. It’s not fully backed, it’s not transparent, it’s printed whimsically, etc etc.
This risk is reflect in USDT’s 0% Collateral Factor, e.g. if it collapses in value, the protocol doesn’t suffer. But, it doesn’t have any more upside volatility than USDC – borrowing USDT doesn’t jeopardize USDT suppliers more than borrowing USDC jeopardizes USDC suppliers. IMO, they warrant the same Reserve Factor.
On the other hand, DAI is a somewhat more volatile stablecoin–we saw considerable up-side price volatility in March 2020, which poses slightly more risk that DAI borrows aren’t properly liquidated–leading to losses for DAI suppliers.
This is why, IMO, the framework for Reserve Factors should look at volatility as a starting point.
Second, your perspective for “seed the reserves” is a fair argument for having slightly larger Reserve Factors across the board. ",46,44.2,2020-11-24
['Reserve Factor Standardization'],"Okay! My thoughts:


Regardless of what our philosophy on reserves are, I believe we all would agree having larger reserves in 5 years is better than having smaller ones.


Tokens with the lowest reserve rates pay the greatest amount of interest into the reserves. Tokens with high reserve rates pay the smallest amount into reserves. Yes, I know correlation does not equal causation but this is a factual observation


We are very early as protocol, in absolute numbers these reserve rates will not significantly de-risk the protocol. (i.e moving wBTC from 10% - 20% will change reserve growth from $20 a day to $40 day).


A primary value proposition of decentralized finance is dis-intermediating rent seeking third parties. The protocol taking 25% of all interest paid to lenders is goes against this ethos.


The primary value proposition of the protocol is earning yield, optimizing for maximum yield rates will lead to faster growth.


Given this, I would propose the following rates:
USDC: 5%
USDT: 5%
DAI: 5%
ETH: 10%
WBTC: 10%
BAT: 10%
ZRX: 10%
UNI: 10%
COMP: 10%
Stablecoins 5%, non-stable coins 10%.
Questions


My main assumption here is that higher reserve rates right now will not meaningfully de-risk the protocol when we look at the actual numbers. We should look at this question more closely


The counter argument I see to this is that right now borrowing and lending is being incentived with COMP and so therefore it’s a good time for the protocol to be more extractive. This argument makes sense to me but as total borrowing and supplying grows the relative subsidy of the COMP will shrink

 lay2000lbs:

We are very early as protocol, in absolute numbers these reserve rates will not significantly de-risk the protocol. (i.e moving wBTC from 10% - 20% will change reserve growth from $20 a day to $40 day).


Your observation is correct, but i do completely disagree with your colnclusions. Actually there’s much more sense to do exactly opposite.
Let’s take a look at WBTC market:
Current Reserve factor: 10%
Current Reserves: 1.2383 WBTC
Interest Paid/ day: $192.15 (10% of that will go to grow reserves)
Current WBTC Supply: $489 Million ( 90% of interst Paid/ day are up for distribution between suppliers, which is $172.8 )
It’s pretty much safe to assume that interest accrued on Supplied WBTC is pretty much negligeble and close to zero. It doesn’t really impact Suppliers if they get their 0.01$ per month or not at all.
Now let’s take closer look at Eth market in similar way:
Current Reserve factor: 10%
Current Reserves: 100.02 Eth
Interest Paid/ day: $1315.15 (10% of that will go to grow reserves)
Current Eth Supply: $747 Million ( 90% of interst Paid/ day are up for distribution between suppliers, which is $1183.5 per day )
In similar way, we can observe that interest gained by Suppliers is negligeble.
Conclusion: Interest is not a primary if not at all motive in Supplying Eth or WBTC to Compound, but rather serving as a Collateral.
Proposal: Set Reserve factor for ETH and WBTC markets at 100% for next 3 month and evaluate after that. Revisit Reserve factor for these markets in 3 month and decide on if it should continue as is, or be adjusted to lower Reserve Factor.
Argument: For every single WBTC or ETH supplier interest accrued is a dust amount, however for Reserves while small, but still overtime noticeble amount, which would support seeding of Reserves for that markets. I don’t see a noticeble downside for suppliers as they were not actually gaining any substaitional amount to begin with. By forfeiting their pennies suppliers will help to create some reserves for protocol, which ensures more stability and thus financial security for Suppliers in future.",42,43.4,2020-11-25
['Reserve Factor Standardization'],"One thought I was considering (along with an earlier proposal) is to essentially enable COMP holders to use their COMP in creating/adding to reserve pools - potentially across the board in terms of serving all markets.
Generally in agreement with @rleshner’s proposal to have a uniform notion of reserve factors - and also driving a better understanding of the risk framework associated with borrow demand. However - an increase in market driven rates, as pointed out by @lay2000lbs, wouldn’t really shift the needle in terms of enabling building up larger reserves in the short/mid-term + it has the effect of dampening supply rates and thus the enthusiasm of backers to participate in a market that reduces their capability to earn interest for taking the risk of participation.
To make this fair to people who are just using the platform to borrow/lend assets and may not be fully incentivised to be long-term participants/contributers to the growth of Compound, we should consider one of two alternatives:
i) Increase the COMP distribution (in conjunction with vesting) in order to offset some of the losses they’d be facing + also potentially incentivise them to be more engaged in Compound
ii) I don’t understand the technical feasibility of this, but I’d really like to see the emergence of a common COMP reserve pool, with the capability for COMP holders to add liquidity to the same. The idea would be very similar to the notion of CET in the Basel III spec, with the notion that this reserve could serve as the minimum requirements needed to serve the risk parameters of a given market, in addition to serving as a function to signal the appetite to seed current/new markets.
Additionally, this would mean that COMP holders who are incentivised towards the growth of the protocol would have a very meaningful way of doing the same by chipping in liquidity to this reserve pool - with the understanding that this pool would be subject to liquidation risks as well as a potential to earn some part of the interest in the form of further COMP incentives/a few basis points off the supply rates. The additional reserve factor (as it is structured today) could then take the additional form of a market-driven assessment of risk in the underlying asset - and be used to contribute rewards to the COMP reserve pool holders.
If this were truly possible to implement, this would be a much neater way of classifying risk ratios in terms of risk-weighted assets, outflows and net exposure. Basel III specifies seeding markets with 4.5% of RWA’s - if the community is interested, could pull up some numbers on loans on the book for the past month/3 and use that as a basis to set out to find a number that makes sense, as opposed to a finger-in-the-air estimation of 1% to start out with.

['Reserve Factor Standardization'],"Hey, monet appreciate your work in trying to get Uniswap governance moving anywhere. 
But i think you have a wrong way of thinking about COMP. Protocol isn’t distributing 290000$. COMP isn’t money, it have zero backing and cost zero to protocol to create and distribute. Same as with UNI. Basically that $290000 per day isn’t distributed by protocol, it’s actually taken from market, protocol have zero cost of making that.
It is a combination of distribution of tokens AND buying demand, which makes it’s value. But for protocol itself it’s not money. It could potentially be money if that COMP would be converted to Eth, or btc, or stable coin. But that is IF. Maybe market would be able to absorb it, if it was to be sold, but highly unlikely without price impact. It’s wrong to percieve COMP reserves as big money bag sitting there. Because today it might look as 125$ per comp and in 1 month it may very well be 10$ per COMP. It’s extremelly dangerous to treat something with highly variable value as a reserves.
Reserves on the other hand, especially in stable coins and maybe in eth or btc to certain extend are money already.
However, that brings us to another interesting option for protocol. For example, portion of COMP could potentially be auctioned (solld) to create some reserves buffer for Compound pools rather than distributed to liquidity providers. And that might be another viable option for making reserves aside of Reserve Factor.",39,17.8,2020-11-26

COMP has value and we should consider it a liquid asset. Maybe we can work in fixing the inflation of the token, so whales stop dumping it as soon as they collect it.
Increasing the reserve is a good way to do this.",37,7.4,2020-11-27

Proposal to Increase DAI Reserve Factor from 5% to 15%
Objectives
I am working on a series of proposals to 1) reduce the risk in the cDAI market, and 2) compensate users who were impacted in the DAI liquidation event. I am working with active community members, stakeholders, and users of the protocol to enact these changes.
Reserve Factor Overview
The Reserve Factor in Compound is the parameter that represents the percentage of the interest paid by borrowers that accrue to that cToken’s Reserve Pool. The Reserve Pool protects lenders against borrower default.
Raising the Reserve Factor for DAI from 5% to 15%
Following the DAI liquidation event, many community members have voiced concerns regarding the state of the DAI market on Compound: the cDAI market accounts for 47% of all of the assets on Compound and exceeds the total DAI in circulation by 590M, denoting the over-concentrated and over-levered risk in DAI market. Various changes have been proposed including a revamp of the oracle system. In the interim, given the additional time and discussion needed for a new oracle system and/or liquidation mechanics, adjusting existing parameters such as the reserve factor can immediately start to de-risk the DAI market.
I propose raising the DAI reserve factor from 5% to 15% for the following reasons:


De-risk the DAI market: A higher reserve factor would decrease the economics of recursively borrowing DAI and in turn reduce the concentration, leverage, and risk of the DAI market.


Increase DAI reserves: This would help build additional reserves as a safety measure for Compound and its user-base.


Standardize Reserve Factors: The reserve factors across stablecoin markets are inconsistent. For example, USDC which has a fixed price of $1.0, has the same 5% reserve factor as DAI, a stablecoin with relatively higher price volatility. A higher reserve factor would adequately move borrow/lend activity from higher-risk assets to lower risk assets to improve the overall protocol risk profile. I’ve consulted with various active participants and believe that a 15% reserve factor is adequate, since a 10% reserve factor may not be enough to de-risk the market, and 20% may be overly aggressive.


Relatively quick change to improve security: Adjusting the DAI reserve factor requires no changes to the contracts. Ideally, a reserve factor change would be the first of many changes to improve the security of Compound.


The community has already signaled a strong interest in raising the reserve factor through a forum poll.

['Increase DAI Reserve Factor from 5% to 15%'],"@blck, thank you for incorporating the changes outlined in this proposal into your prop31 proposal.",37,602.4,2020-12-08
['DAI Market Risk'],"This is a dedicated thread for the community to discuss potential changes to the Compound DAI market. See the main thread  for information and analysis of the liquidation event.
Background
The DAI market on Compound has been growing for months as a result of the COMP Distribution; it currently accounts for 309,178 of 427,880 COMP distributed to users.
With 1.56 billion DAI supplied to the protocol, and 1.20 billion DAI borrowed, the Compound Dai market eclipses both the underlying DAI market, the liquidity on exchanges, and the global trading volume of DAI by a vast margin.
The Gauntlet Market Risk Assessment  analyzes markets as a function of total outstanding debt relative to daily trading volume–Compound’s DAI market is literally off the charts of any scope considered in the report, which likely contributed to the DAI liquidation event.
The community may want to consider changes to limit the market risk of DAI. Here is a summary of the ideas and levers that have been discussed in Discord so far:
1. Disable DAI’s COMP Distribution
By disabling the distribution of COMP to the DAI market, the incentive to use DAI over another stablecoin like USDC would be reduced, and market size may shift between markets quickly. The COMP Distribution could be re-activated once the market risk has been reduced, or other changes are implemented.
2. Increase DAI Reserve Factor
Increasing the Reserve Factor of DAI would decrease the attractiveness of DAI relative to other stablecoins, but in a significantly less material fashion than disabling the COMP Distribution. Usage of DAI may shift much more slowly.
Reserves would also build more quickly, benefitting the protocol & user-base.
3. Set a DAI Borrowing Cap
Setting a Borrowing Cap would limit the market size of DAI; this would prevent new usage, while preserving the economics of existing users.
A Borrowing Cap could be set relative to the amount of DAI outstanding (1/3 would be 300 million), or as a function of daily trading volume (300%, the high end of the risk assessment, would be 300 million).
This can be implemented with the Community Multi-Sig, which sets Borrowing Caps, without requiring a governance proposal (fast solution).
4. Lower DAI Collateral Factor
Lowering the Collateral Factor would decrease the leverage of users supplying DAI, and the attractiveness to “yield farm” with the asset, but would likely not change borrowing demand for DAI. Alternatively, the Collateral Factor of another stablecoin (e.g. USDC) could be increased, lowering DAI’s Collateral Factor on a relative basis.
5. Supply Cap
The cDAI contract could be upgraded to implement a Supply Cap, which is an alternate approach to limit market size. This would require development resources (slow solution).
Other Ideas
All other ideas are encouraged – and the community may decide / believe that the market doesn’t need to be modified. To expedite the conversation, a quick poll:

['DAI Market Risk'],"While it’s true that DAI market size is a direct result of COMP distribution and early imbalances, which led to it being Dai and not something else. While DAI market looks huge, it’s just accounting, and there is not even 500M of actual DAI inside the protocol, as Supplied Dai and Borrowed Dai are in majority very same Dai often supplied and borrowed at same time by same accounts. Risks are generally concentrated in that accounts and for that accounts, rather than for protocol in general.
I also believe that current COMP distribution model isn’t really that great, and certanly should be adjusted, but i think disabling it completely for Dai market is somewhat unfair and too radical. Though i do think it’s also bad design to be able to capture majority of distribution in one particular market, bleeding other ones off initiative. What i would prefer to see is more complex model, where every single market couldn’t get less than certain percent of daily distribution. Like not less than 5% of daily COMP distribution, which will stimulate usage of other markets and somewhat balance out distribution.
As for Reserve Factor, that is certanly too low for DAI market size, and i believe it should be at least 10%, if not 20% until Reserves for Dai market reach at least 1% of Supplied. Currently they are not even at 0.1%
I don’t like ideas of borrowing or supply  caps, as it’s somewhat temporary patch rather than solution. If it works, it should work on any scale, if not, than it should be fixed, caps don’t fix anything but just create a false feeling of safety. And it’s also a competetive disadvantage, as if users can’t execute their strategy because of caps, they might go to other platform without such restrictions, and possibly even stay there.
If we look at Collateral factor on relative basis, like what is suggested with USDC, it’s probably possible as well, but i don’t see much margin there unfortunately. USDC collateral factor could be increaset to like 80%, but the higher we go, the more risk could potentially be generated for market, which in combination with generally low reserves everywhere aside of BAT market could be a recipe fo disaster in future. Reserves should be created before and far ahead of any potential accident and i strongly believe Reserve Factor should be increased overall, not only for Dai market. Actually it should be done “yesterday”.
For our current dai market situation i would suggest:
increase Reserve Factor for Dai to 20%
increase Collateral Factor for usdc to 80%
possibly decrease Collateral factor for Dai to 70%
Observe the results. In meantime think about improvement to the Comp distribution model.",73,34.6,2020-11-29
['DAI Market Risk'],"Overall, I don’t think we should make adjustments to the Dai market unless it is a temporary change before an oracle update can be put in place.
My opinion is that the primary issue here is not risk parameters of the Dai market but a rather brittle oracle design. The oracle did perform as intended which is great but unfortunately we now understand it’s possible for the oracle to perform as intended and for it also not to accurately reflect the fair market price of Dai (I’m basing this assertion on my understanding that Coinbase Dai price was a major outlier).",59,66.8,2020-11-29

These are the current outstanding total debts per assets, normalized with today’s Messari’s 24 hour real volume.
As Robert notes, the Gauntlet risk assessment simulations find the “safe” limits somewhere around 300%, so DAI has clearly blown way passed the point of concern. It may be true that the collateral used for most of the DAI debt is DAI itself, instead of a more volatile asset like ETH, which would reduce the risk of the system becoming undercollateralized, as simulated by Gauntlet, but as we’ve seen with this liquidation incident, debt exceeding liquidity by such vast amounts carries other risks.",62,122.4,2020-11-29
['DAI Market Risk'],"After analyzing the situation more in depth and reading some of Rob’s comments. It does seem most sensible to disable COMP distribution for Dai.
The core issue here is that the Dai market on Compound is so large in relationship to total Dai market cap that the market for it on Coinbase can be manipulated and therefore Coinbase is not acting reliably as a price oracle.
The reason the Dai market is so large is because the COMP disbursal skews borrowing / lending incentives. So I would be in favor of removing the COMP disbursal temporarily and putting it back in place when the oracle issue has been more deeply analyzed and addressed.",59,71.8,2020-11-30
['DAI Market Risk'],"Raising DAI reserve factor seems like a win-win: reduces incentives to borrow and resupply DAI for COMP farming, while building up reserves to use in future drawdowns.
Disabling COMP rewards for DAI is a pretty drastic step, it will likely result in leveraged farming moving to other assets. Would Compound be better off with a massive amount of recursive USDC or ETH leverage for farming? These assets arguably have much worse supply elasticity (at least in the short term - minutes or hours), and could be more vulnerable to liquidity crises.
It would be slightly problematic if an issue that was (apparently?) caused by Coinbase deposit/withdrawal problems resulted in Compound increasing reliance on Coinbase’s USDC mint.",56,106.2,2020-12-01

Either of those seems preferable as they both have much more liquidity in markets than DAI. Though the current amount of DAI debt would probably be too much even for USDC markets. A drastic step is urgently required since DAI borrowers are at the moment at risk of the exact same market manipulation attack being repeated.",49,49.8,2020-12-01
['DAI Market Risk'],"I think it’s not expedient to discuss specific changes to the DAI market, as the problem is not a specific DAI market problem.
The root cause is, that the open oracle, which Compound uses, has got only one source, which is Coinbase.

['DAI Market Risk'],"No, that is a misunderstanding, exacerbated by some obvious shills. This was not an oracle issue, it was a market liquidity issue.

['DAI Market Risk'],"Again, it doesn’t really matter if this was an attack or a liquidity crunch, the point is that changing the oracle by adding more markets does not address the vulnerability of DAI debt in the system exceeding all global DAI market liquidity by a fantastic amount, as you can see in the attached table.

DAI Liquidation Event


    Coinbase looked at the data from many different angles and concluded that not only were there no price manipulation alerts in our trade surveillance software, but we did not find any evidence of collusion or single actors that pushed the price higher. We believe our books properly operated according to the availably liquidity at the time which, in stablecoin markets, may become thin as price moves away due to the collateralized nature of these markets.

@wario  What information do you have that shows it was an attack contrary to what oracle’s CTO says? Is this just conjecture?",38,7.6,2020-12-04
['DAI Market Risk'],"Expanding a bit on why addressing the DAI market risk is of urgent necessity.
There are, at least, two important risks when we have an asset in the system in vast excess of what liquidity is available in the markets.
1) Risk of the system becoming under-collateralized:  This is the issue addressed by the Gauntlet Risk analysis linked by @rleshner in the OP. The gist of this risk is that if we have collateral for an asset in excess of market liquidity available, in a situation of a sharp price drop for the asset, liquidators would not be able to sell the seizable assets quickly, and will likely not want to risk holding an asset that is falling in price either, so they would not perform liquidations and the system becomes under-collateralized
2) Risk of market manipulation:  When outstanding debt of an asset exceeds market liquidity by a sufficient amount, it becomes profitable to artificially move the price of said asset with the intention of unfairly liquidating borrowers for a huge profit. This might or might not have been what happened with this event, but regardless, the cost of buying DAI up to $1.3 was in the order of 21k USD, and required under 400k USDC to perform. To put these numbers in context, the largest single liquidation during the event netted the liquidator in the order of 3M DAI.
DAI in the system is over 4000% global daily volume, according to Messaris’ data, so as mentioned several times, neither of these risks can be resolved by doing any kind of oracle change, though IMO discussions of oracle revamping are also worth having after we deal with this more pressing issue. The only realistic way to resolve these risks is by  reducing the amount of DAI in the system by a great amount. I don’t really know which of the options laid out in the OP are the best ones to take, but I think it should be clear that the goal should be to select the ones that result in a swifter reduction of Compound’s  present DAI market risk.
Some have commented, here and on the Discord, that these risks are mitigated because a lot of the largest DAI borrwers/depositors are “loopers”, that is to say, they recursively borrow and deposit DAI as a COMP farming strategy. This is definitely true, and for the ones that are “perfectly looped”, meaning they only borrow and supply one asset, these risks are nullified as their collateral and debts grow and shrink concurrently, not having an effect on their account’s health. However, it is definitely incorrect to assume that all the DAI in the system is “perfectly looped” as has been shown by the current event liquidations.",38,42.6,2020-12-05
['DAI Market Risk'],"Why other protocols did not have a “DAI event”?
Obviously, this is a flaw in the price discovery mechanism (oracle) in the Compound protocol.
And please maybe I missed something in Gauntlet researsch paper, but in simulation they write: “assuming that the price of DAI is stable” and use constant gas fee.
Is possible that liquidation event on compound had frontrunning factor? Because gas fee was 500gwei in moment.
My opinion is that COMP farming should be reduced only for stablecoin pairs.
Is there an advantage for the protocol in farming with stablecoin pairs (besides pumping volume)?
Only DAI market risk is biggest volume opposit to other assets because it is more suitable for manipulation.",35,57.0,2020-12-05
['DAI Market Risk'],"Just want to highlight that DAI liquidity is qualitatively different than other assets. There is no possibility of a sell side liquidity crisis in the defi/dex context, Compound liquidators can always source DAI from MakerDAO at a $1 mark price.

I was in the same situation a couple of months ago during the defi craze.
What really happens is a constant problem with the ethereum network. When the network is heavy loaded with many transactions, the miners increase the amount of gwei (a small denomination of ETH) in order to give priority to important transactions.
What I suggest is connecting to compound with MetaMask or any non-custodian wallet that allows you to set the amount of gwei you’re willing to pay.
Another thing that you can do is to withdraw your funds when transactions fees are low, you can use this website to check the current prices:

ETH gas price recommendations.





The current 15 gwei is around 22 cents per transaction (~21K gas) just remember that compound requires a few amount of transactions (gas) to interact with the smart contract and your wallet.
Another cheaper option if you’re a bit tech savvy is interact directly with the contract in etherscan and withdraw the funds from there.
PS: Hopefully when ETH2 is released, your grandkids will ask you about the time you spent six dollars to withdraw three dollars from compound.

Background
Vesting COMP has been brought up recently in two forum discussions:

Compound Proposal 022: Systematically Reduce Emissions Quantity
Faster way to real community governance

Gauntlet has been working on designing a vesting mechanism whose parameters can be controlled by the community via governance. We started by looking at the designs used in other protocols: A number of other protocols have accrued rewards vesting, with Synthetix being the most well-known vesting mechanism. The design of cTokens provides both flexibility with regard to how vesting quantities should be calculated and presents trade-offs with regards to gas and code complexity. Given that the community will likely want to incentivize COMP for participation, liquidity, and to compensate for improvements to the protocol’s security and/or feature set, we believe in adding a vesting mechanic that can handle all of these use cases.
The liquidity provisioning use-case, pioneered by Synthetix and copied by virtually all of the new yield farming protocols, is most sensitive to the form of vesting used. In particular, if COMP holders want to supply their cTokens to a Uniswap, the accrued vested COMP impacts the value of a Uniswap liquidity provider (LP) share. Let’s walk through this before going through the different models of vesting.
Liquidity Incentives don’t commute with vesting
Should the COMP community decide to prioritize on-chain, non-custodial forms of liquidity, it will be necessary to use COMP to incentivize on-chain trading in the future. For provenance, recent (08/25/2020, 8pm UTC) Nansen data shows the following distribution of COMP at exchanges, which indicates that very little is kept on-chain:
image1786×912 116 KB
Compare this to the exchange distribution for Synthetix (08/25/2020, 8pm UTC):
image1774×894 119 KB
Let’s explicitly see why this complicates the math for traders and liquidity providers. In this example, we are assume that a COMP or cToken liquidity provider stakes their LP shares into a Synthetix-like rewards contract to earn the liquidity incentive. Suppose that one places 1 cUSDT and 1 cUSDC in the Uniswap cUSDT/cUSDC pool. Furthermore, suppose that in one day, the cUSDT earns 0.1% of interest and 1 COMP while the cUSDC earns 0.2% of interest and 2 COMP. Now consider two different vesting styles:

COMP is vested continuously: Uniswap LP share should be valued at the price of the underlying coins (USDT, USDC) plus the accrued trading fees and interest plus the value of COMP less the 95% percentile gas costs for a withdrawal transaction
COMP is vested discretely: Uniswap LP share should be values at the price of the underlying plus the accrued trading fees and interest plus the discounted value of the COMP less gas fees

Why do we have to discount (e.g. a la discounted cash flow) the COMP portion of the share? Since COMP is more volatile than the assets producing it (cUSDT, cUSDC), the holder of the LP share needs to discount the value of the share based on how long it takes to claim COMP. For instance, if COMP followed the weekly emission model of Synthetix and the time until the next reward claimed is T, then we would discount the COMP component of the LP share by a factor such as exp(-sqrt(volatility(COMP, USDT) * volatility(COMP, USDC))* T) [0]. In a sense, discrete vesting reduces the expected reward for LPs, even though it costs the network the same amount in terms of emissions.
Why do COMP voters have to care about this? Suppose that the community first chooses to do discrete vesting (e.g. a weekly distribution akin to Synthetix). If the community later decides to incentivize on-chain liquidity (as opposed to centralized liquidity, which dominates COMP holdings as of now), then the choice of how to distribute COMP to liquidity pools depends on the vesting structure. A vesting structure that has a number of parameters — length, vesting period, discounts – should be able to accomodate liquidity incentives. If on the other hand, liquidity incentives were given before a vesting choice was made, the protocol would have a harder time choosing what schedule is used as it would need to account for the existing implied discounting factor.
Therefore, we believe that:

A vesting schedule should be flexible enough to provide future liquidity rewards
No liquidity rewards should be administered until vesting has been set.

A modest proposal
Given the desire for the community to have a mechanism for vesting earned COMP, we wanted to put forth two proposals for vesting. These two proposals take two extremes:

Have a fixed period for vesting which saves on gas, but forces LPs to have to compute discount factors
Have continuous vesting, which is more expensive, but makes math for liquidity provisioning much easier

We’ve written two pseudo-code implementations (Vyper-esque pseudo-code) of these two proposals that can be found here. Hopefully the intentions are clear and one can clearly compare the trade-offs. We believe that the first implementation is similar to the description of a vesting period by @jared in a prior forum post
Call for feedback
We would love to hear feedback on these proposals and whether there are other features that are missing and/or if there is another application that causes these options to be malformed.
Footnotes
[0] This factor is chosen if we assume that COMP/USDT, COMP/USDC are geometric brownian motions with well-defined drift, variance. Traders will come up with their own discount factors, but a fixed vesting guarantees that the discount factor will be less than 1, provided they are rational. We note that technically you have to discount both continuous and discrete vesting, but because the discrete vesting has to account for volatility over a long time period it always will over-discount relative to continuous.",92,3773.2,2020-08-25
['Vesting for the Compound protocol'],"I’m having a hard time following this post and I think a more simplistic explanation would be helpful.
Primarily I’m confused if we are only talking about delaying the ability to claim rewards one is owed (this is what I consider to be vesting) or if we are also talking about providing bonus incentives to a certain subset of users who choose to lock their comp? Or if we are talking about both?",70,104.0,2020-08-26

not sure I understand this point, could you expand further? COMP’s volatility vs farming assets doesn’t seem relevant to vesting",68,28.6,2020-08-26
['Vesting for the Compound protocol'],"I believe (and @tarun correct me if I’m mistaken), that the simple “fixed period” vesting would be a regularly scheduled window to claim COMP, e.g. every 60 days. So, February end, April end, June end, etc.
Users would then be forced to judge the future value of COMP (and their desire to hold it in the future) vs using the protocol today. Purely capitalist yield farmers would find this to be more unpalatable than “natural” users. Taken together, the impact of fixed period vesting might be lower usage by farmers, and more rewards for long-term holders.
Did I get that right?",67,33.4,2020-08-26
['Vesting for the Compound protocol'],"I would like a more complicated solution, a vesting contract that allows the owner to delegate/vote before he could claim the COMP in this case a longer vesting period could work.",62,57.4,2020-08-26
['Vesting for the Compound protocol'],"I think the current model works. If the goal of this is to limit the number of people selling COMP regularly, I think it is over complicated and unnecessary. Those who are interested in a vesting solution should write out why and then think what is the best change that can be done to accomplish that is.
The COMP launch has been a huge success. Any changes at this point should be carefully considered.",61,17.2,2020-08-26
['Vesting for the Compound protocol'],"Apologies if I mired the initial explanation with jargon. Here’s what I mean in hopefully simpler terms:
Assumption: A user prefers to receive COMP now rather than later
Concretely: For a user, receiving 1 COMP now is equivalent to receiving 1.1 COMP in a month if you can reinvest the 1 COMP you receive immediately and earn 10% in a month (e.g. via being a Uniswap LP, lending on a venue that lends COMP, etc.)
Analysis

Using this assumption, if you place a cToken in a Uniswap pool and the cToken is earning COMP every block vs. every month, there’s a value difference in the Uniswap pool share (e.g. LP shares with cTokens that vest COMP on every block are valued more than LP shares with cTokens that vest the same amount of COMP every month)
Owning LP shares or placing cTokens in pools means that the value of the liquidity pool share that has a cToken with a COMP / block will be worth more than the one with COMP / month -> you’ll end up w/ different amounts of on-chain liquidity based on the issuance and/or lock-up

Thus, even if COMP never has an incentivized pool (like Synthetix), the choice of how vesting works effects the value of COMP when used elsewhere on chain. If a large portion of the community wants to utilize their COMP in other on-chain financial products, the vesting effect will be quite important to analyze carefully.
Since the precise implementation of how vesting is added to the protocol will effect the time scale, frequency, and amount of user interaction needed for vesting, it is important to keep this effect in mind, especially if the community deems on-chain usage of COMP to be a high priority.
As an explicit example of what might happen if the user has to manually claim vested COMP rewards, consider the Balancer gulp() bug that led to losses due to a deflationary token. While COMP will not have losses of this form, there is an issue if claimComp() is called on cTokens in an LP share a long time post vest. Consider the following numerical example:

cUSDT/USDT price is $1.01 so LP share is worth $1.01 [0]
Earns an average of $0.01 COMP / block

If claimComp() is called every block/continuously vested, then the LP share’s value k blocks after vesting begins is $1.01 + k * $0.01. On the other hand, if the vest happens every 100 blocks, then the price of the LP share at block k is $1.01 + floor(k/100) * $0.01. And if the user forgets to call claimComp(), then there will be a bigger shock to the price of the pool share when the COMP is claimed.
We’re only pointing this out because the continuous (e.g. every block) vs. discrete (e.g. user has to claim ever week/month) vesting schedules will require different levels of COMP holder attentiveness, especially when COMP is in other protocols.
[0] Slightly misleading in that you have to include Uniswap/gas fees on withdrawal, so the price might differ slightly. However, in a low gas price and 0% fee world, this is true.",67,133.4,2020-08-26
['Vesting for the Compound protocol'],"The main point of vesting is two fold:

To incentivize development and security of the protocol, as @arr00 has championed in multiple posts
To incentivize long-term liquidity provisioning

We strongly believe that spending the entire budget of the protocol on liquidity provisioning, as is the current status, is suboptimal. There are a number of components and facets that a protocol’s budget should be spent on, such as (but not limited to):

Security
Incentivized voting participation
Feature development
Insurance Fund / Reserve Management

There is much that DeFi protocols can learn from layer-1 communities that have faced similar issues, albeit without the consistent cash flows of DeFi.",59,46.8,2020-08-26
['Vesting for the Compound protocol'],"I know that speaking about the COMP price is a bit taboo here, but this can’t really be addressed without bringing it up.
I think the main issue here is an irrational market. The current value of COMP is highly inflated due to speculation and limited supply. The large farmers are more likely to be rational actors and that is why they most likely dump their COMP asap.
Vesting could have varying outcomes:

Farmers leave, dropping the TVL massively, causing the price of COMP to plummet, shedding any remaining farmers.
Farmers stay, COMP becomes more scarce, driving up the price of COMP, attracting more farming.
Farmers leave, but COMP is more scarce, leaving the price about the same.

It’s anyone’s guess.
But the more fundamental issue is that governance and price speculation aren’t really compatible.
If you truly want COMP to be a governance token, charge a 10% fee every time it’s transferred. That way it can’t really be traded and will serve it’s real purpose of assigning voting rights to users of the protocol.
If you choose for price speculation, it’s fine to leave things as they are. Let the farmers fill the reserves and keep the TVL high. List some new assets to attracts more capital. Start talking about a way to reward holding COMP with dividends.
This is the real crossroads we’re at. And this seems to be the discussion nobody really wants to have. No need to make the contracts more gassy by adding more bells and whistles.

As a follow-up to this, we [@peteris, @jmo, Rei] just added a PR to the Compound repository for a vesting implementation. It proposes a change to the protocol to add periodic COMP vesting, as per the discussion in this forum post. This will enable the protocol to do the following:

Add vesting for COMP rewards that encourages long-term holding (e.g. akin to Synthetix’s vested reward)
Enables governance to issue COMP grants out of the accumulated COMP (c.f. @rleshner’s post:  A Call to Action)

The current implementation, which will be proposed to be added, also adds a few other features:

Reduced Comptroller size (the size was within 100 bytes of the EIP-170 limit after borrow caps were added) using some of the suggestions from @jared’s post A Leaner, Meaner Comptroller

Independent vesting module: Other projects, not only those using Compound’s governance contract, can adapt the vesting module to their contracts. Contracts that do use Compound’s governance contract (e.g. Uniswap) can take advantage of vesting sooner rather than later

We are excited to get community feedback on this!

['Fix the Compound oracle problem'],"The so called “DAI liquidation event” has shown, that the open oracle, which is used by Compound, has weaknesses. The root cause is, that the oracle uses only one price source, which is Coinbase. The effect is, that the Coinbase prices are used in Compound, even if they deviate largely from the rest of the market. The Uniswap price is used to define a +/- 20% bounding, but as seen, this doesn’t solve the problem.
Imo the only stable solution is, to use several price sources and calculate an average over these sources. Chainlink does exactly this and is used successfully by Synthetix, Aave and others. In the case of DAI/USD chainlink uses 7 price sources, as you can see here.
If Chainlink would have been used as the Compound price source for DAI, the averaged price would have been 1.068, if one price source would have delivered 1.3 like Coinbase and the 6 other sources 1.03, which was the price outside of Coinbase. Any large deviations by some sources are just ironed out.
Beside the above mentioned benefit, using Chainlink would also solve two other disadvantages of the open oracle:

When adding new markets to Compound you are not limited to the coins which are offered by the Coinbase API. Chainlink offers prices for a much large range of coins.
You are no longer dependent on volunteers to post the current prices to the blockchain, which leads to outdated prices. With Chainlink prices are updated regularly automatically.

 wario:

Averaging over low-liquidity sources is not a security improvement.


Chainlink does not take a simple average over exchanges. As I describe in this post, Chainlink oracles fetch data from multiple data aggregators who each provide full market coverage by aggregating from all trading environments (CEXs + DEXs), taking into account volume, liquidity, and time differences between exchanges. Pulling data directly from exchanges and taking a median is not a good way to design an oracle because you’re not taking into account volume shifts across exchanges or new exchanges appearing and capturing a significant amount of the volume. Market coverage is a very nuanced topic and there is a reason why Chainlink doesn’t attempt to create a data quality product and instead focused on the data delivery mechanism. I describe more on the topic of market coverage in this response thread to Hayden from Uniswap.



 wario:

Chainlink is a bad oracle design because the company is incentivized to obfuscate the problem and in doing so adds other layers (aggregators, link nodes) that increase attack surface.


This is simply not true and a bit disingenuous. Chainlink simply wants to provide the DeFi ecosystem with the most secure price oracle solution with the highest quality data and this involves pulling from data aggregators who have full time monitoring teams to ensure manipulation is prevented 24/7. Taking a simple median from a select few exchanges is simply not an adequate oracle solution as it will always be vulnerable to market coverage issues and manipulation attacks around volume shifts and consolidations. As I described in the post linked above, the three layers of aggregation (data level, node level, network level) prevents any single source of truth. Relying on a single source of true is what played a significant factor in the $100M false liquidations of Compound users, and at the very least made the attack much easier and cheaper to pull off.



 wario:

There have already been issues with the unnecessary layers that Chainlink adds, as ocurred with the 6-hour downtime in ETH prices back in March


All decentralized oracles (including Maker and others) went down that day because of extreme Ethereum network congestion that had never happened at that level before. Since then, the transaction manager in Chainlink nodes have been completely revamped to prevent such network congestion issues. When DeFi summer hit and gas prices spiked to 500+ gwei, Chainlink price feeds continued to operate without issue and all applications (Aave and Synthetix included) received accurate data in a timely manner. Pointing to Black Thursday at this point is a bit like pointing to the Shanghai DOS attacks and saying Ethereum isn’t reliable because of it. It was indeed an issue, but it was fixed and made the network stronger against such attacks/issues into the future.



 wario:

If they ever grow to a point equivalent to the current Compound outstading DAI debt in relation to market liquidity, they will face the same market manipulation risks, and other new risks that relate to the unnecessary layers mentioned above.


I think you’re missing the key point of market coverage. The issue with Compound’s oracle during this DAI manipulation attack was that it did not report the true market wide price. If an attacker manipulates the entire market (across every single exchange), then yes all oracles would be affected at that point, but that’s only because the true market wide price was changed, but that’s not what happened during this event, only a single exchange (Coinbase) was manipulated. That’s the nuance here, market coverage raises the cost of attack to highest degree possible, and while it doesn’t prevent market manipulation altogether, but does make it as expensive as possible and ensures protocols always receive the true market wide price.



 wario:

One of the problems with adding the unnecessary layers that Chainlink does is precisely that incentives are not as clearly and directly aligned.


These are not “unnecessary layers” but layers of redundancy to ensure smart contracts always receive price data that reflects the true market wide price and not that of a single or a few exchanges. As I described in my proposal, Chainlink is directly secured by cryptoeconomics through an opportunity cost of losing future income if a node is malicious, as well as losing their reputation as an DevOps infrastructure provider. This is why we have never seen a successful attack against the Chainlink network, because the incentives work and ensure correct data is always posted on-chain.
I hope you and the rest of the Compound governance community reconsider, because if the Compound oracle and its lack of market coverage is not fixed, then oracle issues will continue to appear and will be a waste of time, money, and mental energy to fix every time it happens. Adding more exchanges to the Open Oracle will not solve the problem, because it still won’t provide adequate market coverage for a protocol securing $3B in user deposits. Compound needs the market wide price, just as Aave receives today. This is not a Chainlink shill, this is coming from a DeFi user who does not want to see Compound get exploited due to the lack of market coverage in its oracle. Oracle security is nuanced topic and I’m happy to discuss further.",29,55.8,2020-12-02

H-Tokens(HBTC, HFIL, HDOT…) are assets issued on Ethereum and backed by cryptocurrencies from other blockchains to bring more digital assets to the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem.
HBTC has enabled users to seamlessly access decentralized protocols such as Uniswap, Curve, Nest, CoFix, and ForTube. And its growing use cases prove that the value has been recognized by the market.
The amount of H-Tokens issued and assets reserved and relevant records are open and transparent. To ensure the 1:1 backing is maintained, the amount of H-Tokens issued and assets reserved and relevant records are open and transparent. All activities can be checked here: https://www.htokens.finance/en-us/assets
H-Tokens official website: https://www.htokens.finance/en-us/
HBTC & HFIL Liquidity Venues
Centralized Exchanges: Huobi Global will take the lead in supporting H-series. Users can choose HBTC (or HFIL) when withdrawing their BTC (or FIL). Read this article for A Step by Step Guide: HBTC Withdrawal Guide
Decentralized Exchanges: Curve, Uniswap
Protocols Connected: By now, HBTC and HFIL have been connected to key DeFi protocols like Curve, NEST, CoFiX, Uniswap, ForTube, and YFII. And many other high-quality smart contracts, including AAVE, dYdX and MakerDao, are in negotiation.
DeFi Cases

CoFiX Mining with HBTC: https://medium.com/cofix/we-are-launching-cofix-95d7c056ec63

HBTC and HFIL supported in Fortube (https://for.tube/home ) as collateral and loan asset.
Juan Benet, the founder of Filecoin, praised HFIL on Twitter, thinking that using HFIL and DeFi, anyone can migrate FIL to Ethereum and use smart contracts to handle various things. Miners can rely on DeFi infrastructure and loan market. https://mobile.twitter.com/juanbenet/status/1318217566473445376

HBTC pool is available on Curve since Sep 10th and liquidity providers can then deposit HBTC there to earn trading fee reward and CRV reward. https://www.curve.fi/hbtc/deposit

NEST’s Oracle currently support HBTC. Users can quote and gain nTokens on it. https://nestdapp.io/


Marketcap Ranking
HBTC: ≈ $117M marketcap
HFIL: ≈ $20k marketcap
Advantages

100% Reserve: Make sure that the amount of mortgage assets is always greater than the number of H-Tokens
Multi-Acceptor System
HBTC and HFIL support multi-acceptor acceptance, so users can choose acceptor to transfer in (out) assets more conveniently
More users from Asia Pacific for compound. As H-Tokens gets more users in Asia market, this will bring new users for compound if it is supported

Risks & Weekness

The market cap and liquidity of HBTC and HFIl are relatively low
HBTC is not well-know as WBTC in western countries

Let’s discuss and see if there are questions or concerns about HBTC and HFIL on-borading.",19,78.8,2020-12-01
['Flash loans for comound'],"Introduction
Flash loans have been an amazing asset to the whole DeFi ecosystem by making contracts more resistant to whales. Existing protocols like Aave, dYdX, Uniswap, and some others offer this feature and several bots and users use them on a daily basis for liquidations, arbitrages, and so many other things
Compound is one of the biggest protocols in terms of TVL and users of protocol, we would like to expose assets deposited in Compound for flashloans.
Benefits
There are several benefits in doing so:

Lot of assets become available to flashloan from which makes DeFi ecosystem safer and more robust
Venues for flashloanable assets increase
Compound users earn more interest from fees

So it seems that there are benefits both on the supply and demand side. Another thing to note would be that since adding flashloan doesn’t change how compound actually works it has less implementation and security complexity.
Current work
We as a team of 4 (Vaibhav, Thrilok, Kautuk, Snake) implemented an liquidity pool for compound users where they could deposit their CTokens and expose them for flashloans for the EthOnline hackathon.
WebApp - https://suspicious-jepsen-42efa0.netlify.app/
Youtube Demo - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQoPnqTr8Zc&feature=youtu.be
Github: https://github.com/ethonline-xyz/flashbank
We found out that it’s best to work with compound community and add flash loan natively to reduce the gas costs for users and for the sake of better UX.
Questions for the community

How to deal with non-upgradable CTokens?
How much fees should be charged?
If the fee is charged, where it should be collected?
Should we cap the amount that can be borrowed via flashloans?

['Pls explain real benefit of compound other than spread trading'],"Coming from a finance background, done the initial due diligence on comp, while the process seems safe, i just cant see the real world benefit. Can someone please explain to me:


In the traditional lending business (simplest use cases), borrower receives some type of liquid money and in return pays an interest, a fee, and put up illquid collateral (ie:  real estate, mark to market type assets, certain type of thinly traded bonds)


In compound, in order to borrow coin, borrower needs to put up liquid collateral of the same type of coins supported by compound.  But if the borrower ALREADY has the liquid coins to put up collateral, why the hell would he/she ever wants to lock it as part of collateral, only to pay interest and borrow the coins again?   Why not just use the coins they put up as collateral DIRECTLY for whatever purpose.  It makes no sense to me, why borrow wants to trade 1 type of coin for another type of coin, pay interest, reduced amount due to collateral factor, and take on system risk in case something goes wrong with the compound framework.


What’s the point? why do all this to borrow some coin, when you already have very similar type of asset to start with?
I get the spread trading angle, to make some money off borrow/lender interest rates + paid out compound coins, so dont need to explain that.   But for the use case where compound was designed for…to lend money/coin, how does it make sense as the collateral requirement ensures the only people who can borrow the coin already has the same type of coins.  Ie joe sixpack - a small business owner / first time home buyer / insert any real use case…can never borrow from compound system, as they dont have the liquid coin/money needed to put up a collateral.  And if they did, they will just use the money directly instead…
dont understand. thank you",33,91.6,2020-11-17
['Pls explain real benefit of compound other than spread trading'],"Couple of the most common usecases is to use volatile price asset (usually with high price upside expectation) like ETH, WBTC as a collateral and borrow a stable price asset like USDC, DAI, etc. In reality you can hardly get similar iterest (like 4-6% APY) on something other than stupid mortage in most places around the world. But what if you don’t want to spend money on making somebody else more rich by bying house, but want to make some sort of small business for example, and without billion questions asked “why our amazing bank should give you loan, and why interest should be not high” . Good luck finding 4% APY financing. And what if you are somewhere like Argentina? Or Venezuela?
Of course, you can also use it for pure speculation, like for buying more of an asset you expect to appreciate, but you don’t have to.
Obviously, opposite also works. You can supply stable asset and borrow volatile asset, which you expect to go down. Like you believe bitcoin is worthless and going down to zero? No problem, you can supply USDC, borrow WBTC, sell it now, and when it drops to near zero just pay back that couple dollars  And all the mighty profit is yours.  (obviously not financial advice, just an example.)
Actually there are other usecases than these, if you don’t see them, than i guess it’s your loss, more opportunities for those, who can 
If you don’t realise how many people live in a countries where their currency is not at all stable and they have no chance to even preserve their wealth, set aside increasing it. And now they don’t really need anything other than smartphone and internet connection. Not even a permission from their government.
Crypto currency in general isn’t that much of a deal for first world, like it is for majority of world population living outside of wealthy nations.
And here is quistion: Why would someone, for example, holding bitcoin, scarce, limited supply asset, one of the fastest appreciating assets in the world whould want to sell it, when he can borrow USD against it, at a mere 5% APY, borrow an asset which supply is increasing at an unprecendent in history rate and spend THAT instead? ",33,66.6,2020-11-18
['Pls explain real benefit of compound other than spread trading'],"Here is an example use-case I can think of:
You’ve mined Ethereum in 2016. Now, you want to buy the new RTX 3080, but you don’t have the money to buy it from Amazon in your bank account. So you can either save up money, or you can ask your bank for a loan (10%-25% interest) or you can buy it on credit for 40% interest + fees.
But there is a third option. While still holding onto your ETH (because you think the value will rise) you can lend it to someone and get USDC in return. You have lot’s of ETH, so it’s really not an issue to put up 1000 dollars worth - your not using them anyway. You take the USDC and transfer it into Coinbase, sell it, and transfer it to your bank account, and you pay for the graphics card using dollars on Amazon.
Now skip to a few months later: You have the money, or your remaining ETH has risen in value, so you buy USDC and swap some of your ETH into USDC, and deposit it back into the Compound contract.
And all you had to pay, was 5% APY and various fees for exchanging your crypto and pulling out money to your bank account.
Is it tidious as hell to do this? Yes.
Is that what Compound is being used for right now? Definitely not.
Is it risky to bet on ETH tokens rising in value? Yes.
To comment on @Sirokko; I don’t understand why you have to be passive aggressive. And if you know about any use-cases to get value from using Compound, why not share it with the community so we can all use blockchain-based services more in our everyday life? ",22,34.4,2020-11-26
['Pls explain real benefit of compound other than spread trading'],"Thanks guys, make sense now. The use case is you do not want to sell the crypto you holding - betting it will continue to go up, this let’s you borrow cash against it as collateral.",16,58.2,2020-11-26
['Pls explain real benefit of compound other than spread trading'],"You should look at the project with an “out of the box” mentality first.
I suggest you to review projects like PoolTogether and Yearn Finance as good examples about this mentality.
Both of this protocols use compound finance in a brilliant and smart way.

I am able to keep mined cryptocurrencies and use them as collateral to provide funds (stablecoins) for the purchase and maintenance of mining equipment. A loan-to-value ratio of 75% on an Ehereum deposit is a very good offer.
I think your question is actually why keep crypto like ethereum in the long run. If you set aside complete control over your funds, transaction speed, project availability and cryptographic security - you just need to compare ETH as a bond with traditional bonds.
And of course it makes sense to trust the algorithm more than a board of people made up of people with no “skin in the game”.
Projects like Compound may be in their infancy and mistakes are encountered however solutions are quickly found and decisions are made at the meritocratic level with “SKIN IN THE GAME”.",11,37.2,2020-11-27

Compound Developer Community Call Notes
Wednesday, November 25, 2020
Tarun - Update on Gauntlet’s COMP vesting proposal (starts at 2:45)

Tarun shared an update on the COMP vesting pull request, which is currently under audit. The final audit report should be completed sometime next week, at which point Gauntlet will gather community feedback ahead of a formal governance proposal. The COMP vesting will initially be submitted with a length of 1 block, with the ability of governance to set a longer parameter in the future. This proposal also includes the ability for a COMP streaming grant, distributing COMP from the reservoir to an address over a specific time period.
Once the audit is complete, Tarun is looking for the community to test different COMP vesting and COMP grant parameters in a testnet.

Corbin Page - Potential Compound integration into MetaMask (starts at 5:17)

Corbin discussed the possibility of MetaMask integrating lending protocols like Compound to offer users a “save” button to earn interest, similar to the “swap” feature that they recently rolled out. Corbin also brought up the fact that there are financial institutions who are interested in supplying lots of capital into DeFi, but unsure of smart contract risk and would prefer a risk adjusted return.
Corbin is looking for community feedback on how Consensys could monetize this integration, as well as how to best determine the “proof of loss” in the event of an exploit.

Eitan Katchka | B.Protocol - B.Protocol’s Compound integration (Starts at 25:45)

Eitan and Yaron shared details of B.Protocol, a liquidation backstop mechanism that aims to make liquidations more secure. The protocol incentivizes liquidators to share their proceeds with Compound users, in exchange for certainty in the liquidator selection process.
Eitan and Yaron are looking for community feedback on how to best distribute rewards to Compound users based on protocol usage, as well as thoughts on adding cTokens like cUSDC as collateral. You can read their post on comp.xyz for further context, and read a Medium post from one of the liquidators using the protocol.

Zefram - 88mph’s Compound Integration (Starts at 40:17)

Zefram shared information about the launch of 88mph, which is a fixed rate lending protocol built on top of top floating rate protocols like Compound, Aave, and Yearn.finance. 88mph users are able to either lock in a fixed rate on their deposits or purchase floating rate bonds - all while earning additional MPH rewards.
The 88mph team also built an on-chain oracle that tracks the exponential moving average of interest rates on Compound, Aave, and Yearn.finance. The code for the interest rate oracles is open source, and developers are encouraged to integrate it into their applications.

Prabhaav | SimpleID - Analytics dashboard for Compound users (Starts at 46:26)

Prabhaav shared a demo of SimpleID, an analytics platform for on-chain data from smart contracts like cDAI, cUSDC, Comptroller, etc. Users can create a custom segment of wallets interacting with these smart contracts, and then set up webhooks to push information to a Discord or Twitter bot.
Prabhaav is looking for feedback on which types of data and analytics the Compound community would find interesting, so feel free to message him with your ideas.

Allan | Yield - Yield Protocol roadmap for Compound (Starts at 54:24)

Allan discussed Yield Protocol, a fixed rate lending protocol for DAI that has its own market dynamics, rather than being built on top of other lending protocols.
Allan is looking for community feedback on which assets to support in the next phase of the protocol, and is considering integrating Compound for settlement or supporting cTokens as collateral.

Praneeth - cCOMP Voting (Starts at 58:02)

Praneeth brought up the topic of cCOMP holders being able to participate in Compound governance, similar to how UNI held in Compound can participate in Uniswap governance through the community multi-sig.

"[""Introducing B.Protocol integration (tomorrow at Compound's dev community call)""]","Dear Compound community,
B.Protocol is integrating with Compound and expected to go live in 6 weeks. We are presenting the project tomorrow in the Compound’s discord community dev call, and we would like to get your feedback and questions on the main points below.
What is B.Protocol
B.Protocol (bprotocol.org) is a backstop liquidation protocol, making DeFi lending platforms more stable and scalable with a professional liquidations system. It’s a new lego primitive bringing traditional finance systems best practices into DeFi, aiming to stabilize the ~$15b market of DeFi assets, crucially dependent on adequate liquidation processes, which till now were a missing piece in this growing ecosystem.
We incentivize liquidators (Keepers) to share 50% of their profits with the platform users in return for a certainty in the liquidation process (which is given via a smart contract). By that, we bring more committed liquidators to the platform and help to shift back miners extracted profits (aka MEV) to the users.
Or you can get the PoV of one of our liquidators here (posted today).
Our first integration went live a month ago over MakerDAO, and currently has 12.5k ETH locked (~$7.7m), with 2.8m DAI borrowed by 109 Vault owners.
How B.Protocol benefits Compound

In the short term, Compound gets new big DeFi players as committed liquidators, who will help make it more stable.
In the long run it will allow Compound to offer more attractive collateral factor and higher leverage for its users.

What Compound users get when using Compound via B.Protocol:

Accumulate B.Protocol score.
Get a share of the backstop liquidation proceeds according to their score.
Users will be able to vote on future protocol updates.

Who is behind B.Protocol:
Yaron Velner (me), is the founder and CEO. Previously, I was Kyber Network’s CTO and a co-designer of the WBTC protocol among other things.
Jitendra Chittoda leads the smart contracts. He was previously the head of smart contracts at mStable, worked at Aave, and was an auditor himself in ChainSecurity.
Eitan Katchka leads the community and ecosystem development. Eitan started with decentralized communities and projects in early 2014 as one of the core team members of La’Zooz and has been involved in different blockchain and crypto projects since.
Questions to the community:

Our long term goal is to hand over control of this integration to the Compound users. And we are exploring different ways on how to on-chain measure an activity on Compound, while preventing manipulations and with the technical limitations of being a wrapper atop Compound (and thus, e.g., we cannot simply track the user’s COMP accumulation).
In addition to the coming integration, we plan to propose the Compound community to add a new collateral token cUSDC(2), which will allow USDC deposits, and will be secured by B.Protocol, and would allow x10 leverage. We would like to hear community feedback on what kind of guarantees they would require in order to approve such a new cToken.

We would like to ask the community to share any feedback and ask any questions regarding B.Protocol, whether here or on our Discord.
The current Compound integration code is already open-sourced on GitHub. It is still under development and will be sent for audit in 3 weeks.",21,104.2,2020-11-24

['USDC Collateral Factor increase to 85%'],"Community member @aaaaaaaaaaaaa posted the in the goverance channel of discord: “I think governance voters should demand some better justification for this (and any) change than just your personal beliefs. At a minimum some objective data on why this is safe should be required”
First off, I think proposals are based on personal beliefs and understandings of the protocol/ecosystem. I also believe that voters should vote on their personal beliefs. Because I am the one submitting the proposal, I think the onus on justifying the change is on me. On the same note, it is up to voters to do their own research and ideally independently arrive at their own conclusion.
I appreciate @aaaaaaaaaaaaa criticism, and I will strive to do better.
On that note, let’s talk about USDC.
There are currently 2.8B USDC in existence.


14.5% (408M) of the supply is in Makerdao (Vat).


11.3% (320M) of the supply is in Uniswap’s ETH/USDC pool.


6.7% (136M) of the supply is in BarnBridge.


3.2% (90M) of the supply is in the Curve DAI/USDC/USDT pool.


2.9% (82M) of the supply is in Compound.


1.8% (51M) of the supply is in Aave.


0.80% (22M) of the supply is in Uniswap’s WBTC/USDC pool.


There are many other ETH/USDC pools on other platforms and altcoin/USDC pools. I recommend looking at the top token holders of USDC to see the liquidity.
USDCbloxy1074×411 21.1 KB
The circulating supply of USDC has skyrocketed this year.
YTD the supply is up 548% and the unique holders are up 388%.
With 1inch and Matcha, anyone can see the liquidity that exists right now for any market.


DAI-USDC: better liquidity on 1inch or Match than any exchange.


ETH-USDC: 0.20%-0.40% slippage on $1m trade. (Still better than a lot of exchanges when counting fees)


WBTC-USD: 0.40%-0.80% slippage on $1m trade.


The onchain liquidity that exists today is significantly higher than when Compound v2 launched. None of this accounts for the liquidity that large liquidators have deployed or can deploy quickly. Historically liquidators used their own funds to take part, but thriving AMMs and money markets like Compound & Aave have changed the liquidity landscape and made algorithmic liquidators more tenablele.
USDC liquidity (and many others) has improved significantly. With all of this evidence, it is time to vote to increase the CF for USDC.

['USDC Collateral Factor increase to 85%'],"@getty this hypothetical example might help to see why this is dangerous. And high liquidity actually makes things more dangerous than less dangerous, because with high liquidity, full positions can be liquidated without any capital. (using just flash loans and on-chain trades).
Lets say collateral percentage becomes 85% for USDC.

User deposits 100 USDC to compound
User borrows 85 USDC worth of UNI. Lets assume at this moment price of 1 UNI is 5 USDC, so user ends up borrowing 85 / 5 = 17 UNI.
Lets now say that the price of UNI suddenly jumps to 6 USDC.
Liquidator comes along and liquidates whole 100 USDC position for:
100 / 1.08 / 6 = 15.43 UNI.  (1.08 comes from 8% premium that liquidator gets).
Compound protocol ends up losing: 17-15.43 = 1.57 UNI.

Similar thing can be happen with any other borrowable asset too. (i.e. ETH, WBTC, etc).
So this proposal creates significant extra risk for every user who has deposited non USDC, non stable coin assets to Compound, so it must come with very significant benefits to be worth accepting.",22,24.4,2020-11-13
['USDC Collateral Factor increase to 85%'],"Your argument is mostly valid. With an increased CF, the protocol is certainly taking on more risk. That being said, the protocol is also taking a risk by not offering competitive CFs/assets. I think it is fine that Compound Finance generally lists fewer assets and typically more supported assets, but it should offer more leverage to its users in exchange.
Your example with the USDC/UNI isn’t entirely realistic. The assets on Compound should not being moving 20% in an instant, and if that is possible, I would be voting to delist that asset (I imagine you would as well).",19,3.8,2020-11-14
['Compound/Metamask dashboard GUI error'],"Hey all. I’ve deposited some Dai into compound, my transaction was too slow and I decided to speed it up a bit with some more gwei.  There was some error in metamsk GUI when I confirmed it and now I still see my Dai in Compound dashboard without seeing it deposited while etherscan shows totally opposite that transcaction went smoothly and according to ES I have cDai now.

Compound Developer Community Call Notes
Wednesday, October 28, 2020
Opening (Adam Bavosa)

Adam shared the goals of the call, which are to raise community awareness around what developers are working on (both on protocol improvements and application development) as well as coordinate a roadmap for what to work on next or in the near future.

cChannels (0xRedan)

0xRedan discussed a Layer 2 solution on top of Compound that he built at the HackMoney hackathon. The goal of the project is to optimize L2 before it arrives and incentivize people to use L2 once it is launched. The project is a payment channel that locks funds into Compound by default when they migrate to L2, so users can automatically earn interest while the L2 solution is open.
The name of the project is cChannels, which you can check out on GitHub.

Gauntlet (Tarun and John)

Tarun and John described their pull request that would add vesting to the Comptroller contract. The vesting functionality is meant to be somewhat generic and could be used to disincentivize recycled borrowing as well as issue payments/grants to developers. While building, they found that the Comptroller is close to its max size limit, so they are working with Jared to remove a lot of code from the contract to make room for new functionality like vesting.
The long term solution would be to refactor the entire Comptroller to make it easier for future upgrades. They are working with Quantstamp to audit the vesting changes, as well as looking at splitting up the Comptroller contract so the size limit of the contract isn’t an issue moving forward.
Gauntlet is looking for feedback on vesting and the Comptroller reductions, which you can view on Github.

Split (Francesco and James)

Francesco and James showed a demo of their ETHOnline Hackathon project called Split, which deconstructs cTokens into its component parts - a capital component and a yield component (example: cETH into ccETH and ycETH). Splitting tokens enables new market-neutral yield assets, creates unique income flow opportunities, and provides levered directional trades. Split doesn’t currently account for COMP, but the next step for the team is adding a governance component.
Check out Split.finance to try it out the application and let the team know if you have any feedback.

Comp.vote (TennisBowling and Arr00)

TennisBowling and Arr00 are working on gasless voting and delegating using signatures on Comp.vote. The UI is still being worked on so feel free to submit a PR. You can also reach out to Ar00 on Discord if you are interested in using the publicly exposed comp.vote API.

Flashbank (Thrilok and Vaibhav)

Thrilok and Vaibhav worked on Flashbank in the ETHOnline hackathon, which aims to bring flash loans to Compound. They are planning to start with cDAI rather than change the Comptroller contract, since the cDAI contract is upgradable and other contracts like cUSDC are not. The team is looking for advice on whether to charge fees, as well as help with the draft governance proposal.
View the Flash Bank website or this video to learn more about the project, and reach out to the team if you’re interested in helping them submit a governance proposal.

Governor Beta (0age)

0age works with Dharma and is thinking about a better Governor contract (Governor Beta). The Governor Beta would include a proposal delay, the ability for the proposer to cancel a proposal in process, upgradable governance parameters that won’t break connected interfaces, and a new way to configure voting of cCOMP that doesn’t rely on voting as a pool. The end goal would be an improved governance system that could benefit both Compound and Uniswap.
0age is looking for community feedback on Governor beta, so reach out to him on Discord with any ideas.

Asset Risk (Getty Hill)

Getty wrote a blog post on updating the collateral factor mechanism for each asset and is thinking more broadly about better ways to assess asset risk. Markets could be more efficient

['HUSD Listing Proposal'],"Hi All, I am here to submit my proposal for adding HUSD to compound.
I saw proposals from GUSD, TUSD on this forum, and I do think HUSD is an asset worth considering.
HUSD Overview
Category: U.S. dollar backed strablecoin
Issuer: Stable Universal limited
Custodian: Paxos Trust
Backed by: U.S. Dollar, 1:1 ratio
Audit: Withum, monthly
Year of Issuance：July,2019
HUSD is an ERC-20 token that is 1:1 ratio pegged with USD. It was issued by Stable Universal.
To ensure the 1:1 backing is maintained, monthly audits of HUSD are conducted by an independent US audit firm. The reports can be checked here:https://www.stcoins.com/attestation/index

Advantages


The market and users of HUSD is quite different from the stablecoins on compound,  which can provide diversify for the platform, and lower the systematic risks. Sicne for the centralized stablecoins, USDT, USDC and HUSD are facing different market and different legal/compliance requirements.


More users from Asia Pacific for compound. As HUSD gets more users in Asia market, it will bring new users for compound if it is supported.


Risks & Weekness

The market cap and liquidity of HUSD is relatively lower than USDT, USDC,DAI
HUSD is not well-know as USDT, USDC,DAI in western countries

Let’s discuss to see if there is any questions or concerns about HUSD on-borading.",16,28.2,2020-11-01

My intention was to send the bats to my Metamask account, I copied my address from metamask and then pasted it into Binance, but something happened and for some reason the tokens went to a Compound account, my worst mistake and which I regret more It is that when I received the email from binance to approve the withdrawal of the bats, I approved it without first checking if the address was correct.
Please appreciate if someone from the compound team can help me in this regard to see if those BATS can be recovered.

MakerDAO’s recent flashloan voting event goes to show how governance mechanism design is very important. I wanted to start this thread to brainstorm some pros/cons and potential corner cases for various changes to the governance system.
Please share any ideas below ",32,246.4,2020-10-29
['[Discussion] Governor Beta'],"Starting this off;
I’m a little skeptical of a proposal delay being built into the system. Is there a risk of people borrowing COMP from the cCOMP market right before the snapshot block to swing a vote?",32,11.4,2020-10-29
['[Discussion] Governor Beta'],"I find this to be an interesting argument. In the existing process, the proposers have “insider” information. They can accrue additional votes before proposing.

['[Discussion] Governor Beta'],Maybe the COMP token should be split out into a voting component/token and an economic interest component/token.  The latter would be for any future distributions or drops and reflect economic interest in the protocol (sort of like nonvoting shares); it could be used as the main collateral component for now.  Both could trade independently.  Might help avoid some of these issues with borrowing COMP to influence votes.,26,5.2,2020-10-30
['PowerIndex Grant Program for the Compound Protocol'],"Hello, Compound community! We publish this post as Compound is one of the most likely participants of PowerIndex, a decentralized Defi ETF-like product. Currently, COMP token is a participant of PowerIndex MVP version - Baby PowerIndex.
Baby PowerIndex is a Smart Defi Index, composed of 8 governance tokens (YFI AAVE SNX COMP MKR UNI WNXM CVP). Currently, it is an unaudited MVP version live in mainnet, so everyone can play with it to see how it works. It has a certain liquidity cap ($550k) which is completely filled by our community.
For the main PowerIndex (uncapped audited version) token set will be defined by community voting. For the end-user, index share is represented by PIPT (PowerIndex Pool Token), which allows users to operate with a basket of 8 tokens using a single token.
We call this index a “smart” one due to the following features:

All pooled tokens can be used for governance (voting) in composite protocols.
All pooled tokens can be used for fund management strategies. All cashflows are distributed to the token holders. Also, index LPs mine CVP (the Concentrated Voting Power tokens, which integrate all pooled voting power of composite protocols) as additional source of income.
Community can entirely govern the index, changing token set, weights of tokens, and pool fees via proposals.

Compound protocol and its community will get certain value if COMP will be added into the index:

The end-users of the index (Defi community) will get a stake in COMP simply buying PIPT. Any PIPT holder will be a COMP holder.
Index stores all governance tokens in a special contract (check out Baby PowerIndex contract). All pooled tokens are used by PowerPool (CVP) token holders for voting on proposals (we call this process meta-governance). As all pooled tokens will vote at every Compound voting, this will contribute to solving the Voters’ Apathy problem.
As PIPT is an interest-collecting token (cashflows will be generated by using pooled tokens in fund management strategies), liquidity providers will receive additional cashflows by providing their governance tokens, for example COMP to the index.

In addition to the mentioned cashflows, all LPs will earn CVP tokens for provided liquidity according to the CVP LM program.

PowerIndex allows swap tokens which are pooled inside the index contract. So, addition of COMP into the index would allow to swap other governance tokens to COMP and vice versa without any intermediary trades, boosting its liquidity.
As a result of index capitalization growth, a lot of COMP tokens will be pooled inside the contract, which will help to maintain COMP market price acting as a supply sink.

The PowerIndex participants grant program
Today we are proud to announce the grant program for PowerIndex composite protocols and Protocol Politicians, elected by their communities. Allocation of these grants was approved by the CVP community in Proposal 6.
This program is aimed to establish community partnership. It will engage communities interaction and bring additional value for Compound token holders and its governance system and PowerPool meta-governance protocol.
It is planned to allocate as much as 1% of CVP supply (1m CVP) to each protocol, which will be elected as PowerIndex member in upcoming community voting.
This grant will be divided into two parts: the main one (900k CVP) will be under control of the Compound community and the rest of it (100k) will be divided into individual grants for two Compound active and trusted community members - we name such persons a Protocol Politicians.
Two grant recipients will be elected by the protocol’s community. PowerPool itself and CVP token holders have nothing to do with that.
The purposes of grants allocation
As it was stated in a recently published article, there is no real democracy without rewards. In common words to achieve a high level of participation in the on-chain governance the community needs to be motivated and engaged enough.
Meta-governance is not only about accumulating governance tokens inside the protocol. It is about the proper people’s organization and motivation.
Since the community is the key for meta-governance (while pooling GT liquidity is a necessary but not sufficient condition for building such a system), we decided to provide leverage in PowerPool votings for every composite protocol.
So, the community of each composite protocol would be able to have its own loud voice and defend their interests in any PowerPool proposal.
From one side, it will engage the community of these protocols into PowerPool governance, and from the other one will provide an opportunity for index participants to create a sort of coalition and influence index management.
To enhance this community engagement effect, we decided to allocate 100k CVP for two protocol politicians from each protocol. These grants will be individual ones.
Rules of individual grants allocation:

A person should be elected by the protocol community. For example, Protocol Politicians from Compound should be elected by the Compound community
There are no restrictions: Protocol Politicians can be protocol team members, majority token holder, minority token holder, accidentally PowerPool’s alpha/beta/gamma tester. Only the community decides who will be elected.
Protocol Politicians from composite protocols aren’t required to have a CVP stake.
Each protocol can define their own rules of resignation in case of Protocol Politician misbehavior. We will discuss options for that with each protocol team individually (note, granted tokens would be anyway on a vesting contract).

Basic duties of Protocol Politicians:

To act as a diplomat between his own protocol and PowerPool - helping with communication between communities, including community calls, intro(s) if necessary, establishing collaboration on mutual research, articles, tweets, announcements, etc.
To inform community members about future and ongoing development, proposals, community activity, etc. People from Compound and PowerPool need to be aware of activity in both protocols.
To help with community-based technical integration. Here it means to facilitate all stuff related to community-driven tech development.
Supporting community partnership. We consider protocols, which are exchanged with Protocol Politicians as partnered on the basis of community needs.
Any other duties, specified by the community of the composite protocol. Each protocol can add their own duties and tasks for Protocol Politicians.

Roadmap for Grants
The roadmap for grants depends on the main PowerIndex launch roadmap. It is presented below:

Posting on governance forums of protocols, which probably could become PowerIndex composite protocols. We expect it will take ~2-4 days from now. Until voting (the point 2 of this list) passes, all stuff regarding the election and resignation processes will be discussed on community forums.
Community voting on PowerIndex composition (~7-14 days from now).
Final election of Protocol Politicians, preparation of protocol’s treasures to use CVP voting rights in PowerPool governance. Integration of new sources of votes into PowerPool modular governance system
Launch of audited and uncapped PowerIndex
Distribution grants to the vesting contract, enabling all granted tokens for voting

['Add support for Rari Capital tokens'],"Summary: Add support for Rari Capital tokens as borrowing collateral
Rari Capital, a robo-advisor protocol that takes deposited assets and reallocates them into the highest yield opportunities (already has Compound integrated) just launched v2 of their product.
With three pools, stable, yield, and ETH, each catering to a different risk portfolio or asset exposure, they have several ecosystem tokens, similar to cDai (represents 1 stablecoin deposited + interest). We have also launched their governance token, $RGT, and its public liquidity mining program. With how accessible $RGT earning is (just have to deposit into the platform), Compound should add all four tokens (3 pool tokens and RGT) as collateral for borrowing. This would allow Rari depositors to then borrow against their Rari tokens and increase borrowing demand, increasing interest rates, and volume.
This is an early-stage idea, and I don’t have a formal proposal yet, however, I believe this to be a good first step.

['Lower Gas by Removing COMP Auto Distribute!'],"We’ve kicked around this idea before (Robert suggested it) and I think it’s time to do it.
My understanding is removing COMP auto distribute would save approximately 40k gas. That’s a meaningful amount! I can’t think of any dependencies removing this would break so downsides are ???
@jared do you have any thoughts on how difficult or risky it might be to make this change?
Mostly I think we just need to pay someone to do the work! Assuming it is fairly simple perhaps we consider a $2,500 bounty?
Right now we are averaging ~800 deposits / withdrawals per day (as evidenced by Comptroller COMP daily transfers). So 800 x 40,000 gwei = 0.032 ETH per day that would be saved by removing this function.",40,208.0,2020-10-13
['Lower Gas by Removing COMP Auto Distribute!'],"The easiest thing to do is just raise the threshold from .001 COMP to e.g. 1 COMP. It’s a constant, so it would require a Comptroller upgrade, but otherwise should be extremely safe and easy as an isolated change. Some tests may require updating.",39,57.8,2020-10-14
['Lower Gas by Removing COMP Auto Distribute!'],"This is a joke, isn’t it? So there is a plan to remove COMP autodistribute so user can save 40k GAS per transaction, so in order to actually claim COMP user would need to pay 500k+ GAS by utilizing collect function instead of much much cheaper supply/borrow transaction? So much for savings indeed. Unless claiming COMP function would use like 100k GAS i think removing auto-claim doesn’t really sound awesome.
800 x 40000 metric is useless, as what matters is savings per user. If every user saves very little per transaction, but probably would end up paying more by having to use more gas-intensive function, and protocol itself isn’t actually gaining anything, doesn’t sound like much of optimisation to me.
On the other hand, raising threshold from 0.001 to at least 0.01 and maybe even something between 0.01 and 0.1 to not really waste a gas on every penny of COMP able to be claimed, sounds reasonable.
I guess there’s pretty much nobody wanting to pay 40k gas additional to claim 0.001x100 = aprox about 0.1$ valuation of COMP, as user actually lose money on that operation. 1 COMP threshold might be too big for many users though, i’d suggest something lower, like 0.1 COMP or maybe even 0.05 COMP.
EDIT: What would be really nice though, if there would be a checkmark for user to include auto-claim in transaction or not. Like if switch is TRUE, then include autoclaim, if it’s FALSE, then skip it and proceed without auto-claim. I think that solution would be the best way to go.",29,10.8,2020-10-16
['Lower Gas by Removing COMP Auto Distribute!'],"Claiming COMP in general does not cost 500k Gas. I recently claimed COMP on one of my addresses for 150k gas. I believe that the gas savings for completely removing COMP auto-claim would be well worth it.
The incredibly gas intensive claimComp operation claims COMP for all Compound markets. An optimized frontend would not call that function–rather it would call more specific claimComp functions which can only claim COMP for certain markets.",27,25.4,2020-10-16
['Lower Gas by Removing COMP Auto Distribute!'],"Well, maybe it cost 150k gas for you, but when you press claim it requests gas limit of over 900k, which while might not use all 900k, but it’s definetly cost multiplies of what it cost by using auto-claim via supply/borrow transactions. So in general, it will surely cost more for pretty much every average Joe out there.
And yes, i’m against removing that feature, because with it being absent it becomes more expensive to claim COMP. And while it might be less efficient for me, as not every interaction with compound actually need to use gas for claiming, it’s still cheaper overall, than what original post suggest by completely removing it.
Again, if someone thinks he would be better without, fine. But there are other people who think they are better with, and i bet there are more of the second ones.
Of course, it doesn’t mean that threshold shouldn’t be changed, as claiming dust amounts of COMP benefit nobody and it was set too low indeed. Optional claim would be best feature here really. Or separate function which could be called for individual market, as you mentioned. But that thing isn’t there yet, so that talks about let’s remove cheap way of claiming right now is actually sounds  like let’s reduce COMP distribution rate, because we might use it for something else in future. Ok, COMP distribution reduced, nothing appeared.  Don’t anybody think it’s strange way of making changes? Why not implementing certain market claim function first, and then can remove auto-claim as not anymore needed feature. Cause right now i prefer paying little extra gas for every transaction, rather than having to use claimComp function and paying several times more. And hoping that some day, over a horizon, might come a time, where a cheaper claim function would exist. And all of that for mighty savings of like 0.5$ per compound interaction transaction.
Don’t get me wrong here, though, i might sound a bit saulty as that suggestion planning to make interactions with Compound more expensive for me, rather than cheaper, but i’m all for improvements, when it’s actually an improvement. That idea, isn’t a clear improvement. At least not yet, not here and now as protocol and frontend exist today.",27,20.4,2020-10-16
['Lower Gas by Removing COMP Auto Distribute!'],"The protocol already has the code implemented for cheap COMP claims. Look at this function. It costs about 150k gas to call it for one market right now. I’m sure that if we remove the auto claim feature, the compound frontend would quickly implement an optimized version of the claim button.",26,40.2,2020-10-16
['Lower Gas by Removing COMP Auto Distribute!'],"Thanks for link. It’s good news for me, indeed.
That solves major objection, but you see, thing is it’s still 150k, vs 40k addition to regular transaction. Which surprisingly makes auto-claim feature more efficient option when it is desired. Now if we could have this auto-claim code execute optionally, rather than always, with default being disabled, that would be a nice improvement and a middle-ground. Cause surely, if you plan to do supply and claim transaction and can pay additional 40k to do it in one transaction, rather than making separate transaction it would be more cost effective.Don’t you think removing existing, but useful for certain users in certain situations code might be not exactly best way in the end?",26,5.2,2020-10-16

"['A Leaner, Meaner Comptroller']","With ETHOnline in full gear and Compound sponsoring bounties, its a good time to talk about some relatively low-hanging fruit when it comes to reducing the code size of the Comptroller and unlocking other major protocol enhancements.
The Comptroller is the core risk management contract of Compound v2. All CTokens interact with Comptroller, at least once, before allowing users to take action. As such, modifying Comptroller is one of the most powerful ways one could upgrade the protocol (for instance, that’s how we added the autonomous COMP distribution to all users).
But if you’ve tried to perform a Comptroller upgrade recently, then you know that it’s very hard to add any features to it at this point, without going past the code size limit for Ethereum contracts. As the protocol has evolved, some parts of the Comptroller have stood the test of time better than others.
Here’s a few ideas for simplification, that could make a big difference in the ability to add new and exciting features to the Comptroller.
Simplification Ideas
Remove _setCompRate / refreshCompSpeeds, Add _setCompSpeeds

When we launched the COMP distribution, we thought a simple but fair way to distribute COMP would be proportional to the total borrow interest paid by each market, since that was also a metric we thought important to the protocol. Within a week, we were convinced a better metric would be raw total borrows rather than interest.
In retrospect, it’s probably even better to let governance directly choose the relative incentives for each market, rather than having them converge on some path-dependent equilibrium state. When we built the refreshCompSpeeds mechanism, we had also considered this possibility, which is perhaps why it’s relatively easy to remove.
By deleting _setCompRate and refreshCompSpeeds, we can eliminate a bunch of complexity from the Comptroller. What remains is then to add a simple setter method _setCompSpeeds, to directly set the compSpeeds storage for each market.
Remove _setMaxAssets

This one looks like a relatively easy win, if governance agrees that this (unused) ability is not likely to be useful in the future either. It should be as simple as the heading suggests.
Eliminate ErrorReporter/Exponential
The original v2 protocol made heavy use of our legacy error handling and Failure logs in order to indicate to users the source of issues during transactions. Soon after launch, revert messages started being displayed properly on etherscan, and eventually we adopted the modern error-handling via revert mechanism.
However, not all code has been rewritten for the newer, less verbose style, as all code changes come with a cost. At this point, to the extent which the ErrorReporter contract can be removed, it probably should be.
Coupled closely to this issue is the way the protocol does math. The COMP distribution added a few new math functions to Exponential, which could be used for all the math in Comptroller. Likewise, different contracts are using different pieces of the math libraries, if Comptroller were restricted to only including the functions it actually relies upon, it could go a long way in terms of code size savings.
The easiest place to start with something like this might be in e.g. _setCloseFactor, which is a mostly unused function with a lot of verbose checks. It should be rather straightforward to upgrade this function and reduce code size.
A harder change might be e.g. getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityInternal, since that function is used everywhere, and it is inherently a more complex function. Nonetheless the approach is the same and the good thing is these changes would not affect the interface.
Other Advice
Do NOT Modify Storage
In general, the upgrade process works by replacing the logic contract, while continuing to use the same storage contract. Thus, the storage is something that exists between generations of Comptroller code, and it’s important not to modify the contract storage layout when you make upgrades. In general, storage should only be appended to, never deleted.
As long as you don’t modify ComptrollerStorage.sol, this shouldn’t be a problem.

['Helping to bring more real-world users to Compound - Three new product ideas for the Compound community'],"Summary: Compliantly facilitating identity and legacy data-linked borrowing and lending, whose transparent and efficient markets are powered by automated governance, will help usher in the next 100,000+ Compound protocol users. One method of capturing this opportunity is by creating products and markets that allow one to draw under collateralized debt from DeFi markets by using the credit risk data they have today. Towards this end, the community and/or the Compound team, by way of governance or other routes, could create three net-new products within the Compound ecosystem:

The COMP Profile
Identity-linked Compound Assets (“ilCOMP Assets”)
Compound Interest Rate Pools (“ciPools”)

Idea 1: The COMP Profile

Ethereum address and/or ENS.
Personally identifiable information to facilitate proper KYC and compliance processes (SSN/Passport image). (Potentially use Nexus Mutual’s KYC process as a guide. See their whitepaper, page 12, section header name “Identity”)
Credit score inputs from Experian, Equifax, and/or Transunion. (Potentially seek to turn these providers into information oracles where credit data is tokenized and callable)
All financial activity data of borrowers would be linked to the COMP profile which can then be exported across decentralized finance markets (potentially both inside & outside of Compound). This could start the foundation of a self-sovereign on-chain credit bureau.

Idea 2: Identity-linked Compound Assets (“ilCOMP” Assets)

Assets that are created within Compound’s money markets, are non-transferrable, and that are tied, upon minting, to a specific COMP profile (Here forward referred to as “ilCOMP assets” and/or “identity-linked Compound assets”).
ilCOMP assets use an individuals’ legacy financial information (credit scores, etc.) to programmatically calculate, via automated community governance, COMP profile-specific individualized debt ceilings or “IDC’s”. IDC’s are updated dynamically and can persist as a field within an individuals’ COMP profile.
Upon minting of ilCOMP assets, an on-chain undercollateralized compound debt (or “UCD”) is created in equal proportion to the amount of ilCOMP assets minted by the COMP profile.
ilCOMP assets and their corresponding UCD’s are interest bearing and accruing, but with fixed rates & durations. These fixed rates and durations are determined by the “ciPOOL” used in the ilCOMP asset minting process (further explained below in Section 3, #1).
At the stated expiration, the “undercollateralized compound debt” is either paid back, defaulted on, or the borrower posts enough collateral to “continue the debt” at the market floating interest rate seen in current Compound markets.
ilCOMP assets are burnable and only redeemable at partner exchanges for USD via a governance process in order to disincentivize, prevent, and rectify fraudulent activities.
Undercollateralized compound debts (UCD’s) are NFT’s and thus can be tokenized. As a result, exposure and risk to UCD’s can be spread out across multi pool lenders and dynamically priced by market participants.
Interacting with ilCOMP assets does not bar a user from interacting in Compounds’ legacy markets.

Idea 3: Compound Interest Rate Pools (ciPools)

The pool of available capital for borrowing, or the “ciPools”, is supplied by lenders to various liquidity pools. Each pool mints ilCOMP assets with set expiration dates and a market-rationalized fixed interest rates. For example, lenders supplying capital to “Pool A” are aware of the fixed interest rate and duration of that pool and by definition all of the UCD positions drawn from that pool. Once “Pool A” is fully committed, new pools can be formed in the view according to market demand and by collective governance action.
Safe, sensible, and trusted liquidity mining campaigns could potentially be used to incentivize initial set(s) of lenders into and borrowers from the various ciPools.

Other Information:

Past the point of these ideas shown above, the self-sovereign COMP profile could mark a first step in making it easier for individuals to remove a legacy banking institutions’ required participation from the borrowing process by creating a truly direct application process.
A similar but tangential opportunity exists where banks may be able to offer services (UCD’s) to customers by tapping into Compound’s Markets. If successfully executed, this would further deepen the depth of markets on Compound.

['Proposal 27: Adding COMP as an asset'],"@blck and I plan to propose adding COMP as a new asset in the coming days. Please read this thread for previous discussion on the topic.
The cCOMP (Compound Collateral) contract is deployed here and uses the same CCompLikeDelegate implementation contract as cUNI (here).
cCOMP uses a new JumpRateModelV2 interest rate model with the following parameters:

2% APY borrow base rate
20% APY borrow rate at kink
Kink at 80% utilization
100% APY borrow rate at 100% utilization

We propose a 20% reserve factor and collateral factor of 60% inline with cUNI. Additionally, we plan to set an initial borrow cap of 50k COMP.
A new PriceFeed is not needed for this new market, as the current price feed already supports COMP. The addition of the new market is simulated in a fork using this notebook (a fork of @jared notebook), ensuring expected behavior.
The following call was used to deploy the cCOMP contract:

The primary question that the community should ask, is how borrowed COMP could interfere (or, improve) Governance:

Proposals require 100k COMP to be held for the life of the proposal; this prevents flash-borrow attacks, but not borrowed COMP attacks.
Voting weight is measured at the beginning of a proposal; you can’t borrow COMP to sway an ongoing vote.
Could risks be limited with a borrowing cap?

If I had to guess, Bart’s motivation is enabling new mechanisms to short COMP. That’s not a bad thing (efficient markets are strong markets), and a borrowing market for COMP could unlock new use-cases that haven’t been considered, too.",68,103.6,2020-07-31
['Adding COMP as an asset?'],"I think it might be good time to come back to discussing addition of COMP market, though i would like to look at it at different angle.
First i would like to address market liquidity. That’s a moot argument. It was presented with WBTC first AND proven wrong. There’s not sufficient market liquidity BECAUSE there’s no market implementation. So as long as there’s no market, liquidity WILL be low obviously. Was same with WBTC for month with liquidity never coming. Compound COULD fix it itself with enabling  WBTC as collateral, but that was actually addressed first by MAKER team, by adding the WBTC vault, and as soon as there appeared usability, capital went there creating liquidity, hitting their vault caps multiply times.
Concern about WHAT if someone would be able to borrow COMP from market and use it for creating proposals/ voting. I guess we never know before it comes, AND the thing is IT DOESNT ALREADY MATTER what Compound do. Since CREAM.finance already implemented that market and it already can be used for that, and while liquidity might not be enough yet, it will get there eventually no matter if Compound itself create that market or not. Besides you don’t really need to borrow COMP, you can borrow some stable coin and temporarily buy COMP with that. And that not necessarily would be more expensive than borrowing COMP, likely even cheaper, might even end in profit if market buying push price high enough, and then you can slowly sell it back higher. So that possibillity kind of always was there, and probability will just increase with more COMP created and entereng market daily.
But that’s not my main point. I want to higlight the benefits of having COMP market.
Many people mentioned that it would be nice if Compound protocol would reward COMP holders. And i think this is great way how. Compound could adapt some of the methods “food tokens” utilise and benefit from them. If someone not aware how it’s done, the idea is quite simple: User provide COMP to supply side of COMP market and recieve cCOMP tokens. User than “stake” (timelock) that tokens and recieve reward in COMP distributed to the pool of that “staked” tokens. For visual example how it could work, you can check cream.finance and their native CREAM token. By that initiative basically several things are achieved, creating liquidity in supply side, locking that liquidity (user can’t unstake it prematurely and thus can’t remove COMP from supply pool) and rewarding of long term holding of COMP.
But more than that, i believe the system could be improved. Compound could have longer timelock on staked pool tokens. Like 3 months, 6 month, 1 year which could recieve bigger rewards for longer lock of tokens. Maybe even locked tokens could give weighted votes in governance. For example, 1 year locked COMP tokens could have 2x voting weight or something like that, ensuring that long standing commitment have a bigger voice out there.
Now  from where  COMP tokens to reward that initiative should come? Well that’s quite simple, from that same pool of tokens which are now distributing via liquidity mining initiative. I see couple of ways to do that, we can either reduce emission speed OR “cut the tail”, keep emission speed same but shorten the time, like not 4 years of distribution, but like 3 years, 9 months. Either way is fine and could be voted on details.
Maybe some of you noticed that i was strongly against reducing emission. Well i’m not against reduction itself, i’m against “just reduce it so we could possible use it for something else”. I believe we should FIRST have that something else, and then we could reduce emission to secure funding. But if there’s nothing else existing yet, than emission shouldn’t be touched yet as well.
And from financial stand point ability to “stake” cCOMP tokens timelocking them in staking pool will remove a portion of tokens from circulation on market likely helping the price. But that’s not really main point, rather an additional benefit for COMP community.
Last it’s a bit strange that Compound don’t support market for it’s own governance token. Is it not enough confidence in own token?",45,59.0,2020-09-12
['Adding COMP as an asset?'],"I’d like to get this done soon. I think we should deploy the current development branch version of CCompLikeDelegate and CErc20Delegator using this commit. It uses previously deployed code for the CErc20Delegator for reasons stated in this PR.

['Adding COMP as an asset?'],"Arr00,
This is exciting, thanks for stepping up to make a new cToken & proposal!
For Collateral Factors, historically this has been an analysis based on the liquidity and volatility of the asset. Gauntlet has done extensive work analyzing these risks for the Compound protocol (cc @tarun), and their input here could be very useful.
A Borrow Cap makes a lot of sense, and is a great way to test the new technology! This could start low and increase as the market scales, and there is more information on the market’s impact on Governance. Throwing a simple poll in to gauge the community’s thoughts:




0 COMP (can’t borrow)
10,000 COMP
25,000 COMP
50,000 COMP
80,000 COMP
No Borrow Cap




0
voters




The USDT Interest rate model is a good place to start; it’s already deployed, and becoming canonical. That being said, more work is needed to analyze the optimal rate models for collateral assets.
In terms of Reserve Factors (always a contentious topic), 20% is lower than the RFs on collateral assets, but seems to be in-line with where the community wants to take RFs going forward for collateral.",34,6.8,2020-09-23
['Adding COMP as an asset?'],"I’m starting to think that might be a bit more tricky for governance token. To the point that we might be possibly interested in having 2 different markets for COMP tokens. In some way it applies to other governance tokens too, but since COMP is native governance token of Compound that should be our primary concern. My primary focus on having COMP market isn’t really about providing borrow opportunity, but more of:

Enabling COMP holders to use their tokens as collateral
Preserving ability to vote, by keeping voting power from that tokens during supply
Potentially providing reward initiatives by locking COMP tokens for different time-frames.

And here we come to a problem if we are having a borrow side of COMP pool. We can’t preserve voting power for original owner, because the very same tokens could be borrowed from pool and borrower would expect voting power to come with them.
That could be addressed if we not allow cTokens from that pool to be borrowed. So basically they would be able to serve as collateral AND preserve voting power to original Supplier, as well as be timelocked in that pool, but by doing so we lose abililty for them to be borrowed.
Or we could allow them to be borrowed like traditional markets, but then supplier have to forfeit their voting rights for the duration of his supply.
Or maybe there could be 2 types of cComp, one with preservation of voting power and another with not. What is more important for future of protocol, preserving voting power for suppliers, or ability to borrow COMP as i don’t think we could have both in one cToken. Or am i missing something here?",29,20.8,2020-09-25
['Adding COMP as an asset?'],"Yes, I agree with your concerns; however, due to implementation constraints, enabling COMP as collateral while still using it for voting would be difficult and require a lot of new code.
The cCOMP market will have the ability to delegate its liquidity. If the community would like, we can setup the delegation to the community multisig and have off-chain voting based on a cCOMP snapshot. This will allow cCOMP holders to still have a say in governance. This is a solution to the issue you identified: maintaining voting ability while allowing borrowing.
In the future, I hope to see additional ways to use COMP in the Compound ecosystem such as staking COMP to receive more COMP. In this scenario, we will setup a system in which the user will maintain their COMP voting/delegation rights.

['Set WBTC Collateral Factor to 60%'],"2nd Autonomous Proposal: This change increases the Collateral Factor of WBTC from 40% to 60%.
On July 14th, proposal 16 was passed to raise WBTC’s Collateral Factor from 0% to 40%. According to Defi Pulse, on July 14th there were ~$100M of WBTC in circulation. Today there are ~$900M of WBTC in circulation. In addition to having a much larger supply today, WBTC liquidity has significantly grown since proposal 16 was passed. Uniswap.info shows WBTC on July 14th with a total liquidity of ~$1.15M while today it has ~$230M.
With this starkly increased liquidity and demand, it makes sense to increase the WBTC collateral factor. Even with this proposed increase to 60%, the WBTC collateral factor would still be significantly under that of DAI, USDC, and ETH, which are each 75%.

Core Code Changes
All code changes for the Compound Protocol should be created as a pull request on https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol. If you’re proposing a change to the protocol that will not immediately go live (e.g. a feature improvement) then make your pull requests against the develop branch. If your pull request is intended to be merged only after the change is made (e.g. supporting a new token) then make your change against master. That is, master always refers to what is deployed to Ethereum, but develop may be advanced without a corresponding change to master.
For cUNI, we made the following changes:
First, we reverted changes to our delegator contract that had a minor bug affecting the output size of certain function calls. This change should have been merged into develop, but was not yet merged in. You can view the pull request here.
Next, we added a new CToken Delegate contract. Specifically, the cUNI contract is what we call a CTokenDelegator (it has upgradable functionality controlled by a CTokenDelegate contract). This is to mirror behavioral changes in UNI. A CCompLikeDelegate contract was added in this pull request, which allows the admin of the CToken to call a _delegateTo function, which will allow the cToken to vote its UNI tokens.
We added proper unit tests for this function. As the function does not significantly differ or introduce any likely regressions, we chose to peer-review and internally audit the change; for larger changes, you should consider contracting an auditor (that can be tipped, or reimbursed in the proposal, using protocol resources).
Once these pull requests were created and reviewed, we could move on to deploying the contracts to test-net and integrating them into the Compound Protocol on Ropsten.
Deploying to Testnet
There are multiple ways to deploy to test-net. You can follow the same procedure you would use for main-net (see below), but there is also Eureka, which is a tool similar to Terraform for Ethereum contracts. With a change in configuration to Eureka, you will be able to push your new token to all of our test-nets in a simple, declarative manner. You can read more about Eureka in its repository.
Deploying with Eureka
First clone compound-eureka and follow installation instructions.
Let’s start by adding new definitions. Definitions tell Eureka what types of contracts exist, what properties they have, and how to deploy them. For example, the Uni contracts new CompLike delegate as such:
define('Erc20', {
  match: {
    type: 'uni',
    has_properties: ['address']
  },
  contract: 'Uni',
  properties: {
    address: 'address',
    block: {
      type: 'number',
      setter: async ({trx}, contract, block) => {}
    },
    name: 'string',
    decimals: 'number',
    symbol: 'string'
  },
  build: async ({existing}, contract, { address }) => {
    return existing(contract, address);
  }
});

define('CCompLikeDelegate', {
  contract: 'CCompLikeDelegate',
  build: async ({deploy}, contract, props) => deploy(contract)
});

Here we add two new definitions, one for Uni which simply uses and existing Uni build and a CCompLikeDelegate with a deploy function that takes no args.
Next, we’ll add new declarations to our Eureka files. These declarations describe what contracts we expect to have available after we apply the Eureka changes. We will add UNI, CCompLikeDelegate and cUNI declarations, such as:
// Main-net https://etherscan.io/token/0x1f9840a85d5af5bf1d1762f925bdaddc4201f984
Erc20#uni [uni] ! {
  type: ""uni""
  address: '0x1f9840a85d5aF5bf1D1762F925BDADdC4201F984'
  name: ""Uniswap""
  symbol: ""UNI""
  decimals: 18
}

}

Note: you may need to add oracle information (e.g. in oracle-simple.eureka).
Additionally, you could add another definition for Uni to deploy it from scratch (instead of using an existing version). Finally, you may want to saddle import the build for Uni, which will pull the source code, ABIs, etc from Etherscan and create a build file (like what would be produced by solc). You can run:
npx saddle import -n ropsten --outdir=.build --outname=uni.json 0x1f9840a85d5af5bf1d1762f925bdaddc4201f984

Next, you can apply the migration, which will deploy the contracts and create a Comp governance proposal on the given network to have your new cToken supported. If you have 100,000 test-net Comp (or you are developing locally any are not using the governance system), you can add the token to the supported tokens mapping to have a proposal or change created automatically:
Unitroller#comptroller [b73e68c] {
  // ...

  supported_markets: [
    //...
    #cUNI
  ]
}

Next, run the Eurkea migration, such as:
yarn eureka apply -n ropsten -b ./.build -c config/*.js -e eureka/{compound,testnet-gov,ropsten,4_ropsten,oracle-simple,admin-timelock}.eureka

This command will apply all of the declarations found in the given Eureka files. You can find common commands to run in README of the compound-eureka repository. If all goes well, you should have a new token, cToken, delegate and governance proposal (which you can vote for on https://app.compound.finance/vote if you switch to the correct network).
Deploying Manually
To deploy cUNI to mainnet, you can use saddle, a simple framework for building, testing and deploying Ethereum contracts. Saddle is already integrated into the compound-protocol repository. You may need to read the documents on adding keys (we suggest simply adding your private key in ~/.ethereum/<network> and using this key only as gas for deployment. Do not use this method for keys which have large sums of assets or special privileges.
Let’s first deploy our new CCompLikeDelegate contract:
npx saddle deploy -n mainnet CCompLikeDelegate

Next, we will deploy the CToken itself, referencing UNI and the CCompLikeDelegate. Note: many of these values can be found in the compound-config repo.

A Note on the Price Feed
For an asset to be supported by the protocol, they require a valid price feed. The Open Price Feed utilizes view contracts, which define the namespace of the asset, and map them to a price contributed by a reporter. The Coinbase Oracle has already added support for Uniswap (UNI); a view contract was deployed mapping the cUNI contract (deployed above) with the price of UNI in the Open Price Feed. You can view currently supported Open Price Feed prices at https://prices.compound.finance, a price feed aggregator.
Creating Governance Proposal
Once you have a token deployed, you’ll need to create a Governance Proposal to integrate your token into the system (e.g. to support a new asset market). You will need either 100,000 COMP delegated to you, a sponsor with 100,000 COMP delegates, or to create an Autonomous Proposal.
Spread the Word
The final step in the governance process is to let people know about your change. The Forums are a great resource for discussion, but you could also discuss on Twitter and in Discord.",68,2688.6,2020-09-23

First off, it is the unborrowed UNI tokens that are “locked” in the protocol that will be able to be voted (e.g. if User A supplies 100 UNI and User B borrows 50, then there are 50 UNI left in the cToken that can be voted. If User C borrows 50 more, then there would be 0 in the cToken for it to vote (but high interest rates would likely cause more UNI to re-enter the protocol)). As for voting, we hope / expect a community member to build a voting contract and delegate the UNI in this cToken to that new contract. That contract could be governed by Comp Governance, or any other system the community agrees on. I’m excited to see what people build.",46,14.2,2020-09-25
['Governance Guide — How To Propose'],"Anybody with  1%  of COMP delegated to their address can  propose  a governance proposal; proposals are simple or complex sets of actions, such as adding support for a new asset, changing an asset’s collateral factor, changing a market’s interest rate model, or changing any other parameter or variable of the protocol. This post is a visual, step-by-step guide on how create a governance proposal via Compound’s Voting Interface. If you’d like to jump ahead straight to the Voting Interface, you can jump ahead here. In addition, for a more technical understanding of what’s happening under the hood, please see our protocol Documentation.
Before we get started, let’s review the requirements to create a governance proposal as of today:

A web3 wallet
A delegation amount (votes) in excess of  1%  from a single wallet address

Important proposal information:

If your proposal involves calling a new contract address, that work should be previously completed, and audited before creating a proposal.
All proposals have a pending period. This acts as a period for votes to set delegations prior to a proposal becoming active, at which point, it can be voted on.
Only the creator of a proposal can cancel it. This can be canceled up until the execute function has been called on the passed proposal.
For a detailed view of the states of a proposal, view this diagram.

Step 1 – Navigate to the Compound Interface and Connect your Wallet

Go to https://app.compound.finance/vote

When you first visit the interface, a pop-up modal will ask you to connect your Web3 wallet. We recommend using MetaMask, the most popular browser-based Web3 wallet.

3172×2026 240 KB
Step 2 – Understanding the Compound Voting Interface

After connecting your wallet, you’ll see the main components of the interface: the  Voting Wallet  component on the left,  Proposals  on the right, and your  Vote Balance  on top.
The number of votes the connected wallet has is displayed in the center, large, on top of the dark background.
If you have over  1%  of total votes (100,000.00000001) you will see a  “Create Proposal” Button  that leads to a simple interface to create governance proposals. For the sake of this guide, we will be focusing on this part of the interface.

3172×2026 355 KB
Step 3 – Click “Create Proposal” to Start
Step 4 – Understand the Create Proposal Interface

The proposal creation page is broken down into two halves: the  Proposal Description  and associated  Actions.

Each proposal is required to have a  Title ,  Overview , and at least one  Action.

To add an Action, click the ‘+’ button in the green “add action” bar.
Once everything is filled out, the “Submit Proposal” button will become active and you can submit your proposal.
There are many contracts and functions to propose changes to, but for sake of this walk through, we’ll focus on a single type of proposal.

3172×2026 208 KB
Step 5 – Add an Action to the Proposal

You may  add multiple actions to any proposal , but for the sake of this guide, we’ll only be adding one.
Because  all proposals are executable code , the creation process is simply a selection of pre-defined dropdowns.
To start, click the ‘+’ button in the green “add action” bar on the right side of the screen.
The first part of adding an action to a proposal is selecting the targeted contract address for the action. You may select from the contracts used in the Compound Protocol or reference a new one. In this case, we’ll select the cETH contract.
Based on the chosen contract (cETH), we’ll now need to add a function we wish to change. In this case, we’ll select _setInterestRateModel.
Based on the chosen function, you may be required to enter additional inputs, in this case, to complete the proposal we need to provide a new interest rate model contract address.
Once all fields are completed, the “Add Action” button will become active (green) and you can add the action the the proposal.
You can edit all actions after adding them, but the current interface limits deleting an action. Simply refresh your page to clear the proposal and start fresh.

3172×2026 218 KB
3172×2026 259 KB
3172×2026 214 KB
Step 5 – Add a Title and Overview to your Proposal

After all actions are added, you’ll need to provide a  Title  and  Overview  to describe your proposal. The more clear and concise these inputs are, the better. This is a great place to link audits, blog posts with further analysis or details, etc.
In the Overview section you can use Markdown to stylize your content.
Once filled out, the “Submit Proposal” will become active and your proposal is ready to be submitted into the Compound Governance system!

"['Distribution of COMP token to early users, pre-COMP distribution period']","Hello community !
After 20% reward were removed to liquidity providers on compound.
In an attempt to reward less farmers, and more the usage.
I would like to hear about your feedback and to implement a reward for the early users of Compound protocol, pre comp distribution.
It would reward the usage, more than the farming, and reward these who sticked to bring their funds to the new protocol which was compound since 2018 for a 1% apy often when centralized platforms were offering much higher incentive in term of supply apy, more than the farmers who would go and leave to a new place when apy decrease.
I am not necessary for “cutting” the farmers further to the previous proposal which was taken, but for redirecting the 20% that was removed to them to pre comp distribution Users for a given period which could last one year.
We should find what is technically possible to bring a reward to early users, if these 20% are not currently accessible, we might find an other way ! listening to your ideas
By looking at other most used protocols, we can see they almost all rewarded their early users pre governance token distribution with a share of these.
Uniswap : Near 150 millions of uni supply went to pre uni community users,(close to total supply at launch), in a year, september 2021, there will be around 400 millions UNI, so thats almost like whole year of Uni distribution given at launch to early users, thus I wouldn’t find disproportionned to redirect the 20% that was taken of the Lps, rewarding more the farming, to the community, pre comp, rewarding the actual “usage”, and for a given period which could equal one year.
Uni has gotten a lot of credit for retroactive token distribution, and other protocols which made the mistake not to process like it are currently starting a retroactive correction (see RARI governance token)
Crv, and many other protocols also thought about their early users when releasing their token, that’s why I think Comp is also able and should think to reward proportionally their early adopters, pre comp distribution !
For those telling me noone will wanna do the “data search work” : we could use the same process as on proposal 022 : https://twitter.com/compoundfinance/status/1305239284547346432?s=20
and call withdraw from the csai reserves for 5k worth or what is needed as a bounty for the so called “paperwork” to reward the pre comp users community. We could thus afford to obtain all the necessary data for the fair pre comp reward calculations. (Which I cannot do myself as I am not a coder, but I’m sure we can do it, as most of other protocols succeeded, uniswap even went to reward their v1 protocol users !)
We could use some datas that reward users accruing of their volume or supplying/borrowing throught the years 2018-2019-2020 pre comp distribution, possibly proportional to the interest received/paid (same system as now),an idea would also be to proceed as uniswap and to weight higher the older the liquidity providers provided its liquidity, and I am sure we can find out what is the most fair and best technical way to do it!
Retroactive incentive has been proven to be a clear path to decentralization, and I think it’s the right moment to bring a correction in the way comp launch was organised and not to forget early adopters.
In my opinion, early network participants of compound should be treated as a gem who participated in the protocol, not for the reward (comp token did not exist and noone expected an airdrop) and every network participant should be a stakeholder.
Listening to your feedback and hoping we could implement that soon if the community agrees !
Thank you for your time",56,286.0,2020-09-18
"['Distribution of COMP token to early users, pre-COMP distribution period']","It’s nice to want things for free but I believe that the COMP token should be given out to it’s user and members who vote in a way and effort that reduces centralized governance with to much power at the top. If only early users get COMP, it will likely further consolidate governance between the few.
Those who were early had the benefit of picking up COMP early and at significant cost savings. It’s one things for everyone to earn COMP equally but to only distribute to a select few would be unfair to those who have purchased COMP as significantly higher prices in order to participate in governance. Uniswap, which is referenced, gave to everyone who used or tried their platform and to all current existing LP providers. They didn’t segregate any new from old, all were treated fairly.
I personally believe it may be best to apply a dividend to voter participation, assuming that we get the cost of voting reduced. Of course, a COMP payment for voting might be seen as an offset for the voting cost.",48,69.6,2020-09-21
"['Distribution of COMP token to early users, pre-COMP distribution period']","To answer your short message :
The current structure is really rewarding the future users, given the 4 year distribution horizon, but it does tell to the old users “thanks for providing early traction, which allowed VC money and kept us building throught the crypto winter, however we won’t ditribute you any comp”
I think you did not understand the UNI tokenomics by saying “they did not segregate any new from old”, Uni actually distributed at launch almost all the tokens to early users pre-uni distribution (400 per account), but also, the early liquidity providers were rewarded proportionally to the volume they provided, and with a higher weight given to older date, this was taking into account that for a given dollar at an older date, represent a higher % of the network, higher risks (newer protocol), and higher importance in the traction given to the protocol. They are even trying to reach and reward every user that didn’t use the protocole, but used a proxy interacting with the protocol : https://gov.uniswap.org/t/application-for-retroactive-proxy-contract-airdrop-for-projects-apps/3221strong text
I dislike this word, “segregate”, however if it means taking into account we all have a different historic with the protocole, allocated to it our funds differently throught 2018 2019 2020 and that this involvement should matter, then segregating makes sense. And again, noone is asking for a boost or a bonus over future users on the liquidity they are currently providing; just a correction on past emission.
You seem to think that rewarding early users would both : be bad for comp investors, be unfair for current network participants, would prevent from applying dividends to voter participation or further development in comp distribution.
Firstly you should get that getting COMP into the hands of dedicated early users who demonstrated strong interest in the protocol itself, rather than into the hands of whale farmers who don’t care about anything but yield, is great for comp and for comp investors. And I don’t agree that “it would be unfair for the investor” : these tokens are allocated to the community already. So it’s not reducing their holdings or inflating anything away.
Secondly, early users are not necessary asking for a better treatment  compared to post-comp distribution users, but at least a similar one, something fair. And I am not asking to cut your reward. Comp distribution to early users is currently 0.
Thirdly I disagree with you and think the idea you are mentionning is not incompatible at all with a reward distribution to early users of the protocol, it’s just an other proposition that can be examined and (maybe?) applied at the same time.
To come back to the technical aspects of distribution of COMP token to early users, I am thinking we could propose an approach which both benefits the users, and the capital, we could allocate a part of the reward toward the users, and a part toward the capital, the same way UNI did actually, uni was heavily weighting towards users. We will need later to come with fair and accurate ideas and propositions.
I would have hoped you would see more than “We want our free coins” in my message.
And by the way, would early network participants want their share of the pie, wouldn’t it be legitimate ?",44,38.8,2020-09-21
"['Distribution of COMP token to early users, pre-COMP distribution period']","We need to break down the reasoning behind these airdrops. From my point of view, they are:

A source for increasing decentralization
To help build an active community post decentralization

As much as I’d like to reward old users of Compound, I think we should focus on trying to accomplish these goals when distributing significant amounts of COMP. We as a community don’t gain from airdropping COMP to inactive users or accounts that will immediately sell.
We want to try to devise a method for distributing COMP that will stimulate the community as much as possible. Vesting the COMP, in my opinion, is a must for this.",41,118.2,2020-09-21
"['Distribution of COMP token to early users, pre-COMP distribution period']","I think you have at least one big mistake in your logic. There is indeed a benefit of airdropping to accounts who immediately sell. It’s decentralization, you give a portion of voting power directly to people who were part of what helped to make Compound what it is. It doesn’t matter really what they do with that. It’s their share, if they want to sell, it’s their choice. For every seller there’s a buyer on the other side. Or maybe you trully believe that it’s much better to give vast majority tokens to select few who own the most capital, so only they could sell (or get majority votes otherwise) as it pretty much happening now? 
It’s not that bad idea to retroactively drop something to old users, though how big that portion should be, is a place for discussion. And Compound is a very different system from Uniswap, Compound users are basically liqudity providers at same time. I don’t think such distribution could cover such a big amount of small users. So, while i don’t think it would be as efficient as uniswap distribution, i’m more for it, than against.
Now come to vesting idea. Vesting is good for VC and team who got big amounts of tokens “airdropped” to them. But in general, if by vesting you mean simple timelock in address i believe it’s not very good concept. It removes liquidity and chains capital, both of which aren’t really good for anything which supposed to grow and develop.
If , on the other hand, by vesting you mean locking COMP tokens inside supply pool or any other liquidity pool and rewarding users for doing so, than i fully support that idea.
But for that, we do need COMP market supported by Compound to begin with. And so far nobody with enough voting power is interested in proposing that. ",38,37.6,2020-09-22
['Adding Support for Gemini GUSD'],"Hi Compound community,
I recently submitted an application to onboard Gemini’s GUSD stablecoin as a collateral asset to the MakerDAO protocol, as well as an initial proposal to add support with Aave. I think that GUSD could also be a worthy addition to Compound.
Some details about GUSD:
GUSD is issued by Gemini Trust Company, LLC, a New York state based trust company. The fiat USD corresponding to issued GUSD is held by State Street Bank and Trust Company (NYSE:STT). Monthly accounting examinations are performed by BPM, LLP. GUSD was launched in September 2018 and for a time was one of the largest stablecoins with over $100M circulating at its peak. The circulating supply of GUSD has since declined as it was dwarfed by USDC, USDT and other stablecoins with wider trading and defi usage. The supply of GUSD is currently ~$10.5M, having grown from a trough of ~$4M at the end of 2019.
Whitepaper: https://gemini.com/static/dollar/gemini-dollar-whitepaper.pdf
Website: https://gemini.com/dollar
Twitter: https://twitter.com/Gemini
Source Code: https://github.com/gemini/dollar
GUSD token contract: https://etherscan.io/token/0x056fd409e1d7a124bd7017459dfea2f387b6d5cd
Accountant’s reports at bottom of page: https://gemini.com/dollar#reports
Trail of bits contract audit: https://gemini.com/static/dollar/gemini-dollar-trailofbits-audit.pdf
Liquidity:
GUSD can be exchanged for USD at a fixed 1:1 rate on the Gemini exchange. I have personally tested this out with good results: withdraw of GUSD from Gemini exchange was sent within 1 minute using fast gas, and deposit back into Gemini was credited within ~17 block confirmation. It should be possible for liquidators (who are willing/able to KYC) to flip GUSD collateral directly through Gemini for the time being. GUSD also has a few trading pairs on other centralized exchanges such as OKEx, HitBTC, and ZB. I plan on submitting a proposal to create a GUSD Curve pool in the near future as well, if this is supported by veCRV voters the on-chain liquidity for GUSD should improve substantially.
Benefits for Compound:

Diversification of centralized assets: GUSD relies on a different issuer and custodian compared to USDC, TUSD, USDT, or BUSD. Credit, custody, or regulatory risks may be less correlated across these assets, which could reduce risk to Compound.
New DeFi on/off ramp: Gemini has good linkage with US bank wire and ACH networks, comparable to Coinbase as a fiat ramp.

Coinbase has an outsize influence over Defi through its association with USDC and primacy in regulated crypto trading. I think Compound could benefit long term from more diversity in the regulated exchange and stablecoin space.

If you’d like to jump ahead straight to the Voting Interface, you can jump ahead here. In addition, for a more technical understanding of what’s happening under the hood, please see our protocol Documentation.
Before we get started, let’s review the requirements to vote as of today:

A web3 wallet
A COMP Balance and or a Delegated Vote Balance
Your votes must have been delegated to you prior to a proposal becoming active in order for your votes to count towards that proposal
An Active Proposal to vote on

Step 1 – Review The Proposal

Before voting, it’s vital to understand the proposal and what changes are being proposed. Review before you vote!
To review, you can see a list of all proposals here (note: this is mainnet view).
To review the specific proposal used in this guide, you can view that here (note: this is a ropsten proposal).
The Proposal Detail page shows the  Proposer ,  Functions Called , and a detailed, human-written overview of what should be happening.
Because the proposal has just become active, you’ll notice that there are still no votes. Over time, these vote panels will be filled in.

Step 4 – Voting On A Proposal

Reminder —> You can only vote once! So be sure on your action before you take it.
If you both see an Active Proposal and “For” and “Against” buttons on that proposal, you’re all set to cast your vote and influence the Compound Protocol.
To start, simply click on the voting action you want to choose. For the sake of this guide, we’ll be voting “For” this proposal.
After choosing a voting direction, you’'ll be presented with a modal asking you to confirm the transaction via web3 (or metamask in our case). This modal will show you how many votes you’re able to put towards this vote.
After confirming the transaction with via web3, you’ll see the modal update, providing you an Etherscan link to the transaction.
Once your transaction has been mined, you’ll see the confirmed state in the modal. You’ll also notice that the “For” and “Against” buttons have been replaced by the direction of your vote.

['Governance Guide — How To Delegate'],"The Compound Governance voting system works via delegation of votes, which is a built-in-feature of the COMP token. As a COMP token holder, you can delegate voting rights while keeping your COMP safe in your wallet, cold storage, wherever. This post is a step-by-step guide on how to delegate your votes and the options you have in doing so. This should act as a visual, intuitive guide to accessing Compound’s Voting Interface (if you have a COMP balance), and delegate your voting rights. If you’d like to jump ahead straight to the Voting Interface, you can jump ahead here. In addition, for a more technical understanding of what’s happening under the hood, please see our protocol Documentation.
Before we get started, let’s review the requirements to delegate as of today:

A web3 wallet
Having a COMP Balance

Important delegation information to know:

A wallet that holds COMP, but is undelegated cannot vote. Even if you’re planning to vote yourself, you still need to manually delegate or “self-delegate” to make those votes count.
If Alice has 10 COMP and delegates her votes to Bob, Bob now has 10 votes but cannot delegate those votes to Charles. You can only delegate votes if you hold the corresponding COMP for those votes.
If Alice is delegating to Bob and has 10 COMP in her wallet, Bob has 10 votes. If Charles sends Alice 10 more COMP, Alice now has 20 COMP and her delegation to Bob is automatically updated to 20 votes. No re-delegation needed if balances change.

Step 1 – Navigate to the Compound Interface and Connect your Wallet

Go to https://app.compound.finance/vote

When you first visit the interface, a pop-up modal will ask you to connect your Web3 wallet. We recommend using MetaMask, the most popular browser-based Web3 wallet.

3172×2026 240 KB
Step 2 – Understanding the Compound Voting Interface

After connecting your wallet, you’ll see the main components of the interface: the  Voting Wallet  component on the left,  Proposals  on the right, and your  Vote Balance  on top.
The number of votes the connected wallet has is displayed in the center, large, on top of the dark background.
If Delegating, the Voting Wallet shows  Votes Received ,  Votes Delegated , and the address that you’re  Delegating To.

If Undelegated, the Voting Wallet shows  Votes Received ,  COMP Balance , and that you’re Undelegated. For the purposes of this guide, we’ll be focusing on this next.

3172×2026 329 KB
Step 3 – Understanding Delegation Types

To delegate, click the “Delegate” button in the Voting Wallet.
To begin, you’ll need to choose from one of the two delegation types:  Manual Voting  or  Delegate Voting .

Manual Voting  is what you want to choose if you’re going to vote on your own behalf.

Delegate Voting  is what you want to choose if you want someone else to vote on your behalf. A good example of this would be an individual delegating to another protocol they liked to use, and believed in their same mission.
Unlike casting a vote, in the Compound Governance system you can change your delegation at any time.

3172×2026 301 KB
Step 4A – Selecting Delegation: Manual Voting

To setup Manual Voting from an undelegated wallet, first click the big green “Delegate” button to open up the  Choose Delegation  modal.
For this part of the guide, we’re going to go through the  Manual Voting  flow.
After selecting Manual Voting, all that’s left is to confirm the transaction with Metmask and wait for the transaction to be mined. Select “confirm” in Metamask and you’ll be presented with a link to etherscan to view the transaction.
Once the ‘pending’ state has resolved on the Voting Wallet component, you’ll see the updated delegation address. In the case of the below screenshots, for Manual Voting, after the transaction is mined, you will see your Votes Received and Votes Delegated now become 100.

3172×2026 327 KB
3172×2026 333 KB
Step 4B – Selecting Delegation: Delegate Voting

To setup  Delegate Voting  from an undelegated wallet, first click the big green “Delegate” button to open up the  Choose Delegation  modal. Though for this example, we’ll assume we’re going from  Manual Voting  to  Delegate Voting , which, is exactly the same flow.
For this part of the guide, we’re going to go through the  Delegate Voting  flow.
After selecting Delegate Voting, you’ll now need to provide an Ethereum address of whom you wish to delegate your votes to. If you know the address, paste it in and continue. If you need some inspiration, head on over to our Governance Leaderboard to see the top delegate and who they are.
Once you’ve entered a proper 0x address, you’ll see a green light indicator verifying the format and character account of the address. When both verified and you’re ready, select “Delegate Votes” to create the transaction.
You’ll now see a modal displaying the number of votes being delegated, and waiting for you to confirm the transaction (via signing an Ethereum transaction). Select “confirm” in Metamask and you’ll be presented with a link to etherscan to view the transaction.
Once the ‘pending’ state has resolved on the Voting Wallet component, you’ll see the updated delegation address. In this case, for Delegate Voting, you’ll see that you now have 0 votes, but that your delegated votes now match your COMP balance of 100.
Fun fact, over time, you’ll be able to track the address you’re delegating to in terms of their votes casted on previous proposals. If your delegate isn’t voting, delegate to someone else! You’ll be able to view this Voting History in the delegate profile pages found in the Compound Governance Explorer.

['Governance Proposal 22: Borrow Limits Comptroller Patch (Renamed to Borrow Caps)'],"I plan to deploy the current version of the new Comptroller with borrow limits implemented over the weekend. View the PR here. Assuming the deployment goes as planned and matches successfully, the proposal will be made sometime next week.
Update: Deployed here.
This was a somewhat long process with multiple postings about it:




Borrow Limits for each Market Comptroller patch Protocol Development


    With the addition of WBTC collateral, many people have been talking about putting up more safeguards to avoid total loss in an infimint situation. While without migrating WBTC to a new cToken, I don’t think a supply cap is possible, but blck and I thought it’d be beneficial if we implement borrow limits for each cToken to reduce potential losses. 
For example, ETH is rarely borrowed, so why should it be possible to borrow the whole supply when the only possible situation for that happening will …
  






Borrow Limits Rules Governance Process


    With the Borrow Limits patch code completed, it is now time to decide on a set of rules that the community board will follow when setting the borrow limits. If approved by the governance process, this board will control a multisig that will act as the Borrow Limits Guardian. The community board will consist of 6 addresses with 4 required consensus: two controlled by members of the compound team and 4 by the community. 
This set of rules dictates how the community board sets market borrow limits.…
  






Community Multisig (4-of-6) Deployment Governance Process


    This post references this Discord message posted in the #governance channel of the Compound Protocol Discord, and refers to Discord usernames from that channel. 

In a community-driven effort with stewardship from @arr00, a Community Multisig has been deployed that can, through the governance process, be voted into usage by the protocol for a variety of purposes: for example, to act as Pause Guardian ; or in the future, to act as Borrow Limit Guardian . 
Six community members have been proposed …
  


Following the requests of the community, initially, the new code will be introduced without actually being utilized. The newly made community multisig will be set as the “Borrow Limit Guardian” but will not impose any limits. In future proposals, the limits will be set and the role of the community multisig will be further established.
I have written a test suite and a fork simulating the new proposal to test the new code, and it all checks out. Additionally, the new patch has been the comptroller on Koran for the past few weeks. Please proof read the code yourself before voting on the proposal. The code does not touch any core features of the protocol, so it not been audited professionally.
Another new idea I would like to introduce in this proposal is rewards to users who build on the protocol to encourage further development. In the future, this could be automated by the Governance Alpha contract, but for now, this must be added as additional actions to the proposal. Following recommendations, I propose withdrawing $5000 from the SAI reserves (equivalent to 2360 SAI) to my address as a reward for bringing this feature to reality. I don’t have any precedent to base this number on, so if you think it should be different, say so!
All in all, the planned actions of the proposal are as follows:

Unitroller _setPendingImplementation(NewComptroller)
NewComptroller _become(Unitroller)
Unitroller _setBorrowLimitGuardian(community multisig)
cSAI reduceReserves(2360 * 1e18)

I propose setting cUSDC interest rate model to a new LegacyJumpRateModelV2 deployed with the same parameters as the current DAI and USDT interest rate models: base rate of 0%, 4% at kink, kink at 80% utilization, and 25% at 100% utilization.

Subsidizing gas fees for new contract deployments. These deployment fees have really gone up and I can imagine smaller users sometimes being reluctant to spend $200 ETH to deploy a new contract.
I am almost done building up a rest api that will accept delegate and vote sigs and batch relay them (made very easy thanks to Adam B). If the community gas fund could pay for the gas here, all users would be able to participate in governance for free. I strongly believe that voting should be free for the end users.

['Community Gas Fund'],"New contract deployments sounds like rational usage. but I would strongly suggest AGAINST subsidy for user-voting.  AS it will encourage people with like 0,05 COMP to vote. Cause it’s free, isn’t? Well it’s not actually free, somebody actually pay for those “free” transactions and that money could be spend on something ACTUALLY useful for protocol. We better donate to Red Cross or WWF which is better spending of that money than paying fees to miners for transaction which doesn’t even matter if it actually exist or not, as it’s not deciding anything.
And you can’t really expect people to act responsibly on money which isn’t from their pocket. I’d say don’t do that, if some 0,1 COMP minority want to spend their own money to do a vote instead of spending that same money to buy another 0,1 COMP instead they could very well do that. But reserves shouldn’t be wasted in such irresponsible way.
I support your good intentions, but i rather have some simple voting-UI implemented, which just look at user wallet and calculate their votes, rather than using on-chain transaction for every possible voting and putting subsidy on top of it.
At same time it’s possible vector of attack, somebody could split 0,01 COMP amond 1000 addresses, cast a vote from all of them and burn a hole lot of “community fund”. And while it doesn’t look great thing to do, there is always somebody out there who will do, just because they can.",35,47.0,2020-09-01
['Community Gas Fund'],"I believe that using SAI reserves would be a semi temporary solution; however, it will go a long way. We could take around 20k more SAI out of the reserves and be fine which is about $50k worth of ETH.

The easiest way to attain this is to redeem the sai reserves for eth, and spend half of it on CHI.

Snapshot is a cool tool. Off chain voting based on token balance snapshots. Simple web UI for proposals and voting, multiple choice votes, shows results of vote so far.

Taking snapshot based on the creation time of the proposal can be used for identifying voting participants.
we don’t need to spend fund to support gas fee for voting activity

['Adding support for CACHE Gold (CGT)'],"CACHE Gold Summary
CACHE Gold tokens are fully regulated, public, transparent, redeemable tokens backed by gold stored in vaults around the world. Each token is backed by one gram of pure, investment grade gold. CACHE Gold is different from other gold backed tokens in several key ways:


Superior transparency:  Through the CACHE Gold Explorer , CACHE provides real-time tracking data on all the bars backing CACHE Gold. Tracking data includes location, photograph, serial number, weight, purity, refiner, current valuation and more. Tracking data is provided directly by the vaults that store the gold (Brink’s, Loomis, Dillon Gage IDS and The Safe House).

Superior redemption options:  CACHE Gold provides multiple redemption options in multiple regions: vault pickup, shipping, or sale for USD. CACHE also provides significantly smaller 100 gram ($6,250) and 1 kilogram ($62,500) bars than the 400 toz LBMA good delivery bars (~$750,000+) that competing tokens offer for redemption.

Decentralized:  Unlike competing tokens, CACHE limits its role to exchanging physical gold for tokens and vice versa. Liquidity, vaulting and exchange are left to reputable industry leading firms. This provides a number of benefits such as eliminating a single point of failure and creating a competitive market place for token holders to sell or ship their redeemed gold. CACHE is designed such that any reputable industry firm (vaults, dealers, retailers, distributors, logistics companies, exchanges, etc.) can participate in and profit from the CACHE Gold ecosystem.

Flexibility:  CACHE Gold is backed by pure grams of gold and its asset tracking system GramChain can support any type of gold, regardless of weight or purity, as long as it meets industry standards for investment grade gold. CACHE Gold is currently backed exclusively by 100 gram and 1 kilogram bars, but this may change over time as market demand dictates.

Industry experience:  Unlike other gold backed tokens, CACHE Gold was founded, designed and developed by precious metals and vaulting industry veterans.

Publicly auditable:  A token audit takes about 1 minute to perform for anyone with access to a web browser:

Step 1.  Get the number of CACHE Locked gold grams from the CACHE Explorer:  34,301.57  (as of 05-09-2020 ~10:51 UTC)
Step 2.  Get the number of unbacked tokens that are locked in the CACHE Unbacked Treasury:  0.0
Step 3.  Get the total number of CACHE Gold Tokens (“Total Supply” on Etherscan) ever minted:  34,301.57
Step 4 . Calculate CACHE Gold tokens in circulation:
Total Supply ( 34,301.57 ) - CACHE Unbacked Treasury ( 0.0 ) =  34,301.57
Step 5 . Determine if the tokens in circulation are greater than or equal to CACHE Locked gold grams? If so CACHE has passed its token audit. In this case:
34,301.57  CACHE Gold in Circulation <=  34,301.57  Toal CACHE Gold minted (“Total Supply”)
Compare this to the results of a similar exercise on other gold backed tokens.
It would also be trivial for any independent third party to run an automated monitor to ensure full gold backing at all times because all of the relevant data is always public.
All vaults (Brink’s, Loomis, Dillon Gage IDS and The Safe House) that store gold backing CACHE Gold are also independently audited and insured.
Project History
CACHE Private Limited was incorporated in Singapore in August 2018 with the goal of designing and developing a regulated, transparent, freely tradable, fully redeemable gold token that can scale to millions of ounces (billions of dollars USD). CACHE Gold token launched on the Ethereum mainnet on February 21, 2020.
How are CACHE Gold tokens used?
Each CACHE Gold token is backed by one gram of pure investment grade gold. CACHE Gold is used to track the current spot price of gold and is redeemable on demand for physical gold bars or the equivalent value in USD. See this video for more details on what CACHE Gold is used for.
How is CACHE Gold licensed and regulated?
CACHE Private Limited was incorporated in Singapore and is [licensed and regulated by the Singapore Ministry of Law as a precious stones and precious metals dealer.
Where can you trade CACHE Gold?
CACHE Gold is currently traded on centralized (e.g. Bittrex Global) and decentralized (e.g. Uniswap) digital asset exchanges. Redemption orders can be submitted on CACHE’s website 24/7.
Does CACHE Gold have a legal opinion?
Yes we have. CACHE Gold is not a security, financial instrument or digital payment token, it is an asset backed token.
Can CACHE Gold freeze/blacklist addresses or confiscate tokens?
No, this functionality is  not  part of CACHE Gold’s smart contracts.
Oracle / Data Sources:
The CACHE Explorer provides real-time data for the gold bars backing CACHE Gold. All tracking data is hashed and broadcasted to the Ethereum blockchain to prevent data tampering, manipulation or deletion.
In terms of pricing data, any reliable and reputable oracle or feed for the spot price of gold is suitable. We can also provide our own.

It is a violation of the Bankruptcy Code for a creditor to take certain actions against a borrower while the borrower is insolvent or in bankruptcy.   For example, the Compound Finance contract’s automatic liquidation of a borrower’s account (if the borrow limit is exceeded, etc.), while a borrower is insolvent or in bankruptcy, could be such a violation.

"[""How will a borrower's bankruptcy be handled?""]","There’s no forced/automatic liquidation?  I was thinking of a situation like a forced sale of a home, where the homeowner files Chapter 13 just before the forced sale.  The bankruptcy forces an automatic stay on all collection activities, including forced sales.  If the bank tries to sell the home after a bankruptcy has been filed, it faces serious consequences such as fines, stripping the mortgage from the property, etc.  A Compound borrower who has supplied a significant amount of crypto assets as collateral, and who is on the brink of being liquidated because of surpassing the borrow limit, may become desperate enough to try a Chapter 13 bankruptcy strategy to prevent the liquidation.  I understand no one can stop a decentralized contract from  performing acts that are built into the contract.  However, the desperate borrower may try to come after people associated with Compound (programmers, founders, etc) and accuse them of violating the Bankruptcy Code’s automatic stay.",32,11.4,2020-08-31

True, the team can’t do anything about the liquidation.  That’s why I’m bringing this up, because it’s not likely the bankruptcy trustee will be satisfied with the excuse “it’s a decentralized app, and there was no way to stop the liquidation.”   What the bankruptcy court might do is order someone from Compound to give the assets back to the borrower, even if that means money comes out of the Compound team’s pockets.",27,5.4,2020-09-01

I would look at borrowing from Compound as similar to borrowing from your stockbroker on margin. As far as I know, filing bankruptcy does not prevent brokers from liquidating your stock collateral to repay your margin debt.

['Financially Incentivizing voting/voting delegation'],"Hi All,
I believe it is a good idea to financially incentivize voting/voting delegation with COMP token or DAI.
Reasons:

Decreasing voter apathy and increasing voter turn-out/voting power delegation.



1.a).  Help cover the gas fee incurred in voting/voting delegation.


1.b). Give more value back to supporters who at least bother to delegate his/her voting power.


1.c). Personal experience: I am a small comp holder, I don’t vote/delegate my votes as i was discouraged by the gas cost.



(Because of 1) Making quorum easier to reach, and making it possible to increase the voting quorum in the future.


In a separate idea post,  @lay2000lbs proposed that proposal threshold should be lowered.   (LINK HERE)  I replied in that post that (MY REPLY) we can have a tiered system, the lower COMP one holds in making a proposal, the higher the quorum is needed for that proposal to pass.

1.c). Personal experience: I am a small comp holder, I don’t vote/delegate my votes as i was discouraged by the gas cost.


I have made a community for small comp holders (it actually doesn’t matter if you are small comp holder) and it works as so: you delegate to me, and you get invited to a discord, which every proposal there is a little poll that you react thumbs up or thumbs down, and that controls however many votes I have, so if the votes on my discord is 5-5 and you have delegated 0.000001comp, you can still change the sides my 5k votes go to. even if you are delegating 10000comp or 0.0001 comp, you can still change the direction of 5k votes. DM me on discord (TennisBowling#7174, yellow name in compound discord) to know more
Now as for my views on this…
I believe that the required votes to make a proposal should be 10k, and maybe the comp emissions that have been reduced could be swapped to eth via paraswap or uniswap, and cover the gas cost of maybe everyone that votes and has under 100 comp (above are the big rich bois anyways). maybe 100 is too high, because we can’t repay everyone’s gas fees.

['Compound Proposal 022: Systematically Reduce Emission Quantity'],"Background
As discussed in @monet-supply’s post Adjusting COMP distributed model, it is clear that there is quite a bit of optimization that can be done to the COMP distribution model. We (Gauntlet) believe that the network should begin to increase the incentive for long-term holding of COMP relative to short-term holding and trading by yield farmers. While the introduction of COMP led to the ‘agricultural revolution’ and the usage of liquidity mining as a growth tool, it has become clear from on-chain and off-chain data that holding times, voter participation, and ‘real’ borrowing activity can be improved by distribution tweaks.
By distributing COMP to borrowers, the protocol encourages recursive leverage, which both brings little value and reduces security of the protocol. Based on the survey in that post, it is clear that at the very least, the COMP emission system needs to three control mechanisms:

Adjusting COMP emission rate
Scalar multiplier to allow for more uneven distribution between borrowers and suppliers
Time-locking mechanism

Proposal CP011 demonstrated that a reduction in the emission rate (e.g. via a call to _setCompRate) can be a useful tool for alleviating both sell pressure on COMP and as a way to encourage long-term COMP holdings.
However, as DeFi has become increasingly interconnected via farming and COMP has been utilized as a farming asset in a number of protocols (e.g. YAM), we believe that these changes should be made in a cautious, security-forward, and incremental manner. For instance, if the COMP emission was reduced 90% and subsequently, a large yield farming incentive led to COMP holders putting large fractions of the supply in a third-party contract, then we can expect both a supply-side crisis and an increase in recursive leverage.
To handle the fact that any change to the COMP distribution will ripple through the ecosystem, we propose a making changes via series of proposals. Each proposal will make an incremental update to the protocol which will be monitored for two weeks before the next incremental state is taken. This way, we can observe the market reaction (both in asset price, volatility, and usage in farming) and use the three control mechanisms to adjust the protocol. This will allow us to utilize an online learning approach to quantitatively choose the parameters for each of these incremental adjustments.
The sequence of incremental proposals that we will use is the following:

Reduce emissions rate (no technical risk, yields estimates of market demand for COMP)
Adjust the distribution to suppliers and lenders (minimal technical risk)
Add in a vesting period / time-lock (larger technical risk, would be the proposal with the largest risk so far)

Parameter Selection and Justification
We have constructed a Monte Carlo model (partially described in a working paper for optimizing emissions that can be found here) that shows that the current market demand for COMP in both centralized and decentralized exchange implies that COMP is being overproduced by 35-40%. However, this can also be illustrated more simply via some descriptive statistics and illustrations. Using tagged exchange addresses provided by Flipside’s Will Price, we looked at the both the distributions of holding times — how long an address held COMP issued via the comptroller before they sent it to a tagged exchange address (CEX and DEX) — as well as the amount of COMP that was held over time.
First, lets look at what fraction of COMP wealth was kept by addresses that didn’t sell all of their holdings (e.g. amount farmed - amount sent to exchanges > 0)

This distribution is unimodal [0] with a median of roughly 56%, implying that 50% of COMP holders kept 44% of their COMP earnings (e.g. used in farming, hodl’d). However, include COMP farmers who sold all COMP they earned we have a much more skewed distribution:

This is strong evidence that large fraction of COMP holders are selling all of their earning and not staying long-term holders. This data shows that roughly 17.2% of COMP issued is completely sold on exchanges and not held by long-term holders.
If we look at the length of time that COMP farmers hold COMP on their balance sheet, we find that most short-sighted COMP farmers sold their assets via DEXs such as Uniswap and Balancer:

(Note that the x-axis is the base-10 logarithm of the holding time)
Given these descriptive statistics and combined with some cursory simulation results, we believe that emissions should be reduced by 20%. Currently, emissions are 0.44 COMP / block and we believe that it should be lowered to 0.352 COMP/block. Once this change is made, Gauntlet will observe the changes to on-chain behavior and market data to estimate whether further reductions are needed.
Proposal Description
We will call _setCompRate on the uint input 0.176e18 to execute this reduction.
Post-Proposal Analysis
If the proposal passes, we will monitor the following data sources for changes after the proposal is executed:

COMP trading volumes, order book liquidity, DEX liquidity
Usage of COMP in other farming protocols (e.g. YAM, YFI, etc.)
Changes to borrower / supplier statistics (e.g. avg. loan size, avg. borrow)

We will combine these with our simulation model to estimate how much excess supply and/or demand there is in the market post-change and use this to guide our next emission-related proposal.

 tarun:

We (Gauntlet) believe that the network should begin to increase the incentive for long-term holding of COMP relative to short-term holding and trading by yield farmers.


To achieve the stated goal, I wish to present 3 alternative proposals:
a). Put a vesting period of x month on $COMP (similar to $SNX rewards’ 12 month vesting).
b). Put a vesting period on $COMP AND increase current period emission, which is to be balanced out by lower/decreased future period emission.
c). Put a x-month vesting period on $COMP on y% of token farmed, and the rest of the $COMP are immediately transferable.
I believe my alternative proposals can:
1). decrease market selling pressure.
2). Change the return estimation for $COMP farmers (e.g. bring discount factor into the equation), discouraging $COMP farmers whose only objective is selling $COMP on the open market.
and specifically for b).
3). Incentivizing long-term $COMP supporter/holders by increase their current period $COMP yield (bring discount factor into the equation. More yield now and less yield in the future is better than having the same yield in all periods).
Edit:
Also, it is worth considering the potential downsides of our proposals:
i). Potentially decreasing the stablescoins and tokens supplied in Compound ecosystem.
ii). Potentially decreasing the sell side liquidity of $COMP on both CEX and DEX.",88,92.4,2020-08-24
['Compound Proposal 022: Systematically Reduce Emission Quantity'],"Thank for your the feedback! We note that the third control mechanism (which we termed ‘time-locking’) is equivalent to individual cToken vesting. Currently, the current cToken design does not have a mechanism for vesting. The main complications with adding vesting is purely technical implementation — it would cover a lot of surface area and making sure that we have a minimal surface area implementation that doesn’t significantly increase gas costs for users will take a bit of time. We’ve been working on an implementation of this and once we have this tested and audited, we will submit a proposal to add in vesting functionality.
We think option b) is actually the most palatable in the long-run for all stakeholders, but requires vesting to be audited and implemented.
Regarding your latter two points about downsides: Order book signals and analytics suggest that there sufficient COMP liquidity, especially compared to other DeFi assets, as it has the most professional market makers trading it (thanks to the Coinbase listing). Only option c) would have a direct impact on market makers’ ability to tightly quote $COMP, at least based on simulations and backtests.",79,35.6,2020-08-24
['Compound Proposal 022: Systematically Reduce Emission Quantity'],"I feel this is misguided - it seems to be in response to the fact that the price of COMP is under-performing competing protocols because farmers are selling it.
COMP’s value is entirely determined by the discounted value of future cash flows that go to COMP holders.  The best way to increase COMP’s value is to credibly show that value will come to those holders.  This comes from increasing TVL and fees given to protocol owners.
This proposal wants to decrease the amount of COMP distributed for the very simple reason that it means that people won’t be able to sell as much.  This is merely attacking a symptom and not the actual problem.  Furthermore, this slows the progressive decentralization of the Compound protocol, when there is a clear trend of liquidity providers preferring to use platforms where they share in more of the economics and have more influence on the protocol’s future.
A long-term COMP investor should be happy that farmers are indiscriminately selling COMP today, depressing the price, and granting investors who believe the protocol will generate significant value in the future a better entry price.  In fact, this creates a better, more fair distribution, as miners are not hoarding their COMP tokens and consolidating control over the network.",78,35.4,2020-08-24
['Compound Proposal 022: Systematically Reduce Emission Quantity'],"I agree with @oooh_fa that extending the decentralization process of Compound is far from ideal.
What I’d be more interested in seeing is vesting and alternative methods of COMP distributions. Some that come to mind are: incentives for voting or staking COMP in voting contracts, rewarding community members who submit successful proposals, and maybe tipping in discord. An additional advantage of these other distribution routes is that the COMP will be given to users who understand and value its use as a governance token.",72,89.2,2020-08-24
['Compound Proposal 022: Systematically Reduce Emission Quantity'],"We certainly agree, but until we have a good generic method for adding vesting and lock-ups for issued COMP, we believe the network will bleed COMP and the majority of it will end up held by centralized market makers and exchanges. Given that COMP, unlike other liquidity mined assets, doesn’t incentivize on-chain pools (e.g. akin to Synthetix’s rewards contract), it also appears that a lot of the centralized exchange volume is held by market makers and exchanges rather than by new participants. Our first priority is making proposals is increasing the number of long-term active governance participants.
We have been working on code for vesting COMP rewards to cToken and have the following sequence of proposals in mind:

Add vesting (4-6 weeks): This is a large change and we want to get it audited and do a testnet trial for the community to analyze
Add pay-to-address (1-2 weeks): Allows the protocol to pay individual community members for successful proposals in a governance-transparent manner
Adding payments to governance participants (2-3 weeks): This will utilize the vesting code

Once vesting is in-place, we believe that emissions should probably be higher as @odette has suggested and we will provide numerical evidence for how to choose how much higher it should be. We think that @oooh_fa’s point is true for COMP in a world where COMP is on the same footing as the other liquidity mined tokens. However, as COMP has much more exposure to centralized exchanges and market makers, it is becoming increasingly clear that tokens incentivizing on-chain liquidity are doing a better job of distributing their tokens to a large number of people. We believe that once vesting is in-place, the Compound protocol can similarly incentivize on-chain liquidity in a manner that yields more long-term governance participation.",70,18.8,2020-08-24
['Compound Proposal 022: Systematically Reduce Emission Quantity'],"It sounds like there’s agreement that adding a vesting period is preferred vs. reducing per-block COMP distribution.
I would argue that there is not a pressing / urgent need to reduce COMP distribution, and so I would encourage Gauntlet to skip this unnecessary intermediate step and focus on the long-term step of introducing a vesting period.",68,88.4,2020-08-24
['Compound Proposal 022: Systematically Reduce Emission Quantity'],"I’m not sure if the goal of reducing farming and recursive leverage is in the best interest of COMP holders. I think these are the current effects of farming:

Massively inflated TVL
Great supply APY on DAI due to high utilization
Reserves filling at increased rates

The key driver behind all this (and the entire farming craze) is that we’re dealing with an irrational market. The key driver of the current market price is hype/good news and a limited supply. Reducing emission would reduce selling pressure by rational actors (as intended by this proposal) and therefore an increased price. The increased price will raise the farming APY, thereby possibly negating the effect of the reduced emission.
I think those who hold COMP because they farmed it or paid for it have no interest in stopping farming as that is what makes Compound look more valuable with high TVL. Vesting COMP could get rid of farming, massively dropping TVL, causing the hype to falter, causing a large drop in COMP price.
As a side-note, I doubt the ‘open’ community feels the voting rights are useful considering all the real voting power is in the hands of a select group of early partners, etc. At the current rate it will be years before there is enough COMP out there to speak of community. So at the moment COMP is just another speculative asset with no current intrinsic value. So price and price expectation are the main motivators in the market.",65,42.8,2020-08-25

Some concrete examples:

Setting aside x% of remaining COMP for a bug bounty program that will focus on the long-term sustainability of compound protocol
Incentivize integration of compound to smart contract wallets or even financial institutions (i.e. CeFi actors)

However, I acknowledge that such proposals might be contentious for the community if not done carefully1",60,31.8,2020-08-26
['Compound Proposal 022: Systematically Reduce Emission Quantity'],"Yes, I probably should have been more clear about this. Our goals with the reduction are really two fold:

To allocate a portion of the COMP emissions for usage in the protocol later (e.g. bug bounties, audits, payment to developers)
To incentivize long-term holding of COMP

In order for the former to be viable, we need to add in vesting (see: Vesting for the Compound protocol). However, we believe that lower emissions now and then adding vesting is the correct ordering for the following reasons:

Builds a larger reserve for bug bounties, contribution/security, incentivized voting participation, and to protocols that build on top of Compound
Will lead to a lessened concentration of COMP on centralized exchanges and increased holding times, especially as farming adds perverse incentives for long-term holders

I’m pretty unconvinced on the proposal to reduce COMP emissions. If the goal is “building up a reserve of COMP that can be used for paying for other community needs” it seems like it’s a very roundabout way to get to it. Why not just create a proposal to re-allocate a portion of undistributed COMP? Or why not use the COMP already allocated to that purpose? Thinking of “775,000 COMP are reserved for the community to advance governance through other means — which will be announced at a future date”
The secondary goal is to stop people from farming + dumping COMP – I’m all for that but don’t see how reducing emissions will help with that.
Finally, we’ve already reduced emissions since COMP launched. Reducing again seems to actually be going against the current evidence in the market that faster emission rates lead to both broader and deeper governance participation.",54,40.6,2020-08-26

@tarun  With COMP emissions, you are trying to privatize system’s shares to users. A similar system of giving shares to workers happened back when Soviet Union collapsed and privatized government owned factories to workers who promptly sold it for a dinner and a bottle of vodka to a few folks hoarding them who are now known as oligarchs.
With COMP a basic question remains - why would anyone keep COMP ? Answer this and you will solve your problem.
As I see it now, the current answer is to govern the protocol by an elite few and the majority is on for a ride, for whom it wont matter anyway as we cannot get enough of it to voice our point of view.
And this emission reduction is a prime example of that. Someone with a lot more shares will do as they please, always, imposing their will on the majority ( With all due respect to the Monte Carlo simulation from above).

['Compound Proposal 022: Systematically Reduce Emission Quantity'],"At first i’m largerly unconvinced that Community opinion actually matters, as Compound Governance is just pretend to be decentralised, while in reality it’s heavily centralised with like 20-30 entities can pass (or block any decision). So only their opinion actually do any difference and everything else can be just discarded as irrelevant noise. It’s worth noting, that pretty much none of controlling entities actually got their voting power from “user distribution”.
The argument that it’s in transition of transferring governance to users, while theoretically good quite contradicts with current proposal. Initial distribution time of COMP tokens is about 4 years to fully distribute. Which is a VERY LONG time for crypto.  And yet, less than 2 month from start here is talking that it is too fast. So, here we come to point
1 : If COMP distribution a process of transferring Compound protocol to decentralised governance than we should abstract from current price valuation, which is just temporary noise. In that perspective, decreasing emission is just a way to preserve current status-quo, delay transition to community governance and hold voting power by initial voters, who probably should vote yes. (and i encourage community to pay close attention who will vote yes to that)


Proposal title suggest decreasing emission by 20%, while proposal itself suggest to decrease from current 0.44 COMP/block to 0.176 COMP/block, which is more like 60%, isnt it? How to understand that?


I want to remind everybody, that current price valuation of COMP is fueled by yeild farming hype and big bubble. It’s hardly real and hardly sustainable long term, regardless of what would be done with emission. At the same time COMP and Compound itself is one of the few actual products with long-standing and proven value , sitting at the core of it. Extreme care should be taken, as any radical change can be the pin which blow that bubble.


I don’t really getting argument about centralised exchanges having big portion of COMP. Centralised exchanges are not the owners, but custodians of the COMP, which is likely in hands of many small owners, who (for reason of point 1) can basically benefit from COMP holding only by price speculation, as votes of single-double-triple digit COMP owners are largely irrelevant in decision making process (and holding COMP isn’t incentivesed in any other way either) , not even talking about those who have less than 1 COMP. Besides, do we know that holdings of centralised exchanges are from COMP distribution and not from initial seeded Uniswap liquidity leaked to that exchanges overtime?


To resume, i don’t really see what decreasing emission is trying to acihieve aside of delay of decentralisation process. Maybe attempt of price manipulation? Or attempt of blowing down all that house of cards defi constructed around Compound’s idea of distribution of governce token to users.
However, all of that being said, there is definitely some logic behind saying that might be there should be some improvement in distribution model.",48,59.4,2020-08-27
['Compound Proposal 022: Systematically Reduce Emission Quantity'],"Nice write-up and insights.
I don’t fully understand what the connection is between reducing emissions and increasing long-term hodling. I get that there will be funds for other things, but I don’t think the items mentioned will necessarily help.
One of the biggest reasons there are few long-term holders of COMP is because the (perceived) value of governance today is much less than the market value of the token. Why would I keep COMP knowing that governance is heavily centralized and my vote won’t count? Look at projects like yEarn, etc. No one is selling FYI (quite the opposite) because the expected value of governance (and potentially future cash flows) is much higher than today’s market price.
IMO increasing emissions + vesting would have been a much better solution. This way only people willing to lock up their rewards long term would provide liquidity.
Another way to increase long term hodling is giving COMP utility. Yam.finance showed, unsurprisingly, that when the token is useful for something, farmers/traders will want to own it. Enabling COMP as collateral like CREAM does or partnering with other protocols to support COMP in their projects are two of the many ways this could be accomplished.",47,24.2,2020-08-27
['Compound Proposal 022: Systematically Reduce Emission Quantity'],"As a new participant in this ecosystem, it is surprising to see that there are quite a few thoughtful responses and counter arguments to the proposal that are left completely unanswered. And governance poll is already setup without first attempting to at least provide more clarification to these counter arguments.
As many others have asked, I would also be curious to understand why is it considered a problem that most of the earned COMP is sold immediately?
One of the points of COMP distribution, as I understand, is to increase awareness of the platform and increase its user base, integrations and overall usage. Even though most of the new lenders are joining to “wash borrow” to maximize their yield, they are still becoming familiar with the platform and building a relationship with it. They will most likely remain as lenders even in future, as long as over time there will be natural demand for borrowing. (hopefully everyone understands that APRs of >40-50% can’t be sustainable)
The fact that most of the COMP is sold right away seems an extra positive too, because this is potentially bringing other new users too, who believe in compounds future and want to own piece of it without becoming liquidity providers right now.
Of course most important part is to continue to build things that will increase actual borrowing demand, but changing COMP distribution either way wont make a difference for it. COMP distribution is already set over a long enough time period. If actual borrow demand doesn’t increase to much higher levels in next 2-4 years, slower COMP distribution wont really change much.",48,14.6,2020-08-27
['Dividend on COMP'],"Hello.
I am new to compound and this forum. Forgive any ignorance on my behalf.
I was wondering if its already proposed to give some % dividend on comp token now or in the future for compholders?
Either to let them generate income or to encourage people to hold on to them.
At the current rate some people seem to dump any tokens earned really fast on the market which lead to a downward spiral in price. Especcially if there is little incentive to buy tokens.
Maybe it is in the best interest of the compound protocol to depreciate the token in value?
But if the token should bring other value besides governance a dividend would at least be beneficial to the intrinsic value of a comp token.
Some thing like staking or baking or pos mining would also be a form of dividend.
Please if possible share any thoughts on this.
Thanks Tim",75,590.0,2020-07-22
['Dividend on COMP'],"The idea has been thrown around before, but there hasn’t been any serious talk around it. Raising the price of COMP has never been a goal of the Compound team or community: its high price has caused issues with farming and required some actions to be taken to decrease risk.
Now that governance is being distributed more though, I could see a majority wanting to make financial gains from COMP as that is what most in DeFi are looking for.",75,90.0,2020-07-23

thanks a lot for this reply. It helped explain alot.
I understand the distribution among the community needs to be done first. It could be the safer route in case of scc and such regulations. But at this moment the distribution is already for more than half done too less than 20 parties. So is it really neccesary to wait untill the rest is given to smaller parties?
Then again the benefits of a higher price seemed also to be the incentive to use the protocol by farming. It increased the compounds protocols popularity among an ever steady growing landacape of defi protocols that jump on the hype.
When the price of the token drops almost everyday, this doesn’t seem like a good choice to allocate some funds or even hold on to it. It also may risk losing the network effect gained previously…possibly.
A dividend would certainly incentivise holding on even when a price drops.
Lets wait and see the when somebody will propose it. Thanks for your insights.",72,19.4,2020-07-23
['Dividend on COMP'],From a securities law point of view it would be much safer to finish the COMP distribution before trying to monetize the protocol.,71,44.2,2020-07-23
['Dividend on COMP'],"Do you mind elaborating here, @monet-supply?",75,15.0,2020-07-24
['Dividend on COMP'],"Having studied Compound for the few weeks (as I’m shorting COMP) this is what I’ve found on this topic so far. The website describes COMP’s utility as follows:

Compound (COMP) is an ERC-20 asset that empowers community governance of the Compound protocol; COMP token-holders and their delegates debate, propose, and vote on all changes to the protocol.

So it seems the real intend here is for COMP to be the token for governance. But Compound isn’t fully giving up control just yet. About 40% will be distributed over 4 years to the community, some are with investors and most are still with Compound and the team. (Although I found it hard to get good info on this) So for the next few years Compound will likely keep the ability to jump in and veto any proposal they really don’t like. So while the ultimate goal is decentralized governance, this is still a few years away I think.
As mentioned before here and on discord, one of the issues with dividends is that it could means COMP is seen as a security. So until the 4 year distribution is done or Compound registers COMP as a security or something like that… it may cause real legal issues for Compound if COMP paid dividend.
The second issue with this is that currently a small fee goes into the reserves. These reserves exist to cover black swan events in which case Compound goes insolvent. Paying dividend would come out of these reserves and would increase the risk a black swan event poses. I think the reserves are still rather small at the moment. Last I checked there was around $1.4M in all reserves combined. And even with the yield farming going on now it’s only growing by something like $6.500/day.
So the parties who currently have the voting power for COMP seem to view COMP as intended: the governance token of Compound. If you are interested in voting on decisions regarding Compound, buy some COMP. Or better yet, use Compound to receive COMP.
Since most vote holders are on this forum, please correct me if I’m mistaken anywhere, because all my comments here are second hand hearsay and educated guesswork.",71,79.2,2020-07-28

['Dividend on COMP'],@Tim - diluting the coin is not a great idea. One idea could be to take a small portion of each transaction on the COMP and apply it to a master fund pool to be distributed as dividend for holding $COMP and a portion used to improve the protocol.,46,14.2,2020-08-26
['Faster way to real community governance'],"The Compound team seems keen to let the community control the protocol. However, because the vast majority of tokens are still in the hands of a limited set of partners who were gifted the tokens, in reality they are the ones governing the protocol. Users earning COMP of buying COMP have close to no voting power. So if the goal is to have the wider community govern, why not delegate voting power to small holders of COMP.
In short, Compound still has a few million COMP under their control I believe. Setup a way for anyone with a little COMP to get some of that COMP delegated to vote. So your COMP gets like 20x voting power.
There are other ways to do this too. If the goal really is to have the wider community govern, there are many ways to achieve this.

We do have a sense, from talking with some of the largest $COMP holders, that the high limit on proposing a vote may be preventing some votes from happening that actually do have widespread support and would significantly benefit the platform.
We’ve been proposing for a while to add support for TrueUSD (and at some point other TrueCurrencies as well) to the Compound platform.




TrueUSD Listing Proposal New Markets


@rleshner- the benefit to $COMP holders is diversification beyond the 2 assets that drive the overwhelming majority of Compound usage today, as well as significant increased usage of the platform, something that, right now, our stablecoins are the assets most likely to provide. 
Compound is one of the DeFi projects that I personally am most excited about. It’s got great technology, great design, and a widely respected token model. I think it’s going to be successful long-term, but to get there, i…
  

We’ve talked privately with some of the folks that hold 100k $COMP, and one thing that surprised us was that the holders we talked with so far do think it would be good for the platform, and would vote in favor if someone else proposed it, but are unwilling to propose the vote themselves for optical reasons. I get where they’re coming from- if you’re a big fish, you have relationships with many projects, including other stablecoins, and you need to think about how it would look for you to be the one to propose a vote for adding TrueCurrencies to Compound. You don’t want to be seen as playing favorites.
While this kind of logic makes complete sense, note that it’s not optimizing just for what’s best for the platform. Large players really do have many other factors they need to consider. Note that we haven’t talked with all of the large holders, and this pattern may not hold for all of them, but we do know that it’s an important factor at least for some.
In votes from the Maker community, adding support for TrueCurrencies has gotten 99%-100% support across 4 different votes for 4 different TrueCurrency products. Part of how Maker gets around the issue with proposal limits is that they have a larger number of indicative votes before the final votes to add assets.
We suspect that an indicative vote (or a lower proposal limit) would show that there is actually widespread support from $COMP holders to add TrueUSD to Compound, but because of how the voting system currently works, it’s difficult to know for sure.",21,19.2,2020-08-26
['New Vanilla cTokens'],"Recently, there’s been interest in listing new ‘vanilla’ cTokens – cTokens whose underlying ERC-20 is provably basic and no different than other existing cToken behavior. These are tokens which don’t and can’t do anything special on transfer aside from moving balances and modifying allowances. Vanilla tokens are somewhat easier to add to the protocol, since they don’t pose any new threats to the protocol, and therefore require less intensive auditing.
Obtain Price
For listing a new vanilla token, probably the biggest barrier will be ensuring the underlying asset has a price in the price oracle. The new Open Price Feed provides a framework for doing so.
Use cDAI Delegator
In listing a cToken nowadays, the Compound team recommends using the upgradeable form of the contract. At the time of this writing, the only upgradeable cTokens are cDAI and cUSDT. There was a minor optimization made to the delegator contract before deploying cUSDT, which created a quirk by returning extra bytes that some ABI-decoders have difficulty with. Thus the recommendation is to merge this PR which reverts the contract back to its previous form, making it easy to deploy new cTokens without the padding issue, and which map to a commit in the ‘official’ repository.
Other Gas Optimizations
There are some other improvements that could be made fairly generically to the cToken implementation contracts, if one were so inclined. However these should not be made without proper auditing. One potential change is removing CarefulMath and/or moving to reverts everywhere instead of Failure codes.
Perhaps the lowest hanging fruit would be to remove the *Verify hooks from the end of each cToken call.

As of now there is over $5 million worth of Ren already deposited. There seems to be a lot of demand for Ren and Compound may benefit from its addition to the protocol.
What is RenVM?
RenVM serves as the engine that powers our decentralized interoperability solution.
RenVM provides one of the only practical interoperability solutions that can scale. It is also the only solution that allows for secret computation over multiple inputs and multiple parties. RenVM is not a product or an application in and of itself, it is a network (and an accompanying SDK) that allows developers to bring cross-chain functionality to their DeFi applications.
What are Darknodes?
RenVM is powered by a network of machines called Darknodes, earning rewards for contributing compute power and storage space.
RenVM is network powered by decentralized virtual machines. This virtual machine is replicated over thousands of machines that work together to power it, contributing their network bandwidth, their computational power, and their storage capacity. These machines are known as Darknodes.
What problem does RenVM solve?
RenVM enables the trustless and decentralized exchange of value between blockchains - bringing interoperability to DeFi.
This directly enhances DeFi’s utility by adding more liquid assets to the Ethereum ecosystem. Regardless of the DeFi app, RenVM can provide a native cross-chain user experience allowing seamless and decentralized interoperability for the first time ever.
What can be built with RenVM?
RenVM serves as an plug-in for decentralized finance and therefore, any DeFi application can incorporate RenVM’s capabilities into their applications and existing smart contracts.
If your project would benefit from cross-chain liquidity, then you stand to benefit from integrating with RenVM. Extra care has been taken to ensure RenVM is composable with existing blockchain and DeFi applications.",37,287.4,2020-07-21

['Ren as a supported asset'],"Well, in that case, renBTC seems less likely to lose it’s peg than WBTC. So if using the BTC price should be good enough then.
I just realized this post was about $REN not $renBTC. I think adding renBTC is more in line with the goal of Compound. For me a major use case for Compound is to take a dormant asset and loan against it. The largest asset in crypto is BTC, so being able to borrow against that is in my mind the primary use-case of Compound.
Let’s look at some of the criteria for adding an asset:
Accurate price feed
Since we are happy to use BTC for WBTC, this should be ok since renBTC is secured by over 1000 nodes and REN collateral and WBTC is held by a centralized party we have to trust.
Sufficient liquidity
renBTC has limited liquidity on DEXs, however, there’s unlimited liquidity on the renBridge because anyone can mint renBTC from BTC or release BTC from renBTC without any registration or KYC. So in the case where the price of BTC drops and it leads to large liquidations, liquidators will have no problem receiving renBTC as they can convert that into BTC quite easily.
General token security
The security doesn’t rely on any central party or any oracle. The biggest security threat would be a major bug in the RenVM blockchain software, which is currently being audited. I would recommend that we wait until the audit is published, which should be soon.
So as someone who hasn’t been gifted 100.000+ tokens, what can I do to further this proposal? As a developer, I’m happy to prepare the code changes needed, etc.
My motive for this is of course selfish. I have some bitcoin sitting around and I would like to put it to work. I don’t trust a single party like WBTC, but I do trust renBTC. Once I can supply renBTC to Compound, I can borrow stablecoin against it and put that to work to earn interest (as well as farm some COMP). Also hodling some REN.",18,63.6,2020-08-25

['Update cUSDT interest rate model'],"We think some of the changes are good but the parameter choices seem somewhat arbitrary. While we are supportive of this particular proposal as a form of dollar-denominated rate equalization, we think that future rate changes should de minimis be chosen in a data driven manner and ideally via simulation. Given the rapid changes in rates due to yield farming powered by Dai and COMP, data driven rates will provide significantly more leeway for the protocol to react to adverse farming events.
Below, we propose a few simple models for a data-driven IR model:


Base Rate: Should be the risk-free rate of the asset e.g. for DAI, the base rate can be either DSR or stability fee rate. For ETH, the base rate can be the ETH 2.0 staking interest rate.


Kinks at x% utilization: this number should depend on the suppliers’ supply asset distribution. For example, using  1 - top supplier supply %   to define the Kink. The intuition for this heuristic is as follows: when the asset’s liquidity is too low such that the top holder can’t withdraw all his supplied assets, the system will try to aggressively push the interest rate up. If the asset supply is more centralized, the utilization to trigger crossing the kink will be lower. If we apply this simple methodology to the three stablecoins in Compound we find that:




The top USDT supplier is supplying roughly 18% of the cUSDT, so USDT kinks at 82%
DAI kinks at 74%
USDC kinks at 72%



Borrow rate at kink: Have this match the empirical highest APR for supplying assets in the other platform, e.g. Curve or Uniswap LP return. This rate should be risk adjusted based on current yield farming behavior (e.g. force be more conservative when there is a multiple sigma event due to farming)


Borrow rate at 100% utilization: not sure whether there is a good way to come up with a reasonable number, since the goal for this is just to disincentivize borrowing demand. It could be 3x or 5x of the borrow interest rate at kink.


Given these methodological constraints, we believe that a 0% base rate and a kink at 80% utilization would be a safe, conservative route [0]. Based on USDC’s 73.4% utilization, we project that the current equilibrium point for USDT is around 10% borrow interest rate [1].
— Gauntlet Team
[0] We note that the implied 4% borrow rate at the kink might be too low and will effectively push the utilization to a neighborhood of the kink. Validating this conclusion with simulation is future work that we aim to perform.
[1] We’re doing a back-of-the-envelope calculation to rescale USDT’s behavior to that of USDC, where we have a much higher empirical utilization (partially due to Dai creation).",35,172.0,2020-08-17

['New Member - Intro and Questions'],"Hi everyone!
I’m proud to say today was my first day using any DeFi application. I’m an avid crypto enthusiast, and just staked a small amount on the Compound application. If all goes well, depending on my understanding of the application and how it works, I’d like to be a more active member in the community and stake more on the app. I have done research, but I haven’t found any soup to nuts, simplistic answers to some of my questions/concerns. I apologize if they are “dumb” questions to any experts, but I am a novice and not only am I very interested in just being apart of this community and the space as a whole, but I’m trying to bridge the gap a bit here. So I figured there would be no better place to learn than from the forum itself. Here are a few questions:
-As a Compound user, I see that there are APRs for borrowers and stakers, do you receive comp payouts for borrowing on top of staking as well? So let’s say you stake 200 DAI and then borrow 150 DAI, do you get COMP distributions for both numbers at the rated APRs?
-I see for both situations there is a DAI APR and a COMP APR, do you get interest on the DAI as well?
-I’m unsure if I fully understand the interest utilization model provided on the Supply numbers page, if someone could just elaborate a bit. Does it have to do with the percent  of let’s say DAI being lent out/borrowed at any given time and then the system appropriates an interest rate to the lenders depending on that utilization schedule?
-And lastly, when you vote on a proposal, does the compound you have/control in your wallet get staked to a “Yes or No” vote, or does it get burned/dissipate every time you vote?

Compound is a lending platform, therefore, all lenders earn interest and all borrowers accrue interest. These values are in the same currency as the deposit/loan.
Completely separate from all this, Compound is distributing COMP to its users. You earn COMP for borrowing and lending. COMP is used for voting and is never removed from your wallet to vote. It isn’t lost by voting in any way.",43,28.6,2020-08-06

Ok so you do get rewarded COMP utility tokens borrowing as well.  Answers my question, thank you! So the next question is, let’s say I have a balance of 1000 DAI. I then lend out 1000, then I borrow the max on that stake. Let’s say it’s 750. Do I earn for only The 1000, or do I earn on the total 1750
And thank you for the response about the governance voting. So the COMP doesn’t get burned, it’s just the more COMP tokens you own, the higher voting percentage you have. Correct me if I’m wrong.
Also, was my assumption about the interest table correct? Depending on how much on the platform is staked at any given point drives the interest up/down

You receive COMP based on all activity in the protocol; in your example, on the 1750 DAI. This is slightly controversial (and could be changed through the Governance process).
The more COMP you own (and choose to vote; you can also assign your votes to anybody else, while keeping the COMP), the higher your voting percentage.
Yes, each market has it’s own interest rate model. You can see these models on the asset page (e.g. USDT), and compare how interest rates change based on the utilization of that market.

['Open Price Feed Proposal Development'],"In order to migrate to the Open Price Feed, the community should be convinced that it’s a good idea, or discover reasons why it’s not. This topic exists to discuss and publicly review the technical merits of the proposal. This project has been developed 100% transparently in this public repository on GitHub.
We view this oracle change as a final milestone in decentralization the protocol, by removing the permissioned poster role. The current mechanics are designed for an off-chain reporter anchored to an on-chain price. The prices coming from Coinbase off-chain must agree within a 20% tolerance of the prices coming from Uniswap on-chain, otherwise they will be rejected.
A full specification for the proposed oracle can be found here.
Source Code
The branch for active development of the Uniswap Anchored Coinbase Reporter View can be found in this GitHub pull request.
Coinbase Reporter
The Coinbase Reporter reads from the Coinbase Price Oracle.
In an extreme circumstance in which Coinbase believes their reporter key may have been compromised, the reporter also has the ability to sign an ‘invalidation’ message. Anyone may post this message to the chain, and the Open Price Feed will fall back to only using the Uniswap anchor prices, until a new oracle can be chosen.
Uniswap Anchor
A certain amount of time (anchor period) is elapsed before the contract is fully initialized. From that point on, whenever prices are posted, the Uniswap price accumulators are read, and updated if a new anchor epoch is possible. The time-weighted average price (TWAP) is the difference in the current and epoch forming accumulators, divided by the amount of time elapsed. In this way, we guarantee the accumulators are at least a certain distance apart, and thus the TWAP is taken over a long enough period of time.
In practice, we expect 30 minutes to be long enough to make Uniswap price manipulation attacks prohibitively expensive, however this also comes with some assumptions about the size of the market that must be considered. See also this discussion of oracle integrity and this analysis of price manipulation.
Adding New Tokens
The oracle is designed to support pricing tokens before or after they have a cToken wrapping them. Listing new tokens requires deploying a new view contract however, as all configuration variables are immutable. We also intend to post prices for a few more tokens which have reported prices, and which can thus be added to the protocol without changing oracles again.
What kind of quality assurance has been done?
Fundamental Tests
We are still in the process of testing this code, which involves rigorously writing unit and integration level tests.
Open Zeppelin Audit
The code is currently being audited, we expect to have an initial report by the end of this week. The code can then be adjusted as needed based on feedback, and with additional testing.
Protocol Forking Simulations
We are working on creating hypothetical simulations demonstrating that the proposed new oracle, if elected, continues to operate successfully within the protocol.
Formal Verification
We are working with Certora to formally specify and check properties of the contracts. We are still integrating feedback based on their analyses and findings. See the pull request in the GitHub repository for tracking changes.

['Borrow Limits Rules'],"With the Borrow Limits patch code completed, it is now time to decide on a set of rules that the community board will follow when setting the borrow limits. If approved by the governance process, this board will control a multisig that will act as the Borrow Limits Guardian. The community board will consist of 6 addresses with 4 required consensus: two controlled by members of the compound team and 4 by the community.
This set of rules dictates how the community board sets market borrow limits. It aims to keep limits as tight as possible without restricting normal use of the protocol. Here is something to start off with.
Stable Coins: USDC, USDT, Not DAI
130% of max borrowing in past 14 days
DAI excluded for now due to sporadic farming usage.
If borrowing comes within 5% of the limit, it will be raised ASAP to the new calculated level unless malice is detected.
Non-Stable Coins: ETH, WBTC, ZRX, BAT
110% of max borrowing in past 14 days with a floor of $3M.
If borrowing comes within 5% of the limit, it will be raised ASAP to the new calculated level unless malice is detected.
We will have a bot setup to monitor the market conditions and notify us when adjustments are required. Additionally, every other week, limits will be recalibrated in case they need to be lowered.",46,149.2,2020-07-31
['Borrow Limits Rules'],"Arr00, thanks for spearheading this - and starting the discussion before the proposal to add borrowing limits to the protocol gives everyone a nice chance to think throw the how/why of how it will function.
I see two primary approaches to setting borrowing limits:

Governance sets borrowing limits, and these change infrequently; the Borrow Limit Guardians step in only in emergencies (when a 5-day governance process is not sufficient).
The Borrow Limit Guardians set borrowing limits; Governance is available as a fall-back (or veto).

Everyone is welcome to weigh in with this poll:




COMP Governance sets Limits; Guardians in emergencies
Guardians set Borrowing limits; COMP Governance can veto




0
voters




My personal opinion is that, because this is a new system (and an extremely useful one – thank you!!), using the Governance process to set borrowing limits might create more widespread support for changes (and an understanding of them). Once clear policies have been established, and are working well, the Guardians can take over to relieve the overhead on Governance.
In terms of policies, it’s possible we start slowly, and only use borrowing limits to protect the protocol from extreme scenarios. The first that comes to mind are the BAT/DAI yield-farming trend in which the borrowed volume of the asset exceeded the asset’s total supply; capping borrowing to 50% (or even 100%) of the total supply of an asset seems like a logical protection.
Would love yours and others thoughts.",43,53.6,2020-07-30
['Borrow Limits Rules'],"I agree that I may have gotten a bit too ambitious with this proposal and things should be taken slower. It is logical for governance to set high limits initially while the community learns about the new feature. Eventually, Borrow Limit Guardian can take control and start setting tighter limits if the community wants.
While It’d be a nice idea to be able to limit borrowing to 100% of farmed asset’s total supply, I don’t believe this is the correct method to do so. Setting the borrow cap to 100% of DAI supply would immediately disable all borrowing of DAI which could obstruct normal liquidation operations. A supply cap is the way to go here, but as we’ve realized previously, that is a much more extensive protocol change.
If governance is setting limits, I’d advocate for high limits on all assets. This would show system functionality and add some safety but not restrict the protocol.",38,22.6,2020-07-31
['Borrow Limits Rules'],"If I’m understand correctly, there are sort of 2 objectives here:

Prevent an infinite minting scenario — no constraint on normal borrowing; add in human discretion to constrain abnormal behavior of certain tokens
Establish a more general borrowing cap related to protocol security & decentralization (to defend against more general token risks) — constrain normal borrowing of certain tokens (WBTC/USDT/Less liquid tokens/etc…)

If this is the case, maybe we could do something that allows for the community board to set parameters related to #1 (shorter-term, flexible borrowing limits to prevent infinite minting), while governance could manage parameters related to #2 (bigger-picture hard cap on borrowing for an asset).",32,21.4,2020-08-03

['Transaction Fees'],"At the moment the gas price on Ethereum is quite high, you can check it here: https://ethgasstation.info/
The amount you see in for instance MetaMask is the maximum amount you may be charged, but in reality the transaction will often use less gas than the maximum, so it will turn out a little cheaper. But maybe 20-50% or so, depending on the action and some other variables. Time of day impacts gas price, so that can help a little. Also, if you are very patient, you can pick a lower gas fee but it will longer  and doesn’t actually save that much. Just google ‘how to reduce ethereum gas prices’ or something for more info on this. This is not specific to Compound, all Ethereum apps are struggling with this at the moment.",30,91.0,2020-08-02
['Migrating to the Open Price Feed'],"Today, Compound Labs maintains the Compound protocol’s price feed, which has been continually in service since 2018. In order to complete the process of transitioning the protocol to COMP Governance, it’s important that the community is able to maintain & upgrade a price feed that doesn’t rely on our team, or closed-source processes in any way.
Over the past year, our engineering team has developed the Open Price Feed, which is intended to be a permissionless, upgradable price feed for the Compound protocol (and other DeFi projects).
The Open Price Feed allows Reporters to sign price data using a known public key, which Posters (any Ethereum address) can submit on-chain.
Today, Coinbase Pro is the first Reporter using the Open Price Feed format, for all assets traded on Coinbase Pro; additional exchanges are developing their own Reporters, for their own trading pairs.
Migrating to the Open Price Feed
In order to cut reliance on Compound Labs to maintain the legacy feed, we propose that the protocol switch to using the Open Price Feed with a single Reporter (Coinbase Pro), and an on-chain “Anchor price”, which acts as a sanity check (Uniswap v2 Oracle). As the community becomes comfortable with the Open Price Feed, additional Reporters, and additional assets can be added through Governance–and the Anchor removed or used as a price source itself. Here’s how it will work:
Coinbase signs prices from Coinbase Pro, every few minutes, with high fidelity. These digitally signed prices are reported through an API. This will be the first functioning Open Price Feed Reporter.
Whenever these prices are posted, they are checked against a 30-60 minute TWAP (time-weighted average price) using the assets/ETH pair on Uniswap v2; this is the Anchor price. If the Reported price is within 20% of the Anchor, it’s accepted; otherwise the reported price is ignored. In practice, we expect 30 minutes to be long enough to make Uniswap price manipulation attacks prohibitively expensive.
In an extreme circumstance in which Coinbase believes their reporter key may have been compromised, the reporter also has the ability to sign an ‘invalidation’ message. Anyone may post this message to the chain, and the Open Price Feed will fall back to only using Uniswap Oracle prices, until a new price feed can be chosen by Governance.
As additional price Reporters come online, they can be added to the system through Governance, and new standards can quickly emerge (e.g. a median of 5 Reporters, without using an Anchor).
Next Steps

The branch for active development of the Uniswap Anchored Coinbase Reporter View can be found in this GitHub pull request.
A complete development overview will be posted in the Development channel soon; we encourage the community to review, audit, and improve the contracts we are developing.

Also I hear all about chainlink as being the standard in this market, but I know nothing about them, (just angry i didnt buy them under a buck ) but like to know how this competes? and could compound provide a service like chainlink in the future as a price feed aggregator?
cheers!

This would be the first deployment of the Open Price Feed, which any other project could piggyback on to use any of the prices included, such as Coinbase or OKEx.
This proposed implementation is designed to minimize the risk of relying on Coinbase (either due to a technical, or malicious error on their part), which is already “low” risk in my opinion, and present a path for the Compound community to add more price inputs over time, without ever relying on our team.

I wanted to repost an idea I shared a while back in Discord, related to the idea of absorbing price data from organizations who aren’t willing to provide a conforming feed (whether to avoid liability, or because it’s a technical burden, or whatever):

In the original Open Oracle System article, it mentions “Reporters” as the first step in the chain. This is someone who is the ultimate source for a certain piece of price data. An example would be Coinbase as the source of prices on the Coinbase exchange. The article imagines the Reporter as an active participant, bearing the burden of signing and publishing this price data. It might be hard to get reliable price sources like Coinbase to volunteer to act as Reporters, not least because of the legal liability they might perceive they are taking on. But as it happens, Coinbase is already publishing signed price data through their existing HTTPS-based APIs. The SSL key on their server is effectively signing the payload of the API responses. Projects like TLSNotary (https://tlsnotary.org/) show how to use the SSL stream to create a proof that a message was sent from the server in question.

['Borrow Limits for each Market Comptroller patch'],"With the addition of WBTC collateral, many people have been talking about putting up more safeguards to avoid total loss in an infimint situation. While without migrating WBTC to a new cToken, I don’t think a supply cap is possible, but blck and I thought it’d be beneficial if we implement borrow limits for each cToken to reduce potential losses.
For example, ETH is rarely borrowed, so why should it be possible to borrow the whole supply when the only possible situation for that happening will be a compromised collateral infimint?
Borrow limits will be set by the admin or guardian and borrows will gracefully fail if the borrow amount brings total borrow above the set limit. The limits will be set high enough to enable normal usage but minimize loss of funds. I still believe that a supply cap is a much better solution and this restriction can be disabled if a supply cap is implemented in the future.
I have submitted a PR on GitHub with the code. A preliminary version is currently the Comptroller on Kovan. It has a borrow limit of 10,000 * 1e18 underlying for all assets. Currently, I am working on writing tests for the new patch.
This is a preliminary idea for starting borrow limits. These numbers are mostly random to help start discussion on what they should be. Setting the borrow limits will be successive calls in the same governance proposal after setting the new comptroller.
Things to discuss: what should the initial borrow limits be for each asset, does this comptroller patch need to be professionally audited, do we like this idea, should the guardian have full reign over the borrow limit?

Does this need a separate guardian? If it’s an “admin” function, it can be controlled through COMP Governance naturally. Would a 5 day proposal period be inadequate, or risky?


Yes, controlling the borrow limits will definitely need to be controller by the pause guardian or a different guardian. Without borrowing ability, many liquidators may have issues liquidating larger positions. Additionally, we don’t want to be getting in the way of normal usage or clogging up governance proposals with these minor changes.
We were thinking of a guardian with ability of changing borrow limits being a community multisig like you recommended for the pause guardian. It would make sense for this to be a different guardian, as it will be used in somewhat normal situations.


What is the impact on gas costs of each type of transaction, to add these checks?


Haven’t looked into this yet.


Can you describe the logic, and how it works? Do transactions revert, if a transaction would exceed the cap?


I tried to make the implementation for the new feature match existing compound code.
The additional logic is placed in the borrowAllowed function in the Comptroller. If the market has a borrowLimit set which is greater than 0, it does a safe addition of the new borrow amount with existing total borrows. If the result is greater than the borrow limit, the borrow function fails gracefully, returning an error code.
I return an error code because for almost all existing compound failures, error code are returned instead of reverting. The only time I see functions reverting in compound is authentication and when markets are paused. Additionally, returning an error code allows for the accureInterest to stay on chain.",41,23.2,2020-07-19
['Borrow Limits for each Market Comptroller patch'],"I disagree. The idea of the new borrow limit is to restrict borrowing to expected amounts for normal usage. This is just extra security against an infimint situation and will potentially save hundreds of millions in funds.

['Dharma to Submit Update to cDAI Interest Rate Model'],"Summary
Over the past several weeks, Dharma has written and tested an updated interest rate model for cDAI. This updated interest rate model allows for the following parameters to be updated by governance proposal (ie. no-code updates):

Interest Rate at 0% Utilization
Interest Rate at 100% Utilization
The Utilization % at which the model “kinks”
Interest Rate at the “kink”
Toggle for whether to couple the cDAI interest rate to DAI Savings Rate in Multi-Collateral DAI

We believe this model can form the basis for the interest rate models of other cAssets, including cUSDC and cUSDT, which we believe should have models of a similar nature. We encourage other community members to adapt this code to do so, and will enthusiastically support proposals to update the interest rate models of other cAssets to models of this format.
We intend to submit this update as a formal proposal on Thursday, 23 June 2020.

['On Interest Rate Models'],"One of the defining features of the Compound Protocol is its use of algorithmic interest rate models. Interest rate models have been ‘utilized’ by the protocol since its inception. The original whitepaper introduced a basic linear model, based on the idea of  utilization , or the percentage of a money market’s supply that is currently being lent out. By and large, this is the model that is still used today in most Compound markets. Interest rate model experimentation will be one of the most exciting things to watch on Compound, but it’s important to understand the differences between existing models before proposing new ones.
For a given cToken, it is important to look at which style of model it uses and make sure that the right one is used. The markets which use the old style are: cBAT, cETH, cUSDC, cREP, cSAI, cUSDC, cWBTC, and cZRX. The markets which currently use the new style are: cDAI and cUSDT. New markets would naturally continue to use the new style. Keep reading for further explanation about the different ‘styles’.
Background
The core idea is that the more cash available in a market to be borrowed, the lower the interest rates should be, and the less cash that is available, the higher the interest rates should be. Importantly, anyone can know exactly what will happen to interest rates, whatever might happen in a market. The interest rate models are designed to economically incentivize liquidity, but not guarantee it. There are many degrees of freedom in choosing a model that provides this incentive, and we have barely scratched the surface, as far as exploring this design space.

cDAI 2-legged rate model: borrow rate vs utilization
With multi-collateral DAI, we introduced the first ‘2-legged’ model, which uses two lines to set rates, instead of one, but is still rather primitive in many ways. The new cDAI was also the first upgradeable cToken contract, which gave us a chance to make some key changes to the core contract, and also paved the way for making future enhancements and optimizations easier.
One of the biggest changes was an interface change to the interest rate models, such that modern models return just a single value which represents the rate in question, and not an antiquated error tuple. This itself was part of an even larger shift of overall mindset, where we started to prefer reverting in general, to propagation of error codes. We could write several articles on the evolution of error-handling within Compound, but for the sake of this one, the important thing to note is that there are fundamentally two ‘styles’ of interest rate models in use today by the protocol.
The selection of parameters thus far has been manual, and somewhat arbitrary, and long have we waited for the day to come where rate model choice could be explored in a more systematic fashion. Historically, we have preferred to launch interest rate models with hard-coded or constructor-only parameters, mainly to reduce the surface area attacks.
Another thing to note about rate models, is that markets have traditionally been tuned independently of one another. The COMP distribution changes the game in many ways, and the lack of standardized rate models has become instantly more apparent. With the USDT suddenly earning the lion-share of COMP, more and more questions are being asked about the fairness of these models.
But with decentralization of the protocol, all this context mostly becomes a footnote. The purpose of this article is to educate COMP-holders and would-be COMP-holders on how we got here, so that together they can make informed decisions about where to take things next.
Rate model styles
The 2 ‘styles’ of rate model signatures are as follows:
Old style
getBorrowRate(uint cash, uint borrows, uint _reserves) public view returns (uint, uint)
The return value is a tuple which includes an error code that needs to be checked, and the borrow rate mantissa. Old style markets may emit failure codes, or possibly revert, if anything goes wrong. Reserves were not included in the denominator for utilization calculation.
New style
getBorrowRate(uint cash, uint borrows, uint reserves) public view returns (uint)
getSupplyRate(uint cash, uint borrows, uint reserves, uint reserveFactorMantissa) public view returns (uint)
getSupplyRate is not used by the protocol directly, however new style models should include it. New style markets revert if anything goes wrong. Reserves are generally included in the denominator for the utilization calculation.
At this point in time, the 2-legged model is only implemented in the new style.
Mutable parameters
Historically we have avoided mutable parameters in the interest rate models. We felt they increased the surface area for vulnerabilities to the protocol, and increased the potency of the admin key and potential for abuse.
However, now that the Compound admin is the governance contract, which is governed by COMP-holders, the potency risk is by and large mitigated.",34,406.8,2020-07-17
['Update cDAI Interest Rate Model with Updatable Parameters'],"Context
For the past 6 weeks, Dharma has been working to rationalize interest rate models across the cryptodollars supported by Compound. We have written an update to the cDAI interest rate model, and want to open the discussion about a formal proposal of this model.
Pull Request: https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/pull/35
Etherscan deployment link to come
Updates
Our most recent proposal, Prop 12, failed as we did not ensure that our code submission adhered to the emerging standard of “pristine deploys”. While we believe our submission was safe, we agree with the community’s decision to insist upon extremely rigorous review of code updates.
We used the time since Prop 12 to create a more future-proof version of the cDAI interest rate model, which we believe is now ready for discussion and formal submission.
The new model differs from the old model in two ways:

Model Parameters are updatable via governance vote
Parameters have been changed vs. current status as per Prop 12

Updatable Parameters
Having Updatable Parameters will make changing the interest rate model substantially easier in the future. Instead of having to deploy a new smart contract and move the system to the new contract, the parameters of the contract can simply be adjusted via governance proposal. We believe this is a substantial step forward in terms of governance process.
Changed Parameter Values
Per Prop 12, we have changed the values of the cDAI interest rate model to set higher interest rates and a different target utilization point. Specifically, these changes are:


1.Change APY at 100% util:
a. Current: 15%
b. New: 25%


Change the Utilization Rate that defines the “kink”:
a. Current: 90%
b. New: 80%


Change APY at “kink”:
a. Current: 2%
b. New: 4%, double the  gapPerBlock . [edit on 1 July: the new APR at kink is actually 4.34%, due to an increase in DSR that was recently approved by MKR governance.]


No change to Base Rate per Block (APR at 0% utilization):
a. Current: 0%
b. New: 0%

['Collecting votes to add OGN as a supported asset on Compound'],"I posted this to Comradery before realizing you moved to this new platform.
The Origin team is planning to launch a lightweight, single-purpose DAO with the sole purpose of proposing that OGN be added as a supported asset on Compound. We have already received support from several COMP holders who are interested in bringing this proposal to an official vote.
We’re working on a smart contract to aggregate votes. Once deployed, COMP holders will be able to delegate their votes to this smart contract which will in-turn propose that OGN be added as a supported asset on Compound once it reaches the required 100,000 votes. This “DAO” will have no additional purpose or the ability to vote on future proposals. Voters will be encouraged to remove their delegated votes after the vote is complete.
Why this would be good for Compound
Origin has a large and active community that could help bring new users to Compound. Our email list is over 250,000 strong. We have over 62,000 people in our various Telegram groups, as well as 64,600 Twitter followers and 68,000 members on Blockfolio Signal. We have a very strong presence in Asia with full-time employees focused on Korea and China as well as other Asian countries that are less familiar with Compound.
Origin has a suite of working products, a well-respected team, and a track record of shipping code. We’re long-term believers in this space and are deeply committed to the success of Compound and the broader ecosystem. We’re optimistic that DeFi will eventually attract the masses that borrow/lend in order to finance real-world commerce, such as the purchase of goods and services on Origin decentralized stores and marketplaces.
In addition, regardless of whether OGN is added as a supported asset on Compound with this DAO and subsequent proposal, we believe this process will be a strong example of how decentralized governance can work in action. Just like DeFi has composability, we believe decentralized governance should have composability, and this will be a great way to test the chaining of two governance votes together.
About Origin
Origin is building a platform for blockchain-powered commerce. Origin’s goal is to enable true peer-to-peer commerce by disintermediating middlemen to reduce or remove fees, improve censorship resistance, and to reduce platform risk for developers and merchants.
Origin was founded in mid-2017 in San Francisco and the 20-person team includes one of the founders of PayPal, the first engineer at YouTube, and former engineering managers from Google and Dropbox. Origin conducted token sales in 2017 and 2018, raising $38.1M, led by Pantera Capital with participation from Foundation Capital, Kyber, Blockchain.com, QCP Capital, and Alexis Ohanian (co-founder, Reddit), Steve Chen (founder, YouTube), and Garry Tan (partner, Y Combinator).
The Origin Marketplace is live on the Ethereum mainnet and our decentralized stores are used by many well-known players in the crypto community including Brave, Solana, Contentos and Kyber.
About OGN
Origin Token (OGN) is a multi-purpose ERC-20 token created to fuel the growth of the Origin network. OGN enables an affiliate/advertising platform, incentivizes end-users to use and share the platform, and transfers value between buyers and sellers as a payment token. In addition, OGN will be used for on-chain governance purposes in the future.
Address: 0x8207c1ffc5b6804f6024322ccf34f29c3541ae26
Type: ERC20
Decimals: 18
Supply: 1,000,000,000 OGN
Holders: 25,536 addresses
Origin Tokens are being slowly released to presale investors, team members and advisors based on a gradual release schedule that’s available on the Binance Research report and the Origin’s Token dashboard.
Potential concerns
Liquidity
We recognize that liquidity is important for the security of the platform. OGN is currently listed on top exchanges like Binance and Huobi and is currently being considered for listing on Coinbase. Daily trading volume has ranged between $5M to $133M, with the average over the last 30 days coming in slightly over $17M. We’re aware of the concerns that have been raised in previous proposals concerning the low liquidity of wBTC and the increased risk for liquidations. While we recognize that OGN would be on the lower end of the liquidity spectrum, we have a couple of orders of magnitude more liquidity than wBTC.
Other platforms
Composability is one of the most interesting parts of DeFi, and OGN is already available on other DeFi platforms like Uniswap, Kyber, Balancer, and more.

Custom functionality
The OGN contract has a custom approveAndCallWithSender function that is based on ERC-827 that allows OGN to be approved and transferred to a whitelist of addresses in a single step. We added this function to improve the user experience for users of the Origin marketplace. While adding complexity, we do not believe it adds any security considerations for our token or the security of Compound.
Admin rights
The OGN contract is owned by a 5 of 8 Gnosis mutisig contract which has been audited by OpenZeppelin, ConsenSys, Origin’s team, and others. While we can’t reveal the identities of the keyholders for security reasons, we can share that the keys are held by individuals with close ties to the company. Our keyholders have been instructed to manually double-check every proposal for accuracy before granting approval. The keyholders are highly intelligent and ethical individuals. My cofounder, Matt, and I have known and worked with many of them for years and we trust them to protect the best interests of all token holders.
Like many other widely used tokens, we included the OpenZeppelin libraries that enable minting, burning and pausing. We included this functionality solely out of a desire to reserve optionality in an unknown future. We have no current plans to use it and have put careful processes in place to prevent both accidental and intentional abuse. Even as founders acting together, Matt and I do not have enough control to execute those owner functions on our own. We recognize that burning any externally owned tokens could do irreparable harm to our reputation and value of our token. As a result, this external burning capability would only be used under extreme circumstances and with community support.
While we’re not ready to revoke ownership of our token contract altogether as the network is still developing, we are open to adding a Compound-inspired timelock in front of any admin function calls if that will make a difference for the community.

We at Compound will do our best to keep the master branch in sync with the on-chain Protocol (and help keep test-nets up to date as well). That said, we do not control the on-chain Protocol and deviations may occur. We also encourage forking the Protocol if you want to develop patches separately. Finally, the Protocol has many iterations of contracts and you may need to view earlier commits to find relevant code.
Comparison to Standard Open-Source Projects
Compound is a living on-chain protocol, not just a repository of code that you pull and run. Commits in the repository represent mere suggestions for upgrades to the Protocol. Once a patch is built, it needs to be proposed to the Compound Governor system and accepted by vote by a majority of COMP holders. As such, expect that the process of filing issues, vetting pull requests and merging code may be substantially different from other code repos you have interacted with in the past. These changes are meant to help get your patch approved by the community.
How to Submit a Patch
Style & Conventions
The most important principle in writing code for this project is clarity. Code should be as obvious as possible. We’ll always prefer clear over clever. The following are a list of principles to follow to lead in the right direction for your patch.

Prefer local context. Try to not do too much in one function. Do not hide complexity by calling into complex sub-routines. Inline code when it would be more clear, even if you repeat it (e.g. require(msg.sender == owner) is clearer than checkAuth()).
Avoid complex Solidity features, such as modifiers and external libraries.
Variables should be clearly named, even if it makes the name long. You can use Hungarian-like notation for variables like supplyAmountMantissa, here indicating the value is a real number with 18 decimals of precision.
Your code should be clear without comments (though feel free to add comments if they do add clarity).
Prefer the order “checks, effects then interactions,” and generally avoid cross-contract interactions where possible. Additionally, avoid interspersing computation with effects and interactions (e.g. if you can calculate a value upfront, do so).
Try to match the code-style that already exists in the repository. Please do not refactor existing code styles.
Public functions should have NatSpec documentation, including: a notice briefly describing the purpose, what the parameters are, and what the return value is.

Testing & Auditing

The protocol has several layers of testing: unit testing, integration “scenario” tests, and formal verification.
All contributions should have total code coverage. You may use harnesses, etc, but try to test your code as realistic as possible. You can see your coverage on codecov.io. Note: the accuracy of the coverage tool is not authoritative; if you can show your lines of code were covered, that’s sufficient.
We prefer having scenario testing, as well, which is a DSL for interactions with Compound. These tests will give significant extra confidence in your code changes. See SCENARIO.md for more information.

Scenarios can also be used in conjunction with Web3 forking to test the outcome of implementing a given change.
If you have a question, feel free to ping us in Discord!


You may contribute to formal analysis for your patch, but that is not a strict requirement. The formal verification tool we use is currently closed-source and not generally available.

If you want to build on the K Framework, we would be supportive.



Unit Tests and Scenarios
Unit tests can be found in the /tests directory. Scenarios are located in spec/scenario. To run both unit tests and scenarios, use:
yarn test

Scenarios automatically get compiled into unit tests, thus e.g. to run an individual scenario:
yarn test tests/Scenarios/Governor/VoteScenTest.js

Test-nets & Deployment
Every change should be run first on test-net, with source code verified and bytecode matched, just like on mainnet.
Saddle can be used to deploy, verify, and match code, though it need not be. All of the example commands can also be run from Docker builds, to run against a given commit. A private key can be passed via the ACCOUNT environment variable, or a file (e.g. ""~/.ethereum/kovan"") containing newline separated keys. Hardware wallets are not yet supported. See the README and assorted documentation for more information about compiling and using the code in this repository.
The easiest way to deploy and update the networks configuration files at the same time is to create an executable scenario script, like this one and run it like so from the repository directory:
spec/sim/0001-comp-distribution-patch/deploy.scen

Etherscan Verification
Contributors should make it as easy as possible for others to inspect their source code and audit their changes. Verifying source code on Etherscan is an important part of doing that.
For example:
npx saddle verify -n mainnet ETHERSCAN_API_KEY 0xAf601CbFF871d0BE62D18F79C31e387c76fa0374 Comptroller

Bytecode Matching
Contributors should prove to themselves and others that the bytecode on-chain matches other versions that are compiled from the same source. Saddle match is a tool that can help do that.
For example:
npx saddle match -n mainnet 0xAf601CbFF871d0BE62D18F79C31e387c76fa0374 Comptroller

Making a Proposal
At a high level, a proposal should make a minimal code change to achieve the desired result. The contributor should demonstrate that the code achieves the result, as best as possible. Anyone should be able to see what the code on-chain is, and verify that any changes match a particular diff in source control. The bytecode should identically match what is obtained by compiling the changes in this repository or a fork, as of a specific commit. The steps in detail are as follows:

Develop your code, unit test, scenario test and simulate your changes
Open a pull request for peer review and community auditing

See these pull requests for example
Iterate until all issues are resolved


Deploy contracts to test-net

Verify your contract on Etherscan
Saddle match your contract
Record deployed contract addresses and deployment arguments


Craft a proposal for test-net making the change

You may need test-net Comp to propose the change; you may include your proposed change in a post on the Compound Governance forum for support.
Alternatively, you can deploy a full Compound test-net using Eureka and test your change there.

If you have questions about Eureka, ping us in Discord!


After the proposal has passed, manually test the change and have others help with quality assurance.


Deploy your contracts to mainnet, preferably identical to your test-net deployment

Verify your contract on Etherscan verify
Saddle match your contract
Record deployed contract addresses and deployment arguments
Simulate the effect of ratifying a proposal with the actual deployed contract using a fork

Another great place to reach out to us or the community if you have questions on how best to do this.


The proposal should match exactly the one that will be voted upon


Craft the proposal on mainnet

You may need to find a sponsor with sufficient COMP to vouch for and propose your change.
Simulate after creating, that passing the actual proposal in a fork behaves as expected



Conclusion
We understand there are a lot of steps here, but your patch will have a potentially huge affect on a large number of people, so we should be vigilant to provide the highest-quality code we can offer. If you have any questions, feel free to ask here, in Discord, on GitHub or on Twitter. Remember: the Compound Protocol is governed by all of us, so we need to work together to keep the protocol up to the highest possible standards.",70,3269.0,2020-07-16
['Good Governance'],"Transitioning governance of the Compound protocol to the community is the most exciting, and powerful experiment we’ve ever conducted.
It’s up to all of us, working together, to create the governance standards and processe that will carry Compound forward for years/decades to come—standards that ensure that the protocol is resilient infrastructure for developers, and a series of predictable financial markets for end-users.
Previously, I’ve laid out some principles for how I vote as an individual COMP token-holder; now, I’d like to share some thoughts on what I believe good governance looks like. The community can adopt, extend, modify, or reject any/all of this as you see fit - these are notes, to start—and I’ll try to keep this updated by incorporating your suggestions.  Please weigh in .
Discussion
Governance Proposals should all start with community discussion, questions, and analysis; a single forum post in the Ideas is a great way to organize conversation on a topic.
The goal, at this stage, should be to add as much knowledge & information as possible about the effect of a potential proposal. Either by adding data/analysis, or by asking questions that can lead to more insight. Saying you like or dislike an idea is fine, explaining why is better, backing it up with information why is best. Suggest alternatives; and keep an open mind.
Give the community time to process your ideas, and add their own.
Know the Tools
All changes to the protocol modify data stored on-chain; changing a parameter from A to B, or changing a contract address (e.g. which contract to use) from X to Y. It’s important to understand how the protocol works, and the difference between parameters, and contracts. If you’re not sure whether a proposal would modify a parameter or contract, what something means, or how it works, just ask!
Changing a parameter is simple; it introduces no new code, and very likely no technical risks.
Risk Parameters:

Reserve Factor
Collateral Factor
Liquidation Incentive
Close Factor

COMP Distribution Parameters:

COMP Distribution Speed
Add Market as Eligible for COMP
Remove Market as Eligible for COMP

Changing a contract is complex; any change will introduce new code, and potential technical risks. The primary modular contracts are:

cToken Contracts
Interest Rate Models
Comptroller (Risk Model & COMP Distribution logic)
Price Feed

Lastly, there are administrative functions, and traditional on-chain functions that can be called by Governance proposals; these likely introduce no new technical risks, but should be carefully considered:

Reduce Reserves
ERC-20 Transfer
External function calls

Introducing New Contracts
Any proposal that introduces new code should be thoroughly audited by the community, with technically capable members of the community weighing in.
Development should be conducted in the open; pull requests, code diffs, test cases, and sample deployments of new code should all be completed for the community to inspect. Expect this process to take time.
Significant changes should undergo a professional third-party audit; this can be paid for by the Compound Governance system by removing reserves. Together, we’ll develop standards for introducing complex changes—but until you’re completely satisfied that a proposal introduces little technical risk, fight against it.
Creating a Proposal
In order for the community to weigh a your proposal, they need to know which parameters or contracts would be changed (and to what). Create a discussion in the Proposals category, focused on a narrow set of changes, and not try to suggest multiple scenarios or changes simultaneously.
Use this as an opportunity to solicit support, answer questions, and build public support. When you feel that the proposal has a high likelihood of success, create it. Let the community know, and be ready to engage in active dialogue about your proposal. COMP will speak for itself, and the economic incentive to protect & grow the protocol should carry the best idea through.",50,440.0,2020-07-13
